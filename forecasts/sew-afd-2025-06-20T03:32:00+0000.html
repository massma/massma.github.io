Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
832 PM PDT Thu Jun 19 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Wet and cooler weather returns Friday and Saturday as
an upper level low moves overhead. Mountain snow is expected
above 5000 ft. Warm and dry conditions return early next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Not much to add this evening
regarding the upcoming change in the weather. Shower coverage will
increase through the day on Friday. Models continue to lock into the
idea of the most widespread precip coverage being early on Saturday
as moisture wraps around the departing upper low. Sunday will be a
transition day as temperatures rebound and drier conditions return.
Summer in its recent familiar form returns for Monday and Tuesday.
Conditions are still slated to cool down a bit for the later half of
next week, but the jury is still out on how significant of a cooling
trend it will be. Previous discussion follows with updates to marine
aviation portions.  27

A dry a mild day for western WA today with temperatures in the 60s
to lower 70s - right around average. A deep upper low with shift
inland Friday and Saturday leading to cooler and wetter conditions
across western WA. Through Saturday, total rainfall ranges from
around 0.25-0.50" in the lowlands with 0.50-1.00" in the mountains
and foothills. The air mass will be unstable Friday afternoon for a
chance of thunderstorms over SW WA too. The wettest period will be
Friday night and Saturday morning. Up in the mountains, snow levels
will drop to around 5000 ft with a few inches of snow on the higher
peaks. Forecast highs both Friday and Saturday are only around 60
degrees, or around 10 degrees cooler than average for the interior.

The upper low will weaken and shift farther east on Sunday. We may
still see a few light, lingering showers in the interior and
Cascades but we`re only expecting an additional trace to a few
hundredths (if anything). The air mass will moderate a little bit
with highs tracking closer to average again. 33

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Weak high pressure brings
warmer and drier weather back to western WA early next week.
Temperatures in the interior will reach the mid/upper 70s to
lower 80s in the interior (peaking on Tuesday). The coast will be
cooler and in the 60s with northwest flow. Showers return mid to
late week with troughing over the Pac NW. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
