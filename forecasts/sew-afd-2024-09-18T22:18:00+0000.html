.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak high pressure holds over the region through Thursday
with morning clouds but afternoon sunshine. Expect a return to a
wetter pattern Friday and again late in the weekend as the next
disturbance crosses the region, though considerable uncertainty
remains in the pattern by early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Temperatures are
climbing through the 60s this afternoon across western Washington
with even a few spots around 70 degrees as the morning cloud cover
has continued to steadily scatter out across parts of the region.
Will continue to see some lingering cloud cover - especially
nearer to the mountains - but the bulk of the drizzle or light
rain has now ended. Expect a return of low clouds and some patches
of fog again tonight toward daybreak, but another largely dry day
is expected on Thursday with temperatures similar to today, or
perhaps a couple of degrees cooler in a few spots. A passing upper
level disturbance may provide just enough forcing a few light
showers in the mountains late in the day Friday, but these
shouldn`t amount to much and this impulse will largely just
provide a reinforcing push of clouds into the region. A stronger
weather system is likely to approach the region late in the day
Saturday. While it`ll likely remain initially centered to the
north, expect rain chances to return to the far northwestern
portions of the area through the day.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Zonal flow remains in
place across the far northeastern Pacific though the weekend,
which will continue to maintain precipitation chances across the
region. Expect the passing trough to bring a more organized shot
of rain (and high mountain snow above 8000 ft or so), and while
QPF amounts trended a little higher (around a tenth to a quarter
inch in the lowlands and a half inch to an inch for the coast and
mountains, highest north), there does remain some uncertainty with
respect to where the moisture plume will end up and if it will
track more into southern B.C. or more squarely across Washington.
As a result, expect to see some fluctuations in the forecast for
the next several cycles and hopefully the ensemble guidance begins
to come into better agreement. Nevertheless, confidence dips even
lower toward the middle of next week with about half of the
guidance favoring a ridge bringing a warm up and some drier
conditions, but still about half of the guidance favoring an
eastern position in the ridge that would leave the region open to
a more active pattern and cooler/wetter conditions. Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow aloft as weak upper level ridging
remains offshore. Conditions have significantly improved since
earlier, with bouncing MVFR/VFR ceilings across the area. Expect
this trend to largely continue, with ceilings lifting to low end
VFR into this evening. With rather light surface flow expected
tonight, likely will see a redevelopment of MVFR/IFR patchy fog
and stratus throughout most terminals late tonight into Thursday
morning. VFR will return around 21-23z Thursday afternoon.

KSEA...MVFR conditions early this afternoon will slowly rebound
back to VFR by 00z. N/NW winds around 5 to 8 knots this afternoon
will become light overnight into Thursday morning. Ceilings will
lower once again tonight around 07z-10z to MVFR, with at least a
25% chance of IFR conditions through 16z.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface low will continue to shift southward away from
our area with benign marine conditions over the coastal water
zones this afternoon. A weak surface trough will expand offshore
Thursday into Friday which will boost northwesterly winds over the
outer coastal waters to small craft advisory levels.

Along with northwesterly winds, combined seas will rise to 7 to 9
feet into Friday, highest in the outer coastal water zones. Seas
will then decrease to 5 to 7 feet into the weekend, as tranquil
conditions return.
