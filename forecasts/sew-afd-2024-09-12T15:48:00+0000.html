Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
848 AM PDT Thu Sep 12 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Weak upper ridging will produce drier conditions
across the area today into Friday before another upper level
trough arrives early in the weekend with additional chances for
some precipitation. Drier conditions are expected early in the
coming week before potentially unsettled conditions return.
Temperatures will remain slightly below normal.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No updates to the forecast
this morning, the following discussion remains on track.

Weak upper ridging will continue to nudge into Western Washington
early this morning as the upper trough that brought widespread
shower activity on Wednesday continues to progress eastward into
the Northern Rockies. With light surface winds and lots of low
level moisture hanging around, we can expect some pretty murky
conditions around much of Western Washington through this morning.
We`ll see some sun breaks toward afternoon, but that is likely to
be the extent of things. Upper ridging over the area is already
beginning to flatten by early Friday as another upper trough and
associated front slips southward down the British Columbia coast.
Some rain will reach portions of the coast by late Friday
afternoon then spread to the interior Friday night into Saturday
morning. A convergence zone looks likely to form behind the front
Saturday afternoon into Saturday evening. Temperatures throughout
the short term forecast period will average a few degrees below
normal.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...An upper level trough will
settle over the area on Sunday, but shouldn`t produce much more
than a few showers. A glance at the ensembles indicates that the
flow will become more amplified heading into early next week as
broad upper ridging takes up residence well offshore while a mean
trough position develops over the western third of the lower 48.
In this scenario, the flow over Western Washington becomes
somewhat split. Weak upper ridging will produce drier conditions
Monday, but confidence in the forecast quickly drops off Tuesday
into Wednesday. Both deterministic and individual ensemble members
show a considerable spread in the track of a system diving
southward near or to the west of the area before it eventually
cuts off. Current NBM forecasts have some fairly high PoPs for
Western Washington Tuesday into Wednesday, but it wouldn`t take
much of a shift in the system track to scale those back. Either
way, the signs of autumn are well underway and temperatures are
set to remain a little below normal for mid-September. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow aloft as an upper-trough continues
to push off to the east and a shortwave ridge builds into the
region from the west. Onshore flow resides in the lower levels.
Conditions are a mixed bag across the terminals this morning,
ranging from VFR to IFR in areas of fog and low clouds. Ceilings
look to lift back towards VFR between 18-20Z. An additional round
of low stratus is expected to move in overnight into Friday
morning and looks to lift and scatter again by the afternoon.

KSEA...MVFR conditions, with fog in the vicinity of the terminal.
Fog will continue to scatter over the next hour. Ceilings will
rebound to VFR between 18-20Z. Light SW winds will increase to 4-8
kt around 19-21Z before becoming light again overnight.
Redevelopment of low stratus expected Friday morning, with
probabilistic guidance showing 50 percent chance of MVFR cigs
developing at the terminal near 12Z. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface ridging will build across the coastal waters
today followed by transient, weak surface troughing into the
weekend. Onshore flow looks to persist throughout the upcoming
week. Westerly winds through the Strait of Juan de Fuca between
10-20 kt Thursday night into Friday. It is a borderline situation
with Hi-Res guidance indicating a 50-60% chance of SCA gusts up to
25 kt are possible within the Central/Eastern Strait for a few
hours this evening before diminishing overnight into early Friday
morning.

Seas 6 to 8 ft over the outer coastal waters this morning before
decreasing to 4 to 6 ft by the evening. Seas will continue to
gradually subside again towards 3-5 ft again over the weekend.
