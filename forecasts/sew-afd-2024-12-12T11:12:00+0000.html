Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak weather disturbance will bring the chance of
lowland rain and mountain snow on Thursday. A stronger system will
move into the region on Friday bringing gusty winds, lowland rain,
and mountain snow to Western Washington. A wet and active weather
pattern will likely persist through midweek.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Current satellite shows
a low pressure system spinning off the Oregon Coast bringing some
high clouds into the region. This may help mitigate the fog in
some areas and improve the visibility. Radar imagery also shows
light showers starting to move into the region from the south. The
low pressure system is expected to move southward towards
Northern California, thus keeping the majority of the moisture
centered to that area. As a result, rainfall amounts are expected
to be light with this system on Thursday. Snow levels at the
passes with this system are expected to be between 2500 to 3500
ft. Some light snow accumulation is possible, around 1 to 2
inches.

On Friday a stronger system is expected to impact Western
Washington bringing gusty winds, widespread lowland rain, and
mountain snow through Sunday.

LOWLAND RAIN: Rain is expected to start moving into the region
along the coast on Friday morning and becoming more widespread
throughout the day and continue through Sunday morning. The
heaviest rainfall accumulations at this time are expected along
the coast and Olympic Peninsula.

MOUNTAIN SNOW: Snow levels on Friday and Saturday will range
between 3000 to 3500 ft and are expected to decrease to as low as
2000 ft by Sunday. Light snow accumulations are expected with this
system.

WINDS: Winds will begin to increase on Friday morning and are
expected to subside by Saturday evening. The strongest winds are
expected along the coast, the San Juan Islands, Whidbey Island,
Whatcom County, and Skagit County. Maximum winds gusts of 30 to 40
mph are possible in these areas.

COASTAL FLOODING: Coastal flooding will be possible starting
Friday and persisting through the weekend during the late morning
to mid-day high tides. Significant coastal flooding will be
possible along the Pacific Coast on Saturday with an inundation of
2-3 ft above ground level possible. Large waves building along the
Pacific coast could exacerbate impacts to coastal communities.

HIGH SURF: Large waves will build towards 15 to 18 feet at around
15 to 16 seconds along the Pacific Coast on Saturday. Large waves
may wash over beaches, jetties, and other structures unexpectedly.
Localized beach erosion will be possible.

MGF/14

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Precipitation should
taper off in the early morning hours on Sunday as a weak upper
level ridge begins to develop over the region. However, these dry
conditions will not last long as the ridge will quickly move
eastward and an upper level trough will push through the area
on Monday, bringing another round of unsettled weather. There is
some uncertainty in the strength and location/timing of the upper
level low at this time. By Tuesday ensemble guidance hints at an
upper level ridge settling over the Pacific Northwest and
potentially amplifying through midweek. However, some guidance
implicates the upper level ridge may not be strong enough to
completely dry out the region, as guidance still hints at
precipitation chances lingering through Wednesday.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southerly flow aloft becoming westerly later in the
day. Flow will then turn southwesterly overnight as an upper-trough
draws near. Currently, mostly VFR across the area as mid to high-
level clouds stream over. There are isolated pockets (KOLM & KBLI)
of IFR to LIFR as residual surface moisture produces fog. Conditions
should remain mostly VFR throughout the morning but expect things to
deteriorate towards the afternoon-early evening as rain showers and
MVFR cigs become more widespread. These conditions will possibly
persist overnight into early Friday with intermittent lifts to VFR
for some terminals. Surface winds generally light with speeds 5 kts
or less. The exceptions to this are HQM, with easterly winds 8-12
kts and PAE also easterly but a little less at 5-10 kts.

KSEA...VFR conditions persist into the day as mid to high-level
clouds stream overhead. However, clouds will lower towards the mid
to late afternoon. A window between 22z and 04z Friday could bring
MVFR cigs as showers increase across the terminal. Improvement to VFR
is possible afterwards but can`t rule out additional MVFR obs under
heavier precipitation. Winds generally 5 kt or less throughout the
TAF period.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak front associated with an occluded surface low is
over the coastal waters at this time. We`ll continue to see elevated
seas across the coastal waters as a SCA remains for these locations.
A strong storm will arrive Friday into Saturday with widespread
gusty winds and higher seas. Gale force winds Friday afternoon are
trending more likely as the current watch may need an upgrade to a
warning in the next forecast package. Additional headlines may also
be needed for inland waters during this time also. Conditions should
be more benign on Sunday but the pattern is showing signs of uptick
into early next week.

Coastal seas 8 to 12 feet today, rapidly building towards 15 to 20
feet (with 20+ ft possible for outer coastal waters) on Friday-
Saturday. Seas should subside below 10 ft on Sunday but could return
towards that threshold again on Monday.

.HYDROLOGY...Next round of precipitation with a weak system
Thursday will only result in small rises on the rivers. A stronger
storm will set up along the coast over the weekend with the
potential to bring more significant precipitation to the region.
While area rivers will rise, only the Skokomish River is currently
expected to reach minor flood stage Saturday into early Sunday.
Additional rounds of precipitation could keep the Skokomish river at
or near flood stage into early next week.
