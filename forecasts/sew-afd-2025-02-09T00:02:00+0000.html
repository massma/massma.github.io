.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light scattered showers will continue to move through
Western Washington and should taper off into the evening hours.
Drier and much colder conditions are expected to start Monday
night and last through Wednesday night. The next weather system is
set to arrive to Western Washington by late next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Current radar imagery
shows scattered light lowland rain and mountain snow showers
continuing to move across Western Washington. These showers are
expected to taper off into the late evening hours.

An upper level trough continues to push eastward through Western
Washington keeping the chance of light scattered rain snow showers
in the forecast through the weekend. A drier airmass settling over
the region on Saturday afternoon will limit snow chances to the
mountains. The lowlands may see some flurries through Sunday
morning, but no accumulations or impacts are expected. Drier
conditions expected to last through the middle of next week.

Very cold temperatures are expected to begin Monday night as a
positive tilted upper level trough advects much colder air into
Western Washington. These colder temperatures are expected to
last through the middle of next week. Abundant cloud cover on
Sunday will keep overnight temperatures in the upper 20s to low
30s; By Monday, little to no cloud cover will drive low
temperatures into the upper 10s to low 20s. On Tuesday, low
temperatures will be slightly colder with temperatures in the 10s
to low 20s along the coast. Apparent temperatures look to approach
Cold Weather Advisory criteria (>90% chance) for Monday and
Tuesday night. Guidance is also hinting at another Fraser River
Outflow event possible Monday night into Tuesday morning, which
will drive apparent temperatures to approach the 10s and single
digits in Whatcom County. High temperatures Monday through the
middle of next week will struggle to increase past 40 degrees.

With overnight temperatures below freezing, any lingering
moisture from melting during the day will refreeze and result in
black ice.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Cold overnight
temperatures will continue on Wednesday, with low temperatures in
the upper 10s to low 20s. Low temperatures will gradually begin
to increase slightly after Thursday. By Saturday low temperatures
will be in the upper 20s to low 30s.

Long-range models hint that drier conditions may come to an end
Thursday night as an upper level trough is expected to start
moving over Western Washington bringing once again the chance of
precipitation back into the forecast through the weekend.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak upper trough continues to slide across the
region today with increasingly northwest flow. Predominantly MVFR
conditions across western Washington with ceilings gradually lifting
(and even a few breaks) other than under current shower activity.
Expect this trend to continue through evening with temporary lower
conditions under steadier showers. Winds remain generally light with
weak surface gradient, but expect variable direction with the shower
activity. With light winds and the air mass stabilizing, expect
ceilings to lower mostly to MVFR range.

KSEA...Snow/rain showers will remain with mostly MVFR ceilings.
Showers taper into evening and ceilings may lift a little bit, but
in general only little change. Expect winds mostly light and
variable direction overnight. Lower ceilings around 1500 ft favored
late tonight through the morning push with a return to higher VFR
ceilings as the air mass dries and winds increase late Sunday
morning.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure returns over the waters. Minimal marine
weather concerns with small waves and light winds, though some
showers could bring variable wind directions as they pass.
Otherwise, high pressure building over the interior of British
Columbia will strengthen early in the week to increase for modest
offshore flow and Fraser River outflow. For now around a 30-40%
chance of seeing winds increase to advisory strength, but seas will
also steepen over the waters downwind of the strongest outflow. A
weakening trough will approach the coastal waters late next week,
for a return of stronger winds and larger seas over the waters.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
