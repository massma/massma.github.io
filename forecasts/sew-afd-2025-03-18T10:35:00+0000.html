.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Temporary weak upper level ridge building over Western
Washington today. The ridge will shift east tonight with the next
front approaching the area Wednesday. Front moving through
Wednesday night into early Thursday morning with rain and locally
windy conditions. Another system riding a somewhat strong jet
stream will reach the area Thursday night into Friday followed by
a system Saturday. Possible atmospheric river setting up Sunday
before lifting north Monday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows a
lot of clearing over area early this morning with the upper level
trough axis to the east. Dying convergence zone moving into the
Cascades south of I-90 while a stronger convergence zone moves
into the Cascades of Snohomish County. With the clearing skies,
temperatures have dropped into the 30s in most places. A couple
locations in the South Puget Sound reporting temperatures just
below freezing at 3 am/10z.

Weak upper level ridge trying to build over the area today. Both
convergence zones will continue to weaken and will be gone by
sunrise. Still a few showers embedded in the west northwesterly
flow aloft off the coast. These showers will move over mainly the
southern portion of the area. Even with the weak ridging, the air
mass will be slightly unstable this afternoon so will have to
keep a chance/slight chance of showers late this afternoon.
Temperatures with plenty of sunshine will only warm to near 50.

Upper level ridge shifting east tonight with the leading edge of
the precipitation out ahead of the next front approaching the
coast by 12z Wednesday. What little shower activity that develops
late in the afternoon will dissipate in the evening hours.
Increasing clouds overnight will keep low temperatures a little
warmer than this morning, in the mid 30s to lower 40s.

As has been the case with numerous systems lately, front stalling
off the coast with cool upper level trough digging south near
130W slowing down the eastward movement down to a crawl. Rain
developing along the coast in the morning with the rain trying to
spread inland in the afternoon. As the front slows down
southeasterly surface gradients increasing creating breezy
conditions along the coast and over the Northwest Interior,
including the San Juans and Admiralty Inlet.

Splitting front moving inland Wednesday night. Wind advisory
strength winds likely over the Northwest Interior, San Juans and
Admiralty Inlet. Rain over the entire area with snow in the
mountains. Southwesterly flow aloft favors the highest snow
amounts on the volcanoes, Mount Baker and Rainier. Snow advisory
amounts likely with possible warning amounts at Baker and Rainier.

Front east of the area Thursday morning. Windy conditions with decent
post frontal onshore flow easing in the afternoon. Next system
being pushed by a 130 knot jet aimed at Western Washington
spreading rain back into the area in the afternoon and evening
hours.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Models in good agreement
initially with the system moving east of the area Friday. Good
post frontal onshore flow. Another round of advisory snow amounts
in the mountains with snow levels just below the passes. Model
consistency falls apart over the weekend into the first part of
next week. Operational ECMWF has another system arriving Saturday
with a possible atmospheric river Sunday lifting north Monday. The
operational GFS is much slower with the Saturday system and has
the atmospheric river moving inland mostly north of the area later
Sunday into Monday. GFS ensembles are more in line with the ECMWF
solution with a large percentage of the solutions wet Saturday
through Monday but precipitation amounts do not reflect an
atmospheric river event. The ECMWF ensembles in pretty good
agreement with the operational run. Still plenty of time to refine
precipitation amounts but given the GFS ensembles will at least
go with categorical pops most of the weekend and at least likely
pops Monday. Snow levels rising during the weekend peaking around
7500 feet Sunday night into Monday. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A quick moving upper level ridge will pass over
Washington today. This will push the trough east of the Cascades out
of the state today before a cold frontal system arrives on
Wednesday. Flow aloft will become more northwesterly today, and
shift to southwest Wednesday.

Convergence zone showers/winds continue in two pockets (southern
King County south of I-90 and another pocket on the Snohomish/Skagit
County border). Hi-res guidance has these showers winding down this
morning, which will give a break in shower activity until late
tonight/Wednesday morning. The ceilings this morning have remained
VFR (but some pockets of MVFR remain associated with the convergence
zones this morning). Guidance shows ceilings remaining VFR through
the day, with cloud coverage increasing ahead of the next front.
Only caveat will be the potential for localized IFR areas in the
KPWT and KOLM vicinity (but cloud coverage overnight may hinder low
spots outside of the Cascades). Winds will return to the southwest
this morning (from any convergence zone activity at 4 to 8 kt).
There is increasing potential for gusty winds Wednesday with the
front moving through (with gusts over 20 kt possible in the
afternoon).

KSEA...Convergence zone activity has cleared. Winds have return to
the southeast at 7 kt, and may turn to be more southwesterly today.
Ceilings expected to remain primarily VFR through the day today
(couple MVFR clouds are possible with remnants of the convergence
zone moving out).

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A quick surface ridge will move across the waters
Tuesday. A vigorous trough will drag a cold front across the region
on Wednesday, which is expected to bring rain showers and gusty
winds. The highest winds are expected over the coastal waters, where
increasing S/SE winds are expected to reach the higher-end of gale
warning threshold (40-45 kt). A couple isolated storm force wind
gusts cannot be ruled out in the warning area, but the probability
is low. The gusty winds will cover all remaining inland waters
Wednesday into Wednesday night. Small craft advisories have been
issued for south winds of 20-30 kt. Couple gale-force wind gusts are
possible in the East Strait of Juan de Fuca and Northern Inland
Waters (these areas may be upgraded to a gale warning in a later
update as more hi-res guidance becomes available).

The winds will drop briefly on Thursday before another front moves
across the region late Thursday into Friday. This pattern is
expected to continue to remain active with additional periods of
breezy winds through the weekend with unsettled weather.

7 to 9 ft seas will increase to 13 to 18 feet early Thursday,
decreasing to 10 to 12 feet Thursday night and 8 to 10 feet Friday
through the weekend.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Waves of precipitation moving through Western
Washington into early next week. Lower snow levels through Friday
will keep river rises minimal. Higher snow levels along with
increasing precipitation this weekend will accelerate river rises
but at this time only the Skokomish River in Mason County is a
threat to go above flood stage. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
