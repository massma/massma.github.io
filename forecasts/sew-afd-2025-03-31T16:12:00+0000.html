Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
912 AM PDT Mon Mar 31 2025

.SYNOPSIS...An area of low pressure offshore will produce
scattered showers across Western Washington today. A broad trough
will remain over the area into midweek for a chance of showers and
near seasonal temperatures. High pressure aloft will build into
the region toward the end of the week for dry conditions and
temperatures trending well above normal by the weekend.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The current forecast
remains on track today. 33

Previous discussion...Scattered showers continue to rotate
onshore across Western Washington this morning around a broad
trough of low pressure offshore. We`ll see something of a lull in
shower activity later this morning before the next upper
disturbance rotates northward across the area for an uptick in
activity this afternoon and evening. High temperatures today will
cool to slightly below normal. The low pressure center will move
onshore over Oregon early Tuesday. Showers chances will linger
across Western Washington, but most areas will be dry much of the
day with the best probabilities for precip in the mountains. An
increase in onshore flow could lead to a brief convergence zone
Tuesday afternoon or early evening. Broad upper troughing remains
over Western Washington into Wednesday for a continued chance of
showers and temperatures remaining a little below normal.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Significant changes in the
pattern begin to take place on Thursday and ensemble clusters are
showing strong support for this now. Broad upper troughing will
take up residence over the interior Western U.S. while relatively
high amplitude ridging offshore starts to build into the Pacific
Northwest. A drying trend will commence on Thursday with the ridge
starting to build into the area. A multi-day warming trend is
expected Friday through Sunday with 500 millibar heights climbing
to near 575 dam or better by Sunday with the ridge axis overhead.
At the same time, the low level flow will turn offshore this
weekend. Combined with 850 millibar temperatures of 12 to 14 C by
Sunday, this would be enough to push quite a few lowland locations
into the 70s. I can hear the lawn mowers already. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southerly flow aloft today becoming more variable

to 10 kt with gusts up to 20 kt possible between 18-22z. Wind
gusts will subside greatly post 00z but maintain a southerly
component. Ceilings look to lower Tuesday morning.

.HYDROLOGY...The Skokomish River will remain in action stage into
midweek, but overall QPF through the week ahead does not look
sufficient to produce any flood concerns there or along any other
rivers across the region through the upcoming week. 27
