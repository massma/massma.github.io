Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
702 AM EST Tue Jan 14 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
A series of surface troughs pass today into tomorrow morning
before high pressure takes over late tomorrow into tomorrow night.
An approaching frontal system dissipates to the west of the area
Thursday into Thursday night. High pressure will then briefly
build into the area on Friday ahead of another frontal system that
passes through the area on Saturday. A series of frontal waves
will then pass near or south and east of the area late Sunday into
Monday.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
For this early morning update, minor adjustments were made to
temperatures and dewpoints to account for current trends. Cloud
cover was also increased across portions of the Lower Hudson
Valley in the morning based on current satellite imagery.
Otherwise, the forecast remains on track.

As a cold front pushes east of our area this morning a low
pressure system in southern Quebec moves east into the Canadian
Maritimes. High pressure noses in from the southwest today. As
the low moves further into the Canadian Maritimes, the pressure
gradient over our area will increase, leading to increasing
breezy NW flow with wind gusts tonight maxing out around 25-30
mph.

Cold air advection will also aid in gusty NW flow, but also lead to
colder temperatures. Highs today will be in the low-30s (south and
east) and in the upper-20s for northwestern interior locations. Lows
tonight will drop into the mid-20s to upper-teens.

An midlevel trough over Michigan today will dig into the northeast
this evening into tonight, aiding in strong winds and cold air
advection. The midlevel trough will also bring some positive
vorticity advection. At the same time, this evening into tonight a
surface trough will also pass over the area. Both of these will act
to increase cloud cover this evening into early tonight. Dry air
looks to be very strong, keeping precipitation chances down. Its
very likely we stay dry. However, trough may allow from so lake-
effect streamers to make it just far enough to impact the area. The
chances of this look low, so have kept only slim chances for
isolated flurries in the forecast this evening into early tonight.
No accumulation is expected.

&&

.SHORT TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
An increased pressure gradient remains over the area tomorrow
morning as surface low pressure moves east of the Canadian Maritimes
and high pressure noses more into the area from the southwest.
Another surface trough is also expected to pass in the morning, but
expecting to stay dry. Breezy NW flow will continue in the morning
with gusts again peaking 25-30 mph.

As the mid-level trough moves east of the area offshore later in the
day, surface high pressure is then able to center itself more over
the region, leading to a decreased pressure gradient and weakening
winds. Mainly sunny skies are also expected as a result. Highs
tomorrow remain on the cold side of things in the low-30s to upper-
20s.

A modest mid-level ridge centers itself over the northeast tomorrow
night in response to a larger upper-level trough digging into the
Great Lakes region. Lows, again, return to the low-20s to upper-
teens tomorrow night.

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
The last in a series of shortwave troughs will drop across the
Northeast Thursday with the associated frontal system dissipating to
the west of the forecast area. Expect an increase in cloud cover
during the afternoon and evening hours with perhaps a chance of
flurries or a brief snow shower. However, have kept the forecast dry
at this time. The upper trough will then lift out late Thursday
night into Friday morning with brief upper ridging and surface high
pressure building across the area. This will also mark the start of
a short warmup with temperatures by Saturday 5 to 8 degrees above
normal.

At the same time, Pac energy that briefly breaks down the ridge
across western Canada and the PAC NW along with northern branch
energy descending south across central Canada will carve out a
longwave trough encompassing much of the Lower 48 over the weekend.
Guidance has come into better agreement with a more progressive cold
front at the leading edge of the trough that tracks across the area
Saturday afternoon/night. Expect mainly rain showers in a
strengthening deep-layered southerly flow.

Differences then arise with the orientation on what will be a
positively tilted upper trough covering most of the country. The 00Z
Canadian continues to dig jet energy along the backside of the upper
trough much farther west as compared to the ECMWF and GFS, taking
the energy across the intermountain west Saturday into Sunday and
then out into the Central Rockies by early next week. This results
in a strongly-tilted positive upper trough that sends waves of low
pressure along an arctic front toward the area early next week.
However, the GFS and ECMWF allow the arctic air to spread out to the
south and east quicker with the frontal boundary much farther south
and arctic high pressure encompassing much of the country east of
the Rockies by early next week. This scenario would keep the storm
track displaced well south and east. For the time, like the NBM have
maintained low chances for snow Sunday night into Monday.

Arctic air spills into the area Sunday night into Monday with highs
likely not getting above freezing on Monday.

.AVIATION /12Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Terminals will be between high pressure to the southwest and a broad
area of low pressure across eastern Canada and the Northeast. A weak
trough passes through the area this afternoon into early this evening.

VFR. Chance of flurries this aft/eve.

WNW winds (290-300 true) will steadily increase this morning to
15-20kt G25-30kt. There could be some drop off this evening, but
overall little change through Wednesday morning.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Onset of highest gusts this morning may vary by 1-2 hours. Winds
may drop off some this evening.

.OUTLOOK FOR 12Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

Wednesday: VFR. NW winds 15-20G25-30kt.

Wednesday night: VFR. NW winds G20-25kt in the evening.

Thursday - Friday: VFR.

Saturday: VFR, becoming MVFR with rain showers likely.

.MARINE...
SCA conditions remain on all waters through today, tonight and into
the day tomorrow. Early tonight, peak wind gusts may reach 34 kts on
ocean waters. There is still some uncertainty if we`ll achieve gale-
force wind gusts on ocean waters tonight into early tomorrow.
Therefore, the Gale Watch has been maintained due to confidence
being too low to upgrade to a Gale Warning. Early tomorrow night
winds may drop below 25 kts on non-ocean waters followed by ocean
waters later in the night tomorrow.

Light freezing spray is possible in most of the Long Island Sound
and part of the ocean starting today and remains possible until
tomorrow night. Thereafter, winds will weaken, reducing chances for
freezing spray.

Expect sub-SCA conditions as a frontal system dissipates to the west
on Thursday and high pressure builds over the area on Friday. A
strong frontal system moving into the area Saturday will be preceded
by a strengthening S/SW flow, which could produce SCA conditions
Saturday night.
