Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
911 AM PST Mon Feb 24 2025

.SYNOPSIS...An atmospheric river pattern will maintain wet
conditions across western Washington into early this week, with
periods of moderate to heavy rain and strong winds. Conditions
are favored to dry out towards mid-week as high pressure develops,
with potential for more widespread light precipitation next
weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No significant changes to
the forecast this morning. The previous discussion can be found
below along with updated and aviation sections:

Lingering shower activity will continue to stream northward early
this morning as weak ridging aloft allows conditions to briefly
dry out. A deepening low offshore will bring in the next round of
impactful weather, lifting a frontal system northward across
western Washington today that will generate strong winds and
widespread precipitation alongside high seas. While forecast
models still show some variability over the exact track of the low
pressure center, confidence is high that this system will produce
strong winds region-wide and periods of moderate to heavy
precipitation. Winds will be strongest along the Pacific Coast,
where gusts up to 60 mph are possible early this afternoon through
early Tuesday morning before the low pressure center shifts
onshore and weakens. Ensembles show a high (60% to 70%) likelihood
of wind gusts reaching 50 mph later this evening into early
Tuesday morning across the lowlands south and east of the Puget
Sound, including the Seattle and Tacoma metro areas, with a slight
chance (20% to 30% probabilities) of gusts reaching 60 mph. Winds
will peak in the late evening and early overnight hours before
easing into Tuesday. The long duration of these winds may
exacerbate impacts, especially along the coast where power outages
are likely. The convective nature of this storm system will also
allow for locally heavy showers to develop, producing heavy
precipitation at times and carrying enough instability for more
lightning strikes today. This system will bring an additional 1 to
3 inches of liquid for most areas through Tuesday and up to 4
inches over higher elevations of the Olympics and Cascades, which
will cause continued elevated river flows across western
Washington. With snow levels lowering to 3500-4000 ft, the
mountains will see significant accumulating snowfall over higher
elevations. Higher Cascade mountain passes, including Stevens and
White Passes, will see up to a foot or more of accumulating
snowfall, with a storm total on the order of 2 or 3 feet of snow
on track for Paradise. Snoqualmie Pass, on the other hand, is
favored to see lesser snow accumulations. Precipitation will taper
off across the lowlands by late Tuesday morning as the low
weakens and shifts eastward, with showers continuing through
Tuesday night over higher terrain.

A sharp upper level ridge will develop over the region on
Wednesday, allowing conditions to dry out and advecting warmer
air into the region. Temperatures Wednesday will rebound into the
upper 50s and low 60s with some sun breaks.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Thursday will bring a
chance of light showers, mainly north of the Puget Sound, as a
frontal system splits as it shifts inland. Upper level ridging
will then rebound on Friday before breaking down on Saturday as
another storm system approaches. While forecast confidence
decreases heading into the weekend, the incoming precipitation is
expected to be light with no significant impacts.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Two rounds of rain are expected to push across the
terminals today: one later this morning and another one in the
Monday night into Tuesday, which will keep ceilings to trend MVFR.

Winds will increase Monday afternoon into Tuesday morning. Winds
will be 15-30 kt,gusting to 45-50 kt. The strongest winds will be
along the coastal terminals. Probabilities of seeing gusts greater
than 45 kt are 60-80% at KHQM, while elsewhere it is 30-50%. The
strongest winds will be Monday night into early Tuesday morning.
Easterly winds in the morning turning south throughout the day on
Monday.

KSEA...Ceilings currently trending VFR, with models hinting that it
will persist through the morning. Conditions are expected to
lower later this morning and afternoon as rain returns, with
ceilings trending MVFR through the remainder of the TAF period.

Easterly winds in the morning gradually veering south through the
day. Winds are expected to increase Monday afternoon into Tuesday
morning, with speeds of 20-30 kt, gusting to 45 kt. The chances
of seeing gusts above 45 kt are 30-40%.

33/29<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...Unsettled marine conditions are expected to persist into
early Tuesday morning. Winds will increase later today as a strong
low pressure system pushes across the offshore waters. Winds will
increase to high-end Gale Force winds across the majority of the
waters (including the inland waters), with the exception of the
Central Strait of Juan de Fuca, where winds will stay within Small
Craft criteria. The strongest winds will be along the southern
coastal waters, where Storm Force gusts will be likely. Winds are
expected to peak Monday night into early Tuesday morning. Winds will
begin to subside throughout the day on Tuesday as high pressure
rebuilds over the waters. Calmer marine conditions expected to last
late into the week as high pressure persists over the region.

Combined seas will quickly build tonight to 20-30 ft, with the
largest waves located along the southern coastal waters. Waves will
begin to subside Tuesday into Wednesday. Waves appear to remain at
10-12 ft late into the week.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The Skokomish River remains in Minor Flood Stage while
the Chehalis River continues to rise getting close to flood stage.
Other area rivers have crested and are falling, or are on track to
crest below flood stage this morning. The Flood Watch remains for
areas south and west of the Puget Sound, mainly for the Chehalis
River.

The next round of precipitation will move into western Washington
today, bringing roughly 1 to 3 inches of liquid to the region.
Snow levels will eventually lower with this storm system to 3500-
4000 ft, posing less of a threat to area rivers with the exception
of the Chehalis. The additional precipitation is forecast to keep
the Skokomish River elevated above Flood Stage, rising again above
Moderate Flood Stage tonight, then dropping below flood stage
Thursday morning. The Chehalis River will be cresting between
Tuesday and Thursday, top to bottom,  but will likely have crests
just below Flood Stage. Other area rivers may enter Action Stage but
are not currently forecast to flood.

The heavy rainfall over the weekend, combined with the additional
rain today and Tuesday, increases the risk of landslides in the
mountains.
