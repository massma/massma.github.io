Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
943 AM EST Mon Nov 27 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure tracks into the Canadian Maritimes today. High
pressure over the Ohio Valley builds toward the Mid Atlantic coast
into midweek, sliding offshore by Thursday. Low pressure impacts
the region late Friday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Forecast remains on track this morning. A sub 1000 mb low
continues to pull away from the area through New England. Skies
have cleared over most of the area for now on a gusty W flow,
and the wind will persist as temps rise to the upper 40s and
lower 50s this afternoon. Cyclonic low level flow should allow a
fair amount of stratocu redevelopment today, then skies begin
to clear this evening.

Low temps should range from 25-30 inland and parts of
central/eastern Long Island, to the lower 30s in the NYC metro
area and along the immediate coastline.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
Below normal temps expected through the period, first as an
upper level shortwave trough moves across on Tue, then as high
pressure slides to the south on Wed. High temps on Tue should
only range from 35-40.

W-NW winds increase Tue afternoon and evening as the upper
level disturbance passes by, with gusts 30-35 mph likely
especially in the metro area and closer to the coast. Still
cannot rule out a few snow streamers/flurries across the
interior mainly well north and west of NYC Tue afternoon. CAA
Tue night will yield lows mostly in the 20s. Highs on Wed should
be similar to those of Tue despite a developing return flow as a
warm front passes well north, ranging from the mid 30s inland
to the lower 40s invof NYC.

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...
The flow aloft becomes somewhat flat Thursday into Friday with a
weak surface cold front passing through during Friday night.
Dry at least for Thursday through Friday morning. The cold front
will then combine with lift from a jet streak aloft and some
mid- level vorticity for chances of rain Friday afternoon into
night. Have capped PoPs at chance for now, but wouldn`t be
surprised if PoPs eventually get bumped into the likely category
for some point during this period. Highs mostly 45-50 on
Thursday, then milder at 50-55 with a SW wind.

High pressure builds in on Saturday with dry weather and near
normal highs around 50. The high retreats into SE Canada
during Sunday with overrunning rainfall possible ahead of an
approaching warm front.

&&
