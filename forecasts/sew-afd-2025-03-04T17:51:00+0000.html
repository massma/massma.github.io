Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
951 AM PST Tue Mar 4 2025

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Radar imagery shows rain starting to push inland along
the coast. Expect rain to become more widespread across Western
Washington this afternoon. Otherwise, the current forecast
remains on track and no significant updates are needed at this
time. Refer to the previous forecast discussion and updated
aviation section below.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...A weather system will move through the region Tuesday
resulting in widespread rain, mountain snow, and breezy winds.
Drying is expected through the day Wednesday with dry conditions
by Thursday. A more active weather pattern may bring lowland rain,
mountain snow, and breezy to windy conditions late this weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...More rain for western WA
today as a cold front and negative tilted trough shift inland.
The air mass is slightly unstable along the the coast with a
chance of thunderstorms too. We`re in post-frontal flow this
evening with showers mainly over the coast and mountains. Snow
levels are around 3,000 ft with 1-3" of new snow over the Cascade
passes (with higher amounts over the volcanoes).

A cool upper low will drift overhead on Wednesday with the jet
diving south into southern CA. There`s a chance of showers
although most of the activity will remain to our south and over
OR/CA. Morning lows will dip into the 30s although most spots
will remain above freezing. Highs will reach the lower 50s or
close to average.

We`re under drier, north, flow on Thursday as a ridge arcs north
into B.C. Areas around the south sound may see freezing temps
during the early morning hours, with mid to upper 30s elsewhere.
The direr air mass will keep skies mostly clear with afternoon
highs in the 50s. 33

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...High pressure will shift
inland through the end of the week, deflecting precipitation to
our north and into B.C. Warmer weather is in store for western WA
with highs in the 50s to around 60 this weekend. A front slowly
shifts inland Sunday night and Monday for a period of wetter
weather and a few more inches of snow in the mountains. 33

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft with an approaching frontal system
spreading precipitation and lower ceilings across the region. Expect
ceilings to lower to MVFR with this front by 18z along the coast and
coaster to 21z inland. Brief IFR in heaviest rain possible for the
coastal terminals. Meanwhile, expect gusty south or southwest winds
around 20 kt for most, locally higher along the coast, just ahead of
the front. Expect this to move through quickly, with a return to
broken low VFR ceilings for most this afternoon. With residual
surface moisture and building high pressure, expect patches of fog
and low clouds developing overnight Tuesday into Wednesday
morning.

KSEA...Lowering ceilings this morning with a front approaching the
terminal. Expect MVFR ceilings and rain 20z-23z, before lingering
post-frontal showers into the evening. Ceilings this evening
expected to return to VFR at around 4000 ft, but another lowering
possible overnight 09-14z as the air mass stabilizes but remains
moist. Gusty southerly winds this afternoon with gusts around 20 kt
for a few hours 22-01z, easing this evening. 12<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...A developing low center offshore will sweep a front across
area waters starting this morning into the afternoon. This system is
bringing gusty winds falling under small craft criteria along the
west and east entrances of the Strait, and northern interior waters.
HREF guidance has wind gusts above 35 kt at 90 to 100% chance of
occurrence. This along with current scatterometer analysis increased
confidence for the issuance of a Gale Warning for the outer coastal
waters this morning before lessening in the afternoon. Winds will
gradually subside Tuesday night/early Wednesday morning below small
craft criteria. Weak high pressure will rebuild offshore late
Wednesday night into Thursday. The next frontal system looks to
approach on Friday, potentially bringing another round of small
craft winds into the weekend.

Seas 5-7 ft building to 8-12 ft by this evening. Highest seas
prevalent over the outer coastal waters. Waves will decrease
slightly on Wednesday morning, before building again Wednesday
evening/night to 9-11 ft. Another decrease in seas Thursday morning
below 10 ft. Seas will then build to 10-13 ft over the weekend.

.HYDROLOGY...No river flooding through Friday. Potential wet
system next weekend could push the Skokomish River above action or
flood stage by the weekend. There has been a lot of variability in
the rainfall forecast for the weekend. This situation will be
monitored closely through the week and could certainly change in the
next few days. The threat for river flooding on other rivers appears
minimal at this time.
