Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
340 PM PST Sun Nov 17 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Scattered showers and a slight chance of thunderstorms
remain in the forecast through Monday. A very strong and rapidly
developing frontal system will approach late Tuesday with the
potential for high winds in the Cascade foothills. The active
pattern will likely continue for the remainder of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front is well
east of the Cascades as it tracks across the Inland Northwest. In
it`s wake, scattered showers are pushing ashore western Washington
with lowland rainfall. With cold air aloft filtering in, snow has
been observed across the mountains and will persist overnight as
snow levels fall between 1,500 to 2,000 ft. To add to the fun, a
developing PSCZ is on tap to meander around Central Puget Sound.
This feature will add to the mountain snow fall as a Winter Storm
Warning remains in place for the Cascades through Monday morning.
Low-level and mid-level lapse rates are indicative of instability
as a slight chance (15%) of thunderstorms is in the forecast for
this evening as well. Low temperatures are to range between the
mid to upper 30s.

A similar story leads into Monday as we start the new week.
Showers and slight thunderstorm chances remain within this
unstable, post-frontal airmass. Minor coastal flooding is again a
possibility, mainly for Puget Sound northward towards the Strait
of Georgia during the morning. High temperatures are to top out
several degrees below average with values in the mid 40s with
overnight lows again in the 30s.

A big pattern shift will take place on Tuesday. Models are
indicating a potent upper-level jet streak cutting across the NE
PAC taking aim at the WA/OR coast. Favorable dynamics aloft over
a sharp gradient of baroclinicity will allow for explosive
cyclogenesis. Guidance continues to agree on the development of an
intense sub-950 mb area of low pressure bombing over the offshore
waters. Most notable impacts associated with the type of set up
are high winds, especially within the Cascade gaps. Just a smidge
too early to issue any wind related headlines but the threat of
power outages, damage to trees and other structures cannot be
ruled out for these locations. Along with high winds, widespread
rainfall will again enter the region as a atmospheric river
landfalls. Models have a vast stretch of moisture spreading across
N CA to SW BC. QPF totals across the Peninsula range between 1-3"
along the coast with 2-4" over the Olympics with locally higher
amounts possible Tuesday into Wednesday. Rises along area rivers
will likely result. A rain shadow across the interior should make
for lower totals. Temperatures will gradually rise Tuesday and
closer to seasonal averages on Wednesday.


.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...An active pattern looks to
remain through the long term forecast. Guidance has broad upper-
level troughing offshore ejecting disturbance after disturbance
into the PNW and keeping PoPs in the forecast. Must admit some
degree of uncertainty exists towards Sunday. But, climatologically
November is the wettest month of the year so it looks like
business as usual for the next several days. Temperatures will
hover around average.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A robust convergence zone has taken shape in Snohomish
and Skagit counties this afternoon, producing heavy rain, low cigs
and visbys, as well as gusty surface winds. The flow aloft remains
sufficiently westerly and this activity most likely will not sink
too much further south than its current position of KPAE and areas
north. Otherwise, widespread MVFR to VFR conditions are present this
afternoon, except in areas of heavy rain with IFR. Ongoing shower
activity will temporarily reduce cigs as they pass over various
terminals. The MVFR trend looks solid into the overnight hours, with
many locations bumping up into VFR on Monday as very brief surface
ridging takes place.

By Tuesday afternoon, a strong low pressure system offshore will
generate strong winds out of the east to southeast, potentially
posing cross wind concerns for runways oriented in a north to south
fashion. This threat, as well as the threat for LLWS and rain will
continue to be evaluated in subsequent forecasts.

KSEA...MVFR at the terminal this afternoon in between passing
showers moving onshore. Winds out of the south to southwest have
remained elevated, with gusts between 15 and 20 kts. This will
remain a possibility as these showers continue overhead, but
guidance is generally convergent upon wind speeds settling down to
around 7 kt after 09Z. Will keep -SHRA and VCSH in the TAF as
appropriate to note the rain showers. A brief return to VFR cigs is
possible on Monday as short lived surface ridging returns, with
winds staying out of the south at 8 to 10 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An extended small craft advisory will remain in place for
the coastal waters and western Strait of Juan de Fuca for heightened
seas and adjacent periods. Expect seas to build towards 12-18 ft by
tonight. Models have been consistent in regards to an intense sub
960-millibar surface low deepening over the offshore waters Tuesday
night. While there remains uncertainty regarding the exact track and
strength of this system, expect another round of strong winds to
develop over the coastal waters. There remains a high likelihood,
generally 50 to 60 percent chance per the NBM, that winds over the
coastal waters could blow at Storm Force criteria, prompting a storm
watch to be issued for Tuesday afternoon into Wednesday. The
possibility for gusts over 55kt cannot be ruled out. Waveheights
peak between 25 to 27 feet over the outer coastal waters during that
time.

Headlines are likely to be expanded in the Strait of Juan de Fuca
for the Tuesday into Wednesday system as well, with both model
guidance and pressure gradient data suggesting strong east wind to
blow through as well.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An atmospheric river will set up somewhere over or
near the region Tuesay into Wednesday. This would have the
potential to bring steadier rain and higher snow levels, which
could lead to the potential for flooding later this week.
