Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
133 PM EDT Fri Sep 15 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure remains centered to the north and west of the
area through Saturday night, before weakening Sunday. At the
same time, Hurricane Lee is forecast to pass well east. A wave
of low pressure passes through the area Sunday night, followed
by a cold frontal passage Monday evening. High pressure builds
in thereafter and likely remains in control through the end of
next week.

Monitor https:/www.weather.gov/okx/tropical or
https:/www.nhc.noaa.gov for the latest NHC forecasts on
Hurricane Lee.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
Adjusted high temperatures down a few degrees based on latest
trends. Temperatures have been running cooler with modest N flow
and high cirrus well northwest of Lee. Highs should top out in
the upper 60s to lower 70s, slightly below normal for this time
of year.

An upper level trough lifts toward the Canadian Maritimes today.
Meanwhile, Lee will keeps its northerly track well offshore.
Also, a surface high will remain across the eastern Great Lakes
and into the Ohio Valley. High cirrus clouds from Hurricane Lee
will continue spreading north and westward into the region.

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH SUNDAY/...
The official forecast from the National Hurricane Center takes Lee
about 275 miles east of Montauk tonight into early Saturday
morning. Lee then continues to track north, east of the New
England coast. The upper ridge to the west builds once again
Saturday, with the surface high in place, keeping Lee well to
the east. While the wind field of Lee is expected to expand as
Lee moves northward, the strongest winds and any precipitation
will remain to the east. There is just a slight chance of
showers Saturday morning across eastern New London CT and into
the twin forks.

The upper ridge and surface high weaken, and shift slowly east,
Sunday as an amplifying trough digs into the Ohio Valley to the
Gulf coast states.

&

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...
The only shot of any precipitation through next week looks to be
Sunday night through Monday. Heights aloft begin to fall Sunday
morning as an upper level trough approaches allowing more clouds to
develop. At the surface a weak wave of low pressure approaches and
likely passes over or near the area. A cold front then follows later
Monday evening. With the placement of the weak low, any instability
looks to remain to our south offshore. The better shot for any
thunder is likely Monday afternoon if we can destabilize ahead of
the approaching cold front, but currently no thunderstorms are
forecasted.

Behind the cold front high pressure builds in. The high settles over
the northeast and will remain in control through the rest of next
week. This will lead to sunny and dry conditions.

Today, winds will be mainly N at 10-15 kts with gusts up to 25
kts. KISP, KBDR and KGON will likely be a few kts higher. Gusts
may be more occasional than frequent through tonight. Winds
become more NW tonight into Saturday and a few kts higher,
likely peaking for KGON at or just under 30 kts.

Lower Hudson Valley terminals and 25-30 kt for the eastern
terminals. Wind gusts diminish Saturday night.

.MARINE...
Forecast remains on track.

While wind gusts will be marginal at gale force across the
outer area of the ocean zone east of Moriches Inlet during
Saturday, have decided to maintain the Gale Watch at this time.
Wind gusts may trend lower depending on the track of Hurricane
Lee.

A Small Craft Advisory has now been posted for the eastern Long
Island Sound beginning this morning and continuing into
Saturday as long period swells have moved into the waters. And
by Saturday morning the long period swells are expected to move
into the lower New York Harbor, and have posted an advisory
there. Otherwise, the SCAs for the remainder of the forecast
waters continue as were posted as seas remain elevated in long
period swells, with gusty winds. Small craft advisories will
likely be extended into Saturday night as ocean seas remain
elevated.

Conditions are expected to remain below SCA criteria Sunday
through Wednesday.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
There are no hydrologic issues expected through late next week.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
High surf advisory and high rip current risk continue through
Saturday evening.

For Suffolk and Nassau ocean beaches, large breaking waves will
steadily build to 9 to 17 ft in the surf zone today into
Saturday, and for Brooklyn and Queens ocean beaches, large
breaking waves will steadily build to 6 to 11 ft. This will
cause widespread dune erosion and scattered overwashes, causing
some minor to moderate flooding to roads and properties on the
landward side of the dune.

Coastal flood advisories have been issued for most of the
shoreline, with potential for reasonable worst case water
levels bringing minor coastal flooding of 1 to 2 ft of
inundation for vulnerable shoreline/coastal locations along LI
Sound, the eastern bays of LI and southern bays of LI/NYC. The
most vulnerable locations will be for north facing areas of the
twin forks, Jamaica Bay and Great South Bay exposed to open
waters from a northerly wind fetch.

Due to uncertainty of timing of surge with respect to high
tide, the contribution of wave setup and tidal piling over
several tidal cycles, and the hybrid extra-tropical/tropical
nature of this storm, the forecast has been geared to a
reasonable worst case P-Surge/P-ETSS blended forecast.
