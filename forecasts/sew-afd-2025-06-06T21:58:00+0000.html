Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
258 PM PDT Fri Jun 6 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will remained centered offshore Friday
afternoon through Saturday as dry conditions continue. By Sunday,
the high and ridge will move inland, resulting in warm
temperatures Sunday into Monday. Highs these days will reach the
upper 80s to low 90s in interior and valley areas away from
water, with lows dropping into the upper 50s and 60s. This will
result in widespread moderate HeatRisk Sunday and Monday. Once the
high moves out, temperatures will drop significantly by Wednesday
back into the 70s, further dropping into the 60s by Thursday. A
few ensembles hint at a few showers being possible late next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure remains
centered offshore in the Pacific. Synoptically a ridge is
beginning to build to the north over this high along the coast of
Alaska and B.C. Canada. Flow aloft remains northwesterly Friday
into Saturday, albeit decreasing as the jet moves east of our
area.

Satellite shows a few more clouds out there compared to yesterday.
Some high cirrus is passing high overhead, with a few groups of
cumulus hanging around the northern Cascades and Olympics (as well
as off the Pacific Coast too). Quite a few areas this afternoon
have reached the upper 70s to low 80s. It`s coolest along the
coast and to the north (few more 70s and even some 60s along the
Pacific Coast). Lows tonight will still be comfortable with low
50s across the region.

By Saturday, the high begins to track inland later in the day into
Sunday. The ridge will increase in amplitude along the Pacific
Coast up into Canada and up into Alaska. A thermal trough will
also move along the coast too closer to the surface. The
combination of all these things will lead to an increase of
temperatures going through the weekend. Saturday will see highs
climb only a few more degrees compared to Friday (few more low 80s
and upper 70s for areas away from the coast and not at high
elevations). The winds down the Cascades will become lightly
northeasterly to easterly in the evening/overnight, with winds
parallel to the Pacific Coast. This will shut off some of the
onshore flow that keeps the region cool. Lows will increase
slightly Saturday night into Sunday, ranging from the mid 50s
along the coast, to the upper 50s along the I-5 corridor and even
60 in some Cascade Valley areas. Only a couple pockets of the
South Interior will see moderate heat risk Saturday (everywhere
else will see minor heat risk).

Sunday/Monday: This is expected to be the peak of the warm
conditions with this high pressure moving ashore (and also the
hottest in terms of the daytime and nighttime temperatures). The
biggest change to the forecast is that it appears the heat will
now linger into Monday. Areas expected to see widespread moderate
heat risk Sunday into Monday were placed in a heat advisory to
cover the threat (this is primarily along the I-5 corridor up
through Everett and in Cascade Valley/Hood Canal/Kitsap areas.
Areas outside of the advisory will sill see minor heat risk (and
pockets of moderate risk away from the water). Sunday will be the
hottest day (widespread highs of 85-90 with a few valley areas up
to 95), and areas just off the coastline between 75-85 degrees.
Lows Sunday night/Monday will only drop between 55-65 degrees
(warmest areas in the valleys and the south Seattle Metro). Monday
remains similarly warm to Sunday (just a degree or two cooler and
coastal areas cooling off more with onshore flow beginning to
return). Lows will drop down too (between 50-60).

If planning to do activities outdoors, make sure to stay hydrated
and take breaks in air conditioned rooms as much as possible.
Check on pets and children. Additionally, if planning to head to
the water, use life jackets and dress appropriately for cold water
temperatures, and know the signs of cold shock.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Relief will continue to come
in with decreasing temperatures through the week. Tuesday will
likely remain warm with highs still up in the mid 70s to low 80s
in the I-5 corridor. By Wednesday temperatures will remain below
80 degrees across the entire region (warmest spots will only reach
mid to upper 70s). After Wednesday, it becomes a question in the
ensembles if some troughing is able to take shape to bring at
least a hint of moisture into the region. PoPs come back up
Thursday to 20-30% in the Cascades, and region-wide Friday for a
slight chance of showers. If the troughing pattern does take
place, highs will stay below 70 Thursday and Friday (lots of 50s
and 60s for highs with lows in the 40s and 50s).

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest flow aloft will continue into Saturday with
upper ridging building into the Pacific Northwest. VFR conditions
this afternoon with high clouds around, there is also localized
stratus along the immediate coastline. VFR into this evening with
stratus moving inland tonight into Saturday morning. LIFR cigs along
the coast Saturday morning, with MVFR/IFR expected into south Puget
Sound. At this time, the eastern extent of stratus is expected to be
around PWT to TIW, although will have to monitor any further
eastward progress. Cigs will improve to VFR by late morning and
continue through Saturday afternoon. W/NW surface winds into this
evening will become lighter tonight.

KSEA...VFR conditions with high clouds at times into tonight.
Stratus is expected to move into southern Puget Sound Saturday
morning. At this time, stratus is expected to remain SW of the
terminal Saturday AM, but will have to monitor the period between 13
to 16z for any eastward progress in stratus towards SEA. Otherwise,
VFR conditions on Saturday. W/NW winds into this evening will
transition more N/NE tonight. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure will continue to be located over the
Coastal Waters into Tuesday. A thermally induced trough will develop
along the coast on Saturday night before moving over the inland
waters later Sunday and shifting east on Monday. Small Craft
westerlies are expected at times through the central and eastern
portions of the Strait of Juan de Fuca this evening, particularly
SCA wind gusts. Onshore flow will then increase through the Strait
of Juan de Fuca Monday night and again Tuesday night.

Seas of 8 to 10 feet are expected for the Outer Coastal Waters into
Saturday morning, with choppy seas at times through Saturday
afternoon due to periods of 8 to 10 seconds. Brief SCA winds may
also occur for the northern Outer Coastal Waters into tonight. Seas
will briefly subside on Sunday, before building on Monday to 9 to 12
feet into Tuesday. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Conditions will warm up and dry out going into this
weekend and Monday as an upper level ridge develops and moves over
western Washington. This will elevate fire weather concerns as
minimum RH values will likely reach as low as 20-30% over the
Cascades and the interior during this period. While live fuels
remain wet enough to curb fire spread, dead fuels remain very dry
with below-normal snowpack and persistent drought conditions.
However, winds do remain light enough through the weekend such that
critical conditions are not expected. Moist onshore flow will return
Tuesday and into the middle of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
