Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
1019 AM PDT Sat Sep 7 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Temperatures will moderate over the weekend as a low
pressure system swings across the Pacific Northwest. Cooler
conditions with periods of showers are on track to return next
week as troughing moves across the region.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Smoke continues to filter in
aloft, producing hazy skies across much of western Washington.
Satellite shows stratus along the coast and some mid to high
cloud cover also moving in from the south, associated with some
light echoes on radar. With conditions quite dry in the low
levels, generally do not expect much rain to make it to the ground
with any showers that do make their way into the area. Only made
a few minor tweaks to the forecast this morning to reflect current
trends. The previous discussion follows below, with updates made
to the fire weather section. 14

An upper level trough will continue to push into western Oregon
this morning, causing an influx of cloud cover and some virga
showers south of the Puget Sound. A lightning strike or two cannot
be ruled out in any stronger showers that develop, though
confidence is low with forecast models showing a low (less than
10%) probability. While the dry surface layer will limit most
precipitation from reaching the ground, southerly flow aloft will
bring in more elevated haze from area wildfires. Forecast models
are in good agreement over high temperatures in the 70s along the
coast and in the 80s further inland, though slightly cooler
temperatures are possible depending on the extent of elevated
smoke that moves into the area today.

Onshore flow will increase on Sunday as the trough axis crosses
the region, allowing temperatures to continue to decrease across
western Washington. Coastal areas are on track to see highs in the
60s while inland areas see temperatures peaking in the upper 70s
to low 80s. This will allow HeatRisk to return to minor (yellow)
for most of the region apart from pockets of moderate (orange)
HeatRisk in urban areas east of the Puget Sound. Elevated smoke
aloft will continue into Sunday with slow improvement, which may
continue to impact temperatures. Forecast models highlight a
chance of showers and thunderstorm activity developing over the
mountains Sunday afternoon, though probabilities remain low.

Flow will become more zonal by Monday with increased onshore flow
and a marine stratus push in the morning. Temperatures will return
to near-normal with highs in the 60s and 70s.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Long range models continue
to favor troughing and cooler temperatures throughout next week.
Troughing will deepen offshore on Tuesday, allowing temperatures
to further decrease and introducing the next chance for showers
across western Washington. Unsettled and cooler conditions will
continue into Wednesday with rainfall accumulations of half an
inch or less, mostly across the Olympic Peninsula and Cascades.
Troughing will push eastward towards the end of next week,
allowing conditions to dry out while maintaining below-normal
temperatures.

.AVIATION...Thermal troughing moving inland today will bring back
onshore flow, yet prolific wildfire smoke from Oregon will remain
aloft. This could cause some slantwise visibility concerns
throughout the day as there will be increased concentrations of
smoke in the mid to upper atmosphere. HZ likely to be expanded in
the area TAFs throughout the day. Stratus will be moving inland
early this morning but only making it as far as the Lower Chehalis
Valley. Stratus retreating back to the coastline by 18z. Cloudless
skies for the remainder of the area with elevated smoke increasing
today.

KSEA...Clear skies with increasing elevated smoke. Could see some
slightly reduced surface visibilities, 6 or 7 sm, 12z-16z in haze as
well as slantwise visibility reductions today. Northerly winds 4
to 8 knots, indicating a turn back to the west to southwest after
06Z Sunday.

.MARINE...High pressure at the surface will continue to build over
the coastal waters with the thermally induced surface trough inland.
Light onshore flow will increase today as the thermal trough moves
east. Onshore flow pattern will continue over the next several days.
A weak low pressure system may move into the coastal waters Tuesday
into Wednesday for a chance of rain.

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridging remains nudged into the area
and an associated thermal trough at the surface continues to push
inland, keeping fire weather conditions critical today. Hot, dry,
and unstable conditions will continue through this evening for
the Olympic zones 652/661 and Cascade zones 658/659 - where a Red
Flag Warning remains in effect. While onshore flow has returned to
the coast, the marine layer has remained rather shallow and
confined to the coastline. Higher elevations within the Olympic
mountains still remain exposed to low RH values. There are a few
factors to monitor today. Increased smoke aloft may hamper
temperatures a bit, however dry and unstable conditions are
expected to persist. A few mid to high level clouds have also
started to move northward into the region this morning and may
bring some isolated chances of showers and thunderstorms - mainly
to the Cascades. However the low levels remain rather dry and QPF
remains rather light. Confidence in showers and thunderstorm
occurrence remains low as probabilistic guidance continues to show
less than a 10% chance.

Cooler and more moist air will return area-wide on Sunday with the
potential of some wetting rains by mid-week. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
