Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
913 PM PST Sun Feb 23 2025

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Front well east of the area this evening. Strong
pressure rises behind the front created gusty southwesterly winds,
mostly in the 20 to 30 mph range with gusts 40 to 45 mph. There
was a gust to 63 mph at Paine Field in Everett at 6 pm ( the gusts
were 44 mph at 555 pm and 38 mph at 605 pm ). The Olympia to
Bellingham gradient went from -0.7 millibars at 22z to plus 6.8
millibars at 02z. The gradients is already dropping, down to 5.0
millibars at 04z. Gusty winds continuing for the next few hours,
easing after midnight.

First look at the operational NAM and GFS still showing the
potential for strong winds tomorrow into Tuesday especially along
the coast. The low is weakening as it moves inland so while the
low track is favorable for high winds in the interior the
weakening low should take some of the sting out of the winds. Even
with the weakening low winds strong enough to have advisories up
for the interior from early Monday afternoon into early Tuesday
morning. High wind warning up for the coast for the same
timeframe. The long duration of the strong winds along the coast
make power outages almost certain. Current forecast in good shape
tonight. No further updates. Previous discussion below with
updated aviation, marine and hydrology sections. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...An atmospheric river pattern will maintain wet
conditions across western Washington into early this week, with
periods of moderate to heavy rain and strong winds. Conditions
are favored to dry out towards mid-week as high pressure develops,
with potential for more widespread precipitation next weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>We`re in the midst of
another AR event with more wet weather headed our way. Rivers are
still running high although mostly within or near Action Stage.
Only the Skokomish River in Mason County is above flood. With this
in mind, the Flood Watch was shortened in time and truncated off
by 18z Mon. By then most rivers will have crested.

Next up, the focus turns to the next Pacific storm system slated
to impact the region Monday and Monday night. This system will
bring a round of strong wind (coast) with windy conditions in the
interior. Meanwhile, snow levels will be lowering to around 4,000
ft with periods of heavy snow in the Cascades. Paradise, in
particular, could see 2 ft of new snow. Higher passes like White
Pass and Stevens Pass will also see accumulating snowfall with
overall less snow and impacts at Snoqualmie Pass. Snow will taper
down Tuesday night as onshore flow weakens.

In addition, this storm system will generate large swell which is
aimed for the WA coast - a High Surf Advisory is in effect.

A ridge brings a break in the pattern moving into Wednesday. The
air mass will remain mild with forecast highs in the upper 50s to
around 60. 33

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...A weak front splits as it
tries to move inland on Thursday (rainfall amounts are light with
just a few hundredths if anything). The ridge then rebuilds,
keeping the next system offshore through the end of the week. A
deeper trough brings more rain and mountain snow over the weekend.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>MVFR to VFR cigs persisting in the area in the wake of
the frontal system tonight. Southerly winds are still gusty
throughout western Washington, but will be tapering off in the next
several hours. With significant low-level moisture and weakening
winds, that may allow for ceilings to lower back to MVFR/IFR and for
reduced visibility in mist and fog Monday morning. MVFR conditions
will return tomorrow afternoon as another round of rain arrives.

Winds will ease overnight becoming light Monday morning. On Monday,
winds will begin as easterly, veering to south and increasing
throughout the day. Winds will peak Monday night.

KSEA...VFR cigs have returned in the wake of the front, but
southwesterly winds remain gusty with speeds up to 20 kt. These
gusts will be slowly tapering off tonight. Guidance is hinting a
period of VFR conditions overnight, which may allow low ceilings and
fog to develop early Monday morning (20-25% probability). At this
point, a SCT to BKN deck of 010 is possible between 12Z and 18Z.
MVFR conditions and rain will return to the terminal late Monday
morning as the next system approaches.

.MARINE...Unsettled marine conditions are expected to persist into
Monday and early Tuesday morning. East to southeast winds will
increase this afternoon into tonight and become southwesterly as a
frontal system traverses the area waters. As winds become
west/southwesterly tonight there looks to be a very brief push of
winds down the Strait of Juan de Fuca and into portions of the
Northern Inland Waters, as well as over northern Puget Sound that
could make for a short time period of marginal Small Craft Advisory
conditions. Winds will decrease tonight before increasing again on
Monday as a strong low pressure system enters the offshore waters.
Winds look to increase to high-end gale force across most of the
area waters, with the only exception being the Central Strait of
Juan de Fuca. Models have the low pressure center tracking closer to
the coast, making landfall over central Vancouver Island near Cape
Flattery. This displaces the strongest winds to the south towards
the southern Washington/Oregon waters. Gusts to storm force will be
most likely across the waters south of Point Grenville. Winds will
peak Monday night into early Tuesday morning and will slowly ease
through the day on Tuesday. Broad high pressure will develop in the
storm`s wake Tuesday into Wednesday and will persist through the
remainder of the week, allowing for a break in the active conditions.

Combines seas around 9 to 11 ft today will rapidly build Monday
night into early Tuesday. Seas will build to 20 to near 30 ft, with
the largest waves over the southern coastal waters. Waves will begin
to subside Tuesday into Wednesday, but will remain between 10-12 ft
through late in the week.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Only the Skokomish River is above flood stage this
evening. Rivers are cresting or will crest below flood stage over
most of the area this evening north of Thurston county. The
Chehalis River is still rising tonight. Steady rain is over for
the night with the next round of rain arriving Monday. This
precipitation is not expected to produce significant rises in
rivers. If trends continue this evening look for the flood watch
to be trimmed again with Snohomish, King and Pierce counties
possibly dropped from the watch.

There is an increase risk of landslides with the rain over the
weekend and more rain to come Monday. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
