Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
937 AM PDT Wed Jul 2 2025

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No changes to the overall forecast. Please see the
aviation section below for updates to that forecast.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Warm and dry conditions will continue through
Wednesday. A weak trough will move through the area into the end
of the week with increasing onshore flow and cooler
temperatures into the holiday weekend. Mild and drier conditions
look to return by early next week as zonal flow develops.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridging has
been continuing to shift eastward away from western Washington,
allowing a weak trough offshore to slowly approach our area.
Recent satellite imagery this morning shows marine stratus along
the coast attempting to creep into the Southwest Interior but
having a hard time doing so. Stratus will burn off later on in
the morning with a a more milder but dry day on tap, with
temperatures moderating to the mid to upper 70s across the
interior, and the low to mid 60s for areas along the coast with
mostly sunny skies.

The aforementioned weak trough will cross our region on Thursday
with enhanced onshore flow across the region and cooler
temperatures. High temperatures on Thursday will cool to the low
70s across the interior and mid 60s for areas by the water. There
may be a chance for a spotty rain shower or two across the coast
and in the Cascades, but most likely will remain dry.

The pattern remains the same heading into the Independence
Holiday, with morning clouds and general sunshine throughout the
day with temperatures hovering in the mid 70s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Ensembles agree on zonal
flow developing over western Washington, with continued mild
conditions throughout the weekend and into the first half of next
week. Morning clouds and afternoon sunshine will be the theme of
the weekend. Although this pattern generally can open the door
for a chance of showers mostly along the coast and the North
Cascades, it looks like the chance for precipitation is pretty
low at this point. Clusters are hinting at another high pressure
building over the area on Tuesday onward, which could signal
warmer and drier conditions returning back to the area, but the
exact details are uncertain at this time.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak upper level trough offshore moving inland will
dissipate tonight into Thursday. Southwesterly flow aloft. In
the lower levels onshore flow will continue into Thursday.

IFR stratus along the coast currently stalling over the lower
Chehalis Valley bucked the odds and made it into the central
Kitsap Peninsula briefly this morning with MVFR stratus pushing
east into King and Pierce Counties and southward along the I-5
corridor into Thurston and Mason Counties. As expected this has
begun to erode as the morning warms and will dissipate late
morning/early afternoon. MVFR stratus forming along the coast
tonight 03z-06z will move inland overnight getting just east of
Puget Sound for a few hours Thursday morning ( 13z-17z ).

KSEA...Stratus that did move into the the terminal this
morning has already begun to burn back to the west and south.
VFR conditions will persist through the afternoon and evening.
HREF ensemble showing some chance of MVFR stratus developing
late this eventing near the terminal into Thursday morning.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will remain in place across the coastal
and offshore waters this week with thermally induced low
pressure east of the Cascades. A weak front will dissipate over
the offshore waters Saturday.

Diurnal westerly pushes through the Strait of Juan de Fuca each
evening through the weekend. Small craft advisory tonight for the
Central and Eastern Strait, Friday evening looks to be the
strongest push after tonight with another round of small craft
advisory winds likely for the Central and Eastern Strait. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
