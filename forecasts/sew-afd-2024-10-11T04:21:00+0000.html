the area with an unfortunate patch of stratus block possible
aurora viewing from near Seattle-Tacoma east to North Bend and
north to near lake Stevens. Nothing new in first look at 00z
models. Current forecast has the trends covered. Previous
discussion follows with updated aviation section. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...Conditions will follow a warming and drying trend
through the weekend as an upper level ridge builds into the
Pacific Northwest. Troughing will move into the region on Monday
and beyond, bringing in chances for rain and cooler temperatures.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...Despite cloudy skies across
much of the lowlands this morning, conditions will continue to
improve this afternoon as high pressure aloft builds into the
region. While temperatures today will peak near or slightly below
normal in the 50s to low 60s, a warming and drying trend will
continue into the weekend with highs reaching 70 degrees across
much of the lowlands by Saturday. High clouds will persist tonight
and linger through Friday before weak offshore flow allows skies
to clear by Saturday.

By Sunday, the upper ridge axis will begin to shift eastward as a
longwave trough deepens along the Pacific Northwest coast. While
this will introduce more cloud cover across western Washington,
the best chance for rain showers will be along the coast, where
rainfall totals will be light. Sunday will be the last day of
above-normal temperatures through the period before a more fall-
like pattern settles into the region.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Models continue to show
good agreement over cooler and wetter conditions for much of next
week as a deep upper level low moves over the region. High
temperatures will dip into the 50s for most areas by Wednesday,
with long range ensembles even favoring below normal temperatures
through the end of next week. Precipitation will spread inland on
Monday, continuing through Thursday as troughing continues to dig
southward. Preliminary rainfall totals range from an inch across
the lowlands to up to 3 inches over the Olympics and Cascades.
Snow levels will drop to near 4000 ft by mid-week following the
cooling trend, with elevations above 4500 ft on track to see
several inches of snow accumulation.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge building over Western Washington
into Friday. Southwesterly flow aloft becoming southerly Friday.
Light flow in the lower levels.

Just some high clouds for most of the area overnight. Patch of
stratus with ceilings 1500-2500 feet over Seattle-Tacoma airport
extending northeast and east. This feature will remain overnight
into Friday morning and expand northward along the Puget Sound.
High clouds do not look thick enough at this point to prevent
patchy fog from forming over the Southwest Interior early Friday
morning. Stratus dissipating around 18z with fog dissipating a
little sooner leaving just some high clouds Friday afternoon.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings lowering to IFR early Friday morning. Clouds
scattering out around 18z with just some high clouds FRiday
afternoon. Light northerly winds 4 to 8 knots. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...Weak high pressure continues to shift inland this
afternoon, with winds out of the north over most waterways. A couple
gusts to 15 kt have been observed over the Puget Sound waters,
otherwise winds have generally remained out of the north/northeast
over the waters at 6 to 10 kt today.

The next frontal system will weaken well offshore on Friday. This
will likely keep the pattern partially offshore through this
weekend, with waves at 3 to 6 feet. A stronger cold front will move
through Monday, with rain and potential for gusty southerly winds in
the outer coastal waters Sunday and Monday. Seas will build back up
to 10 to 13 feet Sunday into Monday with this disturbance, dropping
back to 6 to 9 feet middle of next week.
