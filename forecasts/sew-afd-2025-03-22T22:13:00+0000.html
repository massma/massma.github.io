Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An atmospheric river will bring heavier precipitation,
increasing snow levels, and breezy winds Sunday into early Monday.
Drier weather on Tuesday with warm temperatures. A deep trough
offshore Wednesday will bring the potential of showers and
thunderstorms. A cooler pattern, with periods of precipitation,
expected Thursday and Friday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A brief break in the
precipitation for most areas this afternoon with increasing high
clouds ahead of an approaching warm front. The warm front will
move across Western Washington tonight into Sunday. This will
bring warming temperatures and increasing snow levels. Snow levels
will initially be around 3500 to 4500 feet at the onset of
precipitation, allowing for snowfall at Stevens Pass and higher
elevations. A Winter Weather Advisory has been issued for Stevens
Pass and North Cascades, with snowfall amounts ranging 5 to 11
inches into Sunday morning. By Sunday afternoon, snow levels will
be above 7000 feet for most areas. Precipitation will be heaviest
through Monday along the western slopes of the Olympics, as well
as the Cascades from King County northwards. QPF amounts in these
areas look to range 3 to 6 inches in 48 hours, with localized
amounts up to 8 inches possible. These amounts, combined with
high snow levels, will result in rising river levels across
Western Washington. Refer to the .HYDROLOGY section for additional
details on potential river flooding. In addition to the heavier
precipitation, south winds will increase in the warm sector on
Sunday. Wind gusts are expected to peak 20 to 40 MPH through
Sunday evening, with localized gusts of 45 MPH possible around
Admiralty Inlet, Everett and vicinity, as well as the south
Washington coast. HREF also highlights Admiralty Inlet near
Everett with probabilities around 30% for gusts of 50 MPH.
However, widespread gusts of 45 MPH are not expected at this time.

Precipitation will slowly taper off from south to north on Monday
as ridging begins to build northwards into Western Washington.
The ridge axis will then build further into the interior Pacific
Northwest on Tuesday, resulting in generally drier conditions, as
well as warming temperatures. This will likely be the warmest
temperatures so far this year, with highs on Tuesday in the 60s to
low 70s. Daily record temperatures (both max and min) may be
broken at a few locations, particularly SEA, OLM, and NWS Seattle.
Although there will still be clouds around, this will be a great
day to get outside across the area.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...A deep upper trough will
approach the Pacific Northwest on Wednesday. This is a rather
anomalous pattern for March, as this pattern supports increasing
southerly flow aloft with an impressive ridge over the interior
West. Instability will increase on Tuesday night into Wednesday
with the south flow. This is noted well on the ECMWF EFI, as the
12z EPS highlights very anomalous CAPE values for the midweek
timeframe across the Pacific Northwest. Although NBM probabilities
of thunder remain limited, pattern recognition suggests a decent
chance of convective showers or thunderstorms over the PacNW
around Wednesday. There remains some uncertainty into the position
of the trough midweek, however, so convection isn`t a slam dunk,
but the potential does exist. We will continue to monitor this
period for thunderstorm potential.

The aforementioned upper trough then moves over the PacNW
Thursday into Friday allowing for the return of cooler
temperatures, along with continued unsettled weather. Snow levels
will drop late week again, allowing for another round of mountain
snow, and lowland rain showers. Temperatures remain warm on
Wednesday with the ridge influence before cooling Thursday into
the weekend. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>VFR this afternoon with increasing mid level clouds
ahead of an incoming storm system. Surface winds generally south to
southwest 5-12 kt.

The next system will spread MVFR to IFR precipitation inland this
evening, with widespread precip continuing through early Monday
before shifting northward. Deteriorated conditions are expected
throughout the day Sunday with low ceilings persisting and pockets
of reduced visibility in/around stronger showers. Southerly winds
will increase throughout the morning Sunday becoming 10 to 20 kt by
the late morning with gusts peaking between 25-40 kt Sunday
afternoon. Rain and breezy winds will continue through Sunday
evening before decreasing and shifting northward into Monday.

KSEA...VFR this afternoon with S winds 8 to 12 kt. Winds will
decrease this evening before increasing Sunday morning as a warm
front lifts across the region. MVFR rain will move over the terminal
later this evening, but may be delayed, at least initially, due to
rain shadowing. Conditions will further deteriorate to IFR early
Sunday morning as rainfall increases and ceilings lower. IFR
conditions are favored to continue throughout the day Sunday as rain
continues. Southerly winds will increase throughout the morning
Sunday, becoming breezy after 12z with peak gusts occurring between
17z-01z as high as 35 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system will swing a warm front across the region
tonight into Sunday morning, bringing strong southerlies across
nearly all coastal and interior waters. Most of the region will see
SCA winds throughout much of the day Sunday with gusts to 30-35 kt,
with Gales over the southern most outer waters for gusts up to 40
kt. Another warm front will lift across area waters Monday before
high pressure rebounds late Monday into Tuesday for calmer
conditions. Another frontal system will enter the region Wednesday
for another round of both elevated winds and seas.

Combined seas hovering around 8 to 11 feet will remain elevated
through the weekend before subsiding below 10 feet early next week.
Another system will generate elevated seas mid-week, bringing
combined seas as high as 12 to 16 feet towards the end of the week.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Precipitation will increase tonight with heavier rain
continuing into Monday. Snow levels quickly rising to at least
7000 feet on Sunday. Due the combination of heavier precipitation,
and rising snow levels, rivers across Western Washington will
begin to rise on Sunday. At this time, the Skokomish River in
Mason County is forecast to exceed flood stage Sunday night, and
crest in Moderate flood stage on Monday. QPF amounts have
increased in this latest forecast, which also allows for a higher
rise on other rivers as well during this period, particularly
rivers off the west slopes of the Olympics, and across King,
Skagit, and Snohomish Counties. All rivers will continue to be
monitored during this period. Drier weather is expected Monday
night through Tuesday. Another round of heavier showers are
expected on Wednesday, with a cooler weather pattern late week.
