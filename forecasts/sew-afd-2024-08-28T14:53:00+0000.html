Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
753 AM PDT Wed Aug 28 2024

.SYNOPSIS...An upper-ridge is taking hold and will remain in
place into the weekend. Here, we can expect the return of more
summer-like conditions. Then, a transient trough will reintroduce
PoPs into the forecast early next week along with a cool down in
temperatures.

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Quiet and cool morning across western Washington with
areas of patchy fog in the Chehalis and Snohomish river valleys.
Temperatures this morning were a couple degrees cooler than
forecast but highs are still expected to rise into the upper 60s
to low 70s. Minor adjustments were made to the temperature and fog
forecasts through this morning. Otherwise the forecast is in good
shape and no additional updates are planned. -Wolcott-<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Good morning, western
Washington. Current 3 AM temperatures across a few locations here
in our CWA: Olympia 46 F, Hoquiam 48 F, Renton 54 F.

We`re on the backside of an upper-trough here this morning with
northwesterly flow aloft. The 500mb pattern is showing signs of
progress as an upper-ridge looms offshore. Its axis has pushed
well into BC and should become more aligned over the PNW tonight
into Thursday morning. Currently, mostly clear skies as dry
northerly flow is overhead. The lack of cloud coverage, residual
surface moisture from recent precip, and light winds are leading
to patchy fog development. However, any lingering fog should burn
off readily as diurnal mixing kicks. Today`s temperatures will be
a few degrees warmer compared to yesterday`s with highs in the mid
60s to mid 70s. Widespread dry weather is also in the forecast
and as alluded too will be the general theme through the next
several days. Overnight lows are to fall into the mid 40s to lower
50s.

The transient ridge off the Pacific that`s bringing drier
conditions will be positioned over the Canadian Prairies by
Thursday. But for this time of the year, influence from the all
too common Great Basin ridge will replace it. Large scale
subsidence along with light offshore flow will warm temperatures
back into the mid 70s to mid 80s. Coastal spots are to stay a bit
cooler with highs in the mid 60s to lower 70s. By Friday, the
ridge axis will stretch across Washington as temperatures trend
warmer. 80s are looking to become more widespread in the interior
with with a 40-50% chance of 90s for Cascade valley locations like
Packwood amd Randle given latest NBM probabilities. Minor to
moderate HeatRisk must be noted for Friday but some reprieve will
be felt overnight as lows fall into the 50s.


.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Above average temperatures
will peak over the weekend. Then, marine cooled air will make a
comeback on Monday along with the probability of precipitation. An
approaching trough will perturb the environment as the pattern
flips. With preexisting warm temperatures, instability won`t be
hard to achieve as the cool upper-low settles overhead. Will have
to monitor the potential for thunderstorms into the beginning of
next week but as of now uncertainty remains.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge centered offshore will continue
to build into Western Washington today with northwest flow aloft.
Low level onshore flow will weaken and turn more northerly in
response to thermally induced low pressure expanding northward
along the Oregon coast. Areas of IFR or low MVFR in stratus across
mainly south Puget Sound, the Southwest Interior, and coastal
areas will scatter out by late morning for VFR areawide this
afternoon and evening.

KSEA...Expecting VFR conditions today with some patchy stratus
mainly south and west of the terminal this morning. Surface winds
light E/SE will become northerly 8 to 12 knots after 18Z.

.MARINE...Onshore flow will relax today as broad surface ridging
rebuilds over the offshore and coastal waters. Thermally induced low
pressure will then expand northward along the Oregon and Washington
coast Thursday through Saturday, turning the flow northerly. Winds
are expected to remain generally under advisory levels across area
waters with the exception of perhaps the southern outer coastal
waters.   27
