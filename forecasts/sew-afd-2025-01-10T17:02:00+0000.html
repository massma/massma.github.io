Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
902 AM PST Fri Jan 10 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough will continue to push into the
Pacific Northwest today, bringing in breezy winds alongside
lowland rain and mountain snow. Convergence zone showers will set up
over the central Cascades tonight, with continued lowland showers
lingering through the weekend under moist northwest flow. Drier
conditions are forecast to return next week as high pressure
rebuilds over the western US.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Current radar showing frontal
system already on its way out of the CWA this morning, with points
west of Puget Sound already starting to dry out...even though some
low clouds and scattered showers here and there do linger. Even the
immediate east side of the sound is starting to see activity taper
off at the time of this writing. That leaves the majority of the
remainder of the precip over the Cascades, as per inherited
forecast. That said, echoes do continue to favor the Central
Cascades...but will need the front to push a little further eastward
before how much involvement/development any PSCZ has or will have.
That said, inherited Winter Weather Advisory there looks to be on
track.

Strong ridging building over the Pacific clearly displays what is to
come, but W WA will not get there yet. A series of weak impulses
along the leading edge of this ridge will still keep the prospect
for scattered showers over the area for Saturday and Sunday. PoPs
Saturday tend to favor the southern third of the CWA as well as from
the East Puget Sound Lowlands through the foothills and into the
Cascades proper...but even then remain only 30-50 pct...with
generally dry conditions expected elsewhere /maybe a 10-20 pct
chance at worst/. Sunday is even less convincing, with at best a 20
pct chance for showers.

Highs today will prove to be the warmest of the short term with most
spots reaching the upper 40s to lower 50s. In the wake of the
passing front, daytime temps do take a little bit of a hit, only
getting into the lower to mid 40s for each day of the weekend.

Inherited forecast is on track and see no need for any morning
updates at this time.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...From Previous
Discussion...Long range models continue to favor high pressure
building over western Washington through much of next week, allowing
for drier and warmer conditions. Weak forcing and residual moisture
will likely allow for rounds of low stratus and patchy fog around
the Puget Sound lowlands early Monday and Tuesday mornings with
mostly sunny skies returning each afternoon. The ridge is favored to
break down towards the end of next week as moist zonal flow returns,
but significant impacts are not expected with this pattern change.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Front has moved through Western Washington and rain
should taper off behind it pretty quickly. Expecting it to remain
dry for the majority of the terminals. Post frontal onshore flow
this afternoon and tonight with convergence zone over Snohomish and
King County. Westerly flow aloft becoming northwesterly this
afternoon as post frontal upper level trough moves through Western
Washington.

A mixed bag of ceilings with some light rain passing through the
terminals. Some light isolated showers still possible behind the
front. MVFR is likely to persist into the afternoon hours. Improving
trend after 02z with VFR ceilings possible for a few hours (low
confidence at this time) until the ceilings lower back down to MVFR
after 09z.

KSEA...Ceilings looking to remain MVFR through the afternoon.
Improving trend after 00z with VFR ceilings is possible. However,
looking at recent guidance, it is possible ceilings will remain MVFR
throughout the day. Thus, not too confident on improvement at this
time as some of the high-resolution guidance points at the
convergence zone moving southward to SEA around 18-21Z. Confidence
is also low on how south the convergence zone will shift. If the
convergence zone does move into the terminal, expect a brief
transition to northerly winds. Felton/MGF<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system will move through the waters
this morning, bringing increased winds and seas. Broad surface
ridging will rebuild offshore this afternoon into tonight. This
ridge will expand into area waters over the weekend for a relatively
quiet period into early next week.

Post frontal gales in the Strait of Juan de Fuca beginning late this
morning and continuing into the evening hours. Small craft advisory
winds for the remainder of the waters except the Puget Sound into
tonight. Small craft advisory conditions continuing over the Coastal
Waters into Saturday night.

Seas building to 12 to 16 ft today subsiding under 10 ft Sunday.
