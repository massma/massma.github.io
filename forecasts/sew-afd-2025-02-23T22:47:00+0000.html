Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
247 PM PST Sun Feb 23 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An atmospheric river pattern will maintain wet
conditions across western Washington into early this week, with
periods of moderate to heavy rain and strong winds. Conditions
are favored to dry out towards mid-week as high pressure develops,
with potential for more widespread precipitation next weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>We`re in the midst of
another AR event with more wet weather headed our way. The bulk of
the heavier precipitation (and higher IVT) is south of the CWA but
we`re still looking at another 0.5-1.50" across the area through
tonight. Rivers are still running high although mostly within or
near Action Stage. Only the Skokomish River in Mason County is
above flood. With this in mind, the Flood Watch was shortened in
time and truncated off by 18z Mon. By then most rivers will have
crested.

Next up, the focus turns to the next Pacific storm system slated
to impact the region Monday and Monday night. This system will
bring a round of strong wind (coast) with windy conditions in the
interior. Meanwhile, snow levels will be lowering to around 4,000
ft with periods of heavy snow in the Cascades. Paradise, in
particular, could see 2 ft of new snow. Higher passes like White
Pass and Stevens Pass will also see accumulating snowfall with
overall less snow and impacts at Snoqualmie Pass. Snow will taper
down Tuesday night as onshore flow weakens.

In addition, this storm system will generate large swell which is
aimed for the WA coast - a High Surf Advisory is in effect.

A ridge brings a break in the pattern moving into Wednesday. The
air mass will remain mild with forecast highs in the upper 50s to
around 60. 33

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...A weak front splits as it
tries to move inland on Thursday (rainfall amounts are light with
just a few hundredths if anything). The ridge then rebuilds,
keeping the next system offshore through the end of the week. A
deeper trough brings more rain and mountain snow over the weekend.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>MVFR to IFR conditions prevail across western Washington
as rain spreads over the region. Expect these conditions to persist
into early this evening as this system moves through. Models are
showing a brief return to VFR conditions behind the front by around
06Z Monday. With significant low-level moisture and weakening winds,
that may allow for ceilings to lower back to MVFR/IFR and for
reduced visibility in mist and fog Monday morning. MVFR conditions
will return tomorrow afternoon as another round of rain arrives.

South winds will veer to southwesterly tonight and increase,
reaching 10 to 20 kt with gusts 25 to 35 kt by this evening. The
strongest winds will be along the coastal terminals. Winds will ease
overnight becoming light Monday morning. On Monday, winds will begin
as easterly, veering to south and increasing throughout the day.
Winds will peak Monday night.

KSEA...MVFR cigs continue this afternoon with rain as the next
system moves through the area this afternoon. Rain may be heavy at
times, causing reductions in vis and could produce periods of IFR to
LIFR conditions. Guidance is hinting a period of VFR conditions
overnight, which may allow low ceilings and fog to develop early
Monday morning (20-25% probability). MVFR conditions and rain will
return to the terminal late Monday morning as the next system
approaches.

South to southwesterly winds will increase this afternoon, peaking
this evening at 10 to 15 kt with gusts up to 20 to 25 kt. Winds will
slowly decrease overnight becoming light by Monday morning. Winds
will resume as easterly Monday and slowly veer to south and increase
throughout the day.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Unsettled marine conditions are expected to persist into
Monday and early Tuesday morning. East to southeast winds will
increase this afternoon into tonight and become southwesterly as a
frontal system traverses the area waters. As winds become
west/southwesterly tonight there looks to be a very brief push of
winds down the Strait of Juan de Fuca and into portions of the
Northern Inland Waters, as well as over northern Puget Sound that
could make for a short time period of marginal Small Craft Advisory
conditions. Winds will decrease tonight before increasing again on
Monday as a strong low pressure system enters the offshore waters.
Winds look to increase to high-end gale force across most of the
area waters, with the only exception being the Central Strait of
Juan de Fuca. Models have the low pressure center tracking closer to
the coast, making landfall over central Vancouver Island near Cape
Flattery. This displaces the strongest winds to the south towards
the southern Washington/Oregon waters. Gusts to storm force will be
most likely across the waters south of Point Grenville. Winds will
peak Monday night into early Tuesday morning and will slowly ease
through the day on Tuesday. Broad high pressure will develop in the
storm`s wake Tuesday into Wednesday and will persist through the
remainder of the week, allowing for a break in the active conditions.

Combines seas around 9 to 11 ft today will rapidly build Monday
night into early Tuesday. Seas will build to 20 to near 30 ft, with
the largest waves over the southern coastal waters. Waves will begin
to subside Tuesday into Wednesday, but will remain between 10-12 ft
through late in the week.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Most rivers have crested this afternoon from rain that
fell Friday and Saturday. Rivers that are still rising are expected
to slow down and crest below any flood stage. A limited amount of
QPF Sunday afternoon into Monday morning (0.5-1.5 inches over
pockets of the Cascades/Olympics with snow levels at 4,000 feet) may
slow down the falling of rivers, but is not expected to contribute
to any additional rises in rivers (exception being the Skokomish,
which will likely remain above flood stage through the middle of the
week - will continue the flood warning). The Stillaguamish River has
also fallen below flood stage this afternoon, and will not plan on
extending the flood warning for this river. Precipitation Monday
into Tuesday is not expected to produce significant rises in rivers
(due to snow levels at 4,000 feet). Thus the flood watch was
shortened to end at noon Monday based on these factors. The threat
for additional river rises will continue to be monitored (as well as
the possibility of an increased landslide risk).
