Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
252 AM PDT Sun May 4 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A warmer and drier trend will commence today and
persist through the first half of the week as upper level ridging
builds back into the area. Chances of showers will increase near
midweek as the ridge axis moves further inland and a weak system
approaches western Washington. Drier conditions return with near
to slightly above normal temperatures late in the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough over
the region will continue to move off to the east this morning,
allowing for a ridge of high pressure to build back into the area
today. This will mark the start of a warming and drying trend for
western Washington through the first part of the week. Some
lingering cloud cover is expected across the region this morning,
but expect clouds to scatter throughout the day for more sun by
the afternoon. Afternoon high temperatures today will climb a few
degrees from Saturday`s highs, and top out in the upper 50s to
mid 60s for much of the area.

The ridge of high pressure will remain the dominant influence over
the region Monday and Tuesday, keeping conditions warm and dry
across the area. High temperatures will warm a few degrees each
day, with highs on Monday expected to climb into the low to mid
60s for areas along the coast and into the mid 60s to low 70s for
areas across the interior. This warmup will reintroduce Minor
(Yellow) HeatRisk values to portions of the interior lowlands-
which highlights impacts to individuals that are extremely
sensitive to heat, especially when outdoors without effective
cooling and/or adequate hydration. Tuesday continues to look like
the warmest day of the week, with highs expected to be in the 70s
across the lowlands and in the mid 60s to low 70s along the
coast. A few spots, specifically south of the Sound and in the
Cascade valleys, may even approach 80. This will result in Minor
HeatRisk becoming more widespread across the lowlands.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Both deterministic
guidance and ensembles are in good agreement that the upper level
ridge will start to shift further inland towards the central U.S.
on Wednesday. This will allow for troughing to redevelop over the
northeastern Pacific and for a weak system to approach western
Washington. At this time, the bulk of the moisture associated
with this system looks to move into British Columbia, however,
expect increased shower chances for the region as the system
brushes the area. Expect any precipitation to be rather light,
with most areas expected to only see a few hundredths of an inch.

Lingering showers will persist into Thursday, but generally
expect another drying trend to commence Thursday into the weekend
as ensembles show a ridge of high pressure amplifying over the
interior West. Temperatures will trend close to slightly above
normal late in the week as a result- and will generally be in the
60s to low 70s across the interior and upper 50s to 60s for areas
along the coast. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Calm to light northerly flow across all terminals early
this morning. Isolated IFR conditions are present across the Kitsap
peninsula as some mist develops. Elsewhere, VFR cigs are expected
throughout the rest of the day. Surface wind speeds will range
between 5 to 10 kts, with some gusts to 20 kts possible along the
Strait of Juan de Fuca and the coast in the afternoon and evening.

KSEA...VFR early this morning and expected for the rest of the TAF
period, with northeasterly flow at 5 to 7 kts. Surface winds will
become northerly around 16Z and persist at 5 to 7 kts until around
21Z, where they will increase in speed to 9 to 11 kts. A return to
northeasterly flow expected after 06Z.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light onshore flow continues today as high pressure
remains over the northeast Pacific. Seas are expected to be between
4 and 6 feet over the coastal waters today, with generally calm
conditions expected through the middle of the week. A frontal system
arriving midweek could raise seas to 6 to 8 feet with breezier
conditions. Westerly pushes down the Strait of Juan de Fuca are
expected to be weaker over the next few days and not worthy of
headlines.
