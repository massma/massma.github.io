Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
252 AM PDT Sun Oct 27 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front is currently moving through the area,
bringing heavy rain. Behind the front, unstable conditions will
allow for showers to continue with a chance of thunderstorms
during the day, as well as breezy winds. Snow levels will fall low
enough for mountain snow above 4000 ft. A brief break is possible
late Monday and part of Tuesday before another system looks to
bring another round of rain, breezy winds, and mountain snow mid-
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A low pressure system
currently centered near Haida Gwaii will slowly move southeastward
towards western Washington along the British Columbia coast, with
several fronts/surface troughs that will maintain active weather
today and into Monday. The main cold front will pass through the
area early this morning, bringing with it a band of moderate rain.
Behind the front, expect a more convective mode with scattered
showers and isolated thunderstorms. Best chances for thunderstorms
will be over the coastal waters and Pacific Coast (20-30%).
Lightning will be the primary impact, but some small graupel/hail
and heavy downpours cannot be ruled out in any storms that develop.
Behind the front, snow levels will drop to around 4500 ft tomorrow,
reaching 4000 ft Monday. The heaviest mountain snow will be in the
North Cascades, including the Mt. Baker ski area. Additionally, the
higher elevation mountain passes above 4500, including Washington
Pass, will see several inches of snow accumulation tonight into
early tomorrow. A rain/snow mix may begin in the high-elevation
passes as early as this morning. Additionally, winds will remain
breezy through the day and into Monday, but look to remain under
advisory thresholds.

Precipitation chances and breezy winds will begin to cease Monday
night as the low pressure system continues to fill in and move south
out of the region. A weak surface ridge will try and push into the
region Tuesday, but another strong cold front is on its heels.

With the wet pattern through the short term, temperatures will not
waver much each day. There will be a slight cooling trend, with
highs in the mid 50s and lows in the 40s.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Models are in good
agreement that a substantial low pressure system will push
southeastward towards the area, pushing a cold front across the area
on Wednesday. There looks to be slightly less moisture with this
system, but with snow levels falling to 3000 to 3500 ft, the
mountains will see good chances for accumulating snow, including the
passes. Chances for rain and snow continue through late week, with
the associated upper-level trough slowly moving through the region.
Models are beginning to hint at the potential for ridging develop
over the east Pacific and follow this system, which could indicate a
trend towards drier and slightly warmer conditions next weekend.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft will gradually become more
westerly through the day as an upper level low over the NE
Pacific sinks southeastward along British Columbia. At the
surface, a frontal system moving across western WA will bring
breezy southerly winds for the majority of the area terminals
through the day. Widespread rain is currently moving into the
interior this morning, bringing a mix of conditions to the area.
Conditions are generally MVFR to IFR in heavier rain. Widespread
rain will transition to scattered showers through the morning
hours as the front pushes off to the east. Isolated thunderstorms
will be possible throughout the day, however confidence remains
too low at this time for inclusion in the TAFs. Ceilings are
generally expected to improve through the morning and hover
between MVFR and low-end VFR this afternoon and evening, though
can expect brief reductions to ceilings and visibilities in any
heavier showers or thunderstorms.

KSEA...Rain at the terminal transitioning to showers this morning.
Ceilings will generally hover between the 2000-4000 ft range through
the morning hours, before improving towards 3500-5000 this afternoon.
Brief reductions to IFR ceilings and visibilities will be possible
in heavier rain through the day. Southerly winds 5-10 kt will
increase to 10-14 kt this morning and will remain breezy through
the day. Gusts to 20-25 kt will be possible through the day. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system moving across the area today will
bring breezy southerly winds to the coastal waters and portions of
the interior waters through much of the day today, with hi-res
guidance showing gusts to 25-30 kt likely. Isolated thunderstorms
will be possible across the area waters through the day and may
bring erratic winds, reduced visibilities, and lightning to
portions of the waters today.

The pattern will generally remain active as a strong low pressure
system sinks southward from the Gulf of Alaska and into the region
on Monday before pushing inland Monday night into Tuesday. High
pressure then looks to build back into the coastal waters on Tuesday
before another strong frontal system moves into the area waters
on Wednesday. A low over the Gulf of Alaska then looks to sink
southward into the region on Thursday, keeping conditions active
across the waters.

Seas are currently hovering between 8-11 ft early this morning
will build towards 16-18 ft today. Seas will gradually subside
through Sunday, but look to stay above 10 ft through Monday. Seas
may briefly fall below 10 ft under the influence of higher pressure
on Tuesday, however expect this to remain short-lived as the
strong frontal system moving into the region midweek allows for
seas to build above 10 ft again. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Several systems will track across western Washington,
with periods of showers today into Monday, as well as another system
mid-week. Snow levels will slowly lower from 5000 ft early Sunday to
below 4000 ft on Monday. With an additional 1 to 3 inches of rain in
the forecast across the Olympic and Cascade mountains through
Monday, rises are expected on area rivers. Wednesday`s front may
bring another round of 1 to 3 inches over the Olympics, through snow
levels will be lower (around 3000 to 3500 ft). Currently no rivers
are forecasted to reach flood stage, but rivers will need to be
monitored, in particular the Skokomish, which is forecasted to
approach Action stage on Monday and again late this week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
