Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
315 AM EDT Sun Sep 15 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure across the Northeast remains through Monday. A frontal
system then slowly approaches from the southwest through mid-week
and remains in the vicinity through the end of next week. A back
door cold front moves through late next week into the first half of
next weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Large dome of high pressure will reside across the area on Sunday
with easterly flow and temperatures at or just below normal. Highs
will be in the mid-70s to near 80, with the warmest temperatures
just west of the NYC metro in NJ. Full sunshine is expected with a
light easterly flow to start before southeasterly coastal sea
breezes.

With light winds tonight and mostly clear skies, optimal radiational
cooling conditions are expected with lows in the 50s for most.
However, some interior areas and the LI Pine Barrens could drop into
the upper-40s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A developing low along the Carolina coast is forecast to track well
south of the area on Monday and Tuesday. NHC is monitoring this area
for potential tropical development. An inverted surface trough may
develop along this low, extended into our area on TUesday. This
along with gradually increasing moisture could lead to an isolated
shower or two in the afternoon on Tuesday. It will also lead to
increased cloud cover, which will begin to increase south to north
on Monday, sticking around on Tuesday.

Highs will be the mid-70s Monday and Tuesday. Monday night will
still be somewhat cool in the low-50s to low-60s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The long term period starts off with an area of low pressure over
the Carolinas. This low will slowly move northwestward toward the
Ohio Valley through mid-week. An associated frontal system will
approach from the southwest and will begin to impact the region
mainly Tuesday night into Wednesday.

The low and frontal system get caught under the upper level ridging
over the eastern US from mid to late week and a prolonged period of
unsettled weather is possible as weak flow under the ridge will mean
slow movement of these features. Right now, it looks like the most
likely period of rain is Tuesday night through Thursday, especially
if the 00z ECMWF/Canadian pans out. The 00z GFS/NAM have backed off
on this idea and keeps the area mostly dry during this period. There
is a low chance right now of flooding, and the Weather Prediction
Center has place much of the forecast area in a marginal risk of
excessive rainfall Wednesday into Thursday. There is a great deal of
uncertainty and the forecast is likely to change over the next few
days. Due to uncertainty, stuck close to the NBM/CONSALL through the
long term.

Thereafter, the system finally begins to nudge south and east with
the approach of a back door cold front that moves through Friday
night. High pressure builds in from the northeast on Saturday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /07Z SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will remain centered to the north and east.

VFR for most terminals to start, however IFR ceilings are expected
to move in from the east/northeast to the west/southwest. There are
timing uncertainties with KBDR and KISP forecast to lower between
08Z-09Z and and possibly into KLGA and KJFK around 10Z. Less certain
is IFR ceilings moving into KEWR and KTEB before sunrise, and with
less confidence have left IFR out at this time. KGON has already
lowered to IFR. Conditions improve back to VFR early Sunday morning.

Light SE to E winds become generally light and variable to light
E/NE tonight. Light flow increases to 5-10 kt Sunday morning,
becoming SE mid to late afternoon.


 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

There is a chance of IFR ceilings for a couple of hours at KLGA
and KJFK, 10Z to 12Z, and less certain at KEWR and KTEB.
Amendments possible.

OUTLOOK FOR 06Z MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...

Sunday night through Tuesday: Chance of MVFR or lower cond with
low clouds/fog each late night/early morning, otherwise VFR.

Wednesday and Thursday: Chance of showers with MVFR or lower cond
possible.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will remain north and east of the waters through
Monday, weakening on Tuesday. The easterly flow increases to
10-15kt on the ocean waters for Sunday through Tuesday with a
few gusts possibly approaching 20 kt. This will allow for seas
to slowly build with the potential for SCA seas around 5 ft
moving into the waters Monday afternoon, especially west of Fire
Island Inlet. However, for now have capped waves at 4 feet.

For now, expecting Sub-advisory conditions are in the forecast
through Thursday. However, an extended period of easterly flow over
the ocean waters may allow seas to build to near 5 ft Tuesday night
through Thursday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An extended period of rain is possible from Tuesday night through
Thursday. There is a great deal of uncertainty this far out. The
Weather Prediction Center has placed much of the forecast area
in marginal risk for excessive rainfall. One factor against
flooding would be the antecedent dry conditions over the last
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>With an approaching full moon on the 17th, astronomical high
tides will be rising leading up to that date and continuing into
much of next week. Continuous easterly flow will help build
seas and allow for some piling of water. Winds are expected to
remain generally light, near 10 kt or less. While some of the
guidance is showing water levels increasing, there is general
consensus of keeping them below minor coastal flooding
benchmarks. However, this will likely depend on the development
of low pressure off the Carolina coast early next week.

There is a moderate risk of rip current development at the
ocean beaches Sunday and Monday with an easterly flow
developing.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
