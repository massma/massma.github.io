Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
243 PM PDT Tue Apr 30 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Shower activity will taper off overnight with
unusually cool temperatures and areas of frost by Wednesday
morning. Another weak system will slide to our south on late
Wednesday into early Thursday. Drier and slightly warmer
conditions are expected Thursday and Friday before more
precipitation arrives late Friday and Saturday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A low pressure system
continues to progress east near Portland this afternoon. Isolated
to scattered showers continue to wrap around this system and will
gradually taper off through this evening. A stray thunderstorm or
two still cannot be ruled out this afternoon, with the highest
chances closer to Portland. Clearing skies and a cooler airmass
will result in areas with temperatures reaching into the low to
mid 30s tonight allowing for areas of frost development. A Frost
Advisory remains in effect for tonight.

A weak system will slide mainly south of the area late Wednesday
into early Thursday bringing another window of possible shower
activity, mainly south and west of Seattle. This will be followed
by transient ridging Thursday into early Friday allowing
temperatures to warm into the 60s Thursday and Friday. The next
system will begin to spread precipitation across the area Friday
afternoon and evening.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...A broad upper level low
will make its way to the coast Friday night. Cluster analysis
continues to indicate disagreement in the evolution of this low.
Roughly half of the members take the bulk of the low and
associated precipitation to the south while the other half keep a
more progressive pattern moving the system across Washington
fairly quickly but with heavier rainfall. In either case, the
system will be associated with at least some precipitation and wet
conditions are likely late Friday through Saturday.

Beyond the early weekend system, zonal flow and at least semi-
active weather is expected to continue. This will keep
temperatures in check and a chance of precipitation in the
forecast.
