Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
239 PM PST Sat Jan 18 2025

.SYNOPSIS...High pressure will dominate the weather into the
middle of next week, bringing dry conditions and colder
temperatures. Overnight lows are expected to fall below freezing
over much of Western Washington this weekend and into next week.


&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mostly clear skies across
W WA as lingering fog/low clouds have since faded. As scheduled,
upper-ridging is in place offshore leaving W WA under dry
northwesterly flow aloft. This feature will be the main event
throughout the short-term period along with below average
temperatures. For tonight, dry and cold weather is favored with
widespread 20s in the forecast. Sunday`s weather is likely a
carbon copy of Saturday`s as we`ll wake up to cold, frosty
conditions with areas of fog (mostly along river valleys and the
vicinity of the sound). We`ll warm up into the lower 40s across
the CWA as sunny skies prevail but still well-below average for
daytime highs for mid-January.

Monday`s weather will again, be mostly a carbon copy of this
weekend`s but the upper-level pattern is showing signs of
progression. The coldest temperatures are likely to peak Monday
morning but only by a degree or two compared to Sunday`s. The
ridge axis is crossing the PNW by Monday afternoon as a shortwave
trough and weak front is hot on its heels. Increasing cloud
coverage may bump temperatures up by a few degrees for Monday
night but cold conditions are likely to remain. Models aren`t too
impressed with the shortwave trough as precip chances remain next
to none for Tuesday.



.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Another round of ridging
is in the cards for Wednesday and into Thursday. But much
uncertainty exists on the evolution of the upper-level pattern
going into the weekend as models disagree. Regardless, the NBM
has latched on to this uncertainty and has introduced PoPs, albeit
weak ones, starting Wednesday and carrying through the second
half of the new week. Below normal temperatures are favored for
much of the long term.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level high pressure remains offshore with
continued northwest flow across the region. Some lingering patches
of fog continue, especially in the southern parts of the area, but
generally clear skies across the region this afternoon with a few
cumulus clouds over the mountains. Northerly surface winds around 5-
8 kt continue this evening, easing overnight. Expect another round
of fog to develop across much of the interior late tonight/early
Sunday with a low but shallow layer of fog under the building high
pressure. Winds will increase this morning from the north, and
become 6-8 kt through the interior. Weak outflow may maintain local
gusty winds to 20 kt around KBLI this morning. Expect mostly clear
skies this afternoon, but another round of fog is expected for many
terminals early Sunday morning.

KSEA...VFR conditions expected today with variable but decreasing
high clouds. North or northeast winds continue at around 6 to 8 kt,
easing overnight. Expect increased potential for a few hours of
shallow fog/freezing fog redeveloping between 09 and 13z Sunday with
a return to mostly clear skies and north surface winds resuming late
Sunday morning through the day. Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure remains offshore and will build over the
waters through the weekend. The offshore winds will continue, but
with a weaker gradient today expect winds to east a bit. The
offshore gradient increases again Sunday with some gusts around 20
kt possible over the northern inland waters with increased outflow
from the Fraser, along with gusty offshore wind over portions of the
coastal waters and Strait of Juan de Fuca. Will hold off on any
advisory issuance with gusts mostly in the 15-20 kt range. A frontal
system looks to approach the region on Tuesday and dissipate just
offshore Vancouver Island, bringing no significant impact to the
area waters. High pressure will then rebuild into the coastal waters
around midweek for another round of offshore flow. A more
significant frontal system may approach by Friday. Seas generally
hold around 6 to 8 feet through the early part of the week, but will
remain mixed through the weekend as a longer period wave group
interacts with a shorter period wave group. Seas then subside to
around 4 ft toward midweek, before again building late in the week
with the stronger disturbance.    Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
