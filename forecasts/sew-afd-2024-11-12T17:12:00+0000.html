Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
912 AM PST Tue Nov 12 2024

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Scattered showers will continue to stream inland this
morning and afternoon ahead of an incoming storm system. An
atmospheric river will develop this afternoon and evening, with
precipitation spreading across western Washington tonight.
Confidence is high over breezy to locally strong winds through
Wednesday morning, alongside river flooding for the Skokomish
River. Additional concerns continue to be monitored, including the
potential for convection and waterspouts along the coast on
Wednesday, additional river flooding, heavy snowfall over the
North Cascades, and tidal flooding along the coast. No updates to
the forecast this morning.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...Post frontal showers will continue through the morning
and afternoon hours today. A strong weather system will move into
western Washington this afternoon and evening, bringing another
round of widespread precipitation and gusty winds to the region.
Unsettled conditions from this system will persist into Thursday,
though conditions look to remain cool and unsettled through much
of the remainder of the week under a general troughing pattern.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Post frontal shower
activity will continue through the morning and afternoon hours
today. Snow showers will continue for portions of the North Cascades
above 4000 feet, where a winter weather advisory remains in
effect. A high surf advisory is also now in effect for areas along
the Pacific Coast through this afternoon.

A strong system will move into western Washington this afternoon
and evening, bringing another round of lowland rain, mountain
snow, and gusty winds to the area. Moderate to heavy rain will
spread inland this afternoon and evening, with the bulk of the
moisture centered over the Olympics and Cascades. The upper level
low will cycle offshore through Wednesday, before the trough axis
moves inland Thursday. This will continue to promote unsettled
conditions across western Washington into Thursday. Additional
hazards with this system include the potential for coastal
flooding, isolated river flooding, and thunderstorms. Details on
hazards have been outlined below:

WIND: Wind will increase across the area this afternoon and
evening, with widespread gusts to 35 to 45 mph possible. The
strongest winds will be along the coast and for areas north of
Everett, where gusts to 55 mph will be possible. Winds will
gradually ease through Wednesday morning.

MOUNTAIN SNOW: Snow levels will generally hover between 4000-5500
ft across the mountains, with heavy snow possible for portions of
the North Cascades through Thursday. A winter storm watch has
been issued this evening through Thursday for snow accumulations
of 12-24 inches possible for the higher elevations of the North
Cascades.

THUNDERSTORMS: Chances of thunderstorms remain possible in the
forecast through Wednesday, especially along the coast. Gusty
winds, small hail, brief heavy downpours, and lightning will be
possible in any storms that do develop.

HIGH SURF: Large waves along the coast may persist into Wednesday
before subsiding. Beachgoers should avoid walking on area beaches
and jetties as large waves may run further up area beaches and
could carry debris.

RIVER FLOODING: Expect rises on area rivers to continue with
additional lowland rain moving across the region. At this time,
flooding on the Skokomish River remains possible, while other
rivers will continue to be monitored. For more info, see the
hydrology section below.

COASTAL FLOODING: Minor tidal overflow will be possible along
shorelines and low-lying coastal areas Wednesday and Thursday, so
the potential for coastal flooding impacts will continue to be
monitored.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...General troughing over the
region will keep conditions wet and unsettled through much of
the weekend. Guidance does hint at a short-lived break in the
pattern on Friday, before the next system moves inland over the
weekend. Snow levels remain on track to fall to 2500-3000 feet
over the weekend, likely bringing accumulating snowfall to the
Cascade passes at times.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak shortwave upper ridging will move across Western
Washington today before a vigorous frontal system approaches the
region tonight. Westerly flow aloft today will become strong
southwesterly tonight. A mix of MVFR/VFR ceilings in scattered
showers continue this morning, and will become primarily VFR this
afternoon as clouds increase again ahead of the next front. Ceilings
will deteriorate to MVFR with rain along the coast late this
afternoon with said conditions spreading to the interior at times
late tonight. Gusty surface winds will develop along the coast late
this afternoon and spread into interior areas tonight with low level
wind shear expected as well. The gustiest winds will be along the
Washington Coast and western Whatcom/Skagit Counties with an
increase likelihood of winds gusts exceeding 40 kt late this
evening/tomorrow morning. Thunderstorms will also be possible west
of I-5, with a marginal risk for severe storms Wednesday along the
coastline.

KSEA...Ceilings are becoming VFR this morning with lower scattered
to broken clouds being replaced by mid and high level overcast
clouds through the day. Rain increases again after around 03Z
tonight though ceilings may initially remain at or above 4000 feet
late into tonight. Surface winds southwesterly wind 8 to 12 knots
becoming south southeast later this morning then increasing to 12 to
18 knots after 03z. Higher gusts and low level wind shear are likely
late tonight, with gusts exceeding 30-35 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Gale warnings remain in effect for the coastal waters,
entrances to the strait, and the northern inland waters as a
vigorous frontal system associated with a sub 990 millibar surface
low lifting northeastward offshore approaches the region. There is
an increasing risk of multiple gusts up to storm force (up to 55
kt), and a few coastal and interior zones may need to be upgraded to
storm warning for the afternoon update. The front will push onshore
Wednesday morning. Rain with thunderstorms are expected Tuesday
night into Wednesday, with a marginal risk of severe storms
Wednesday along the coast. Storms may produce small hail, gusty
winds, and a possible waterspout. Coastal seas will remain quite
hazardous into Wednesday at 15 to 20 feet. Small craft advisory
conditions are expected for the remainder of the waters. A broad
surface trough will remain over the waters Wednesday into Thursday
before high pressure briefly rebuilds over the waters on Friday.
Another frontal system will arrive on Saturday.

.HYDROLOGY...Showers will continue across the region this morning
and afternoon, before another round of more widespread rainfall
moves inland tonight into Wednesday. Additional rainfall amounts
of 4-6 inches (with locally higher amounts possible) will be
possible across portions of the Olympic Peninsula. Expect
significant rises to continue on area rivers along the Olympic
Peninsula, particularly the Skokomish River, which is forecast to
approach moderate flood stage on Wednesday.

Elsewhere, expect rises on area rivers to continue as the next
round of widespread rainfall moves through. At this time, river
flooding looks less likely for Cascade-basin rivers with snow
expected for the mountains. Snow levels will vary, however, generally
ranging from 4000 to 5500 feet across the region, which will
continue to impact precipitation type and the amount of storm
runoff. Any additional flooding extent will continue to depend on
rainfall rates, temperatures, and snow levels - and will continue
to be monitored.
