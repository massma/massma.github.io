Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
522 PM EDT Wed Sep 18 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure approaches from the south tonight and lingers offshore
through Saturday. High pressure builds in from the northeast Sunday
through Tuesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM THURSDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Developing low pressure approaches the region from the south
tonight. A low level jet ahead of the low center collocated with
enhanced moisture convergence at 850mb push in, bringing the
likelihood of rain over eastern LI and SE CT. There`s still a chance
of some rain for most other locations. PWATs increase to 1.75-2.00
inches, but convection will be lacking, however there`s enough mid
level forcing to tap into this moist airmass. Anticipating only the
potential of minor/nuisance flooding which would occur late at night
and would more likely occur over eastern LI or SE CT. See the
hydrology section below for more details.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM THURSDAY MORNING THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The coastal low lingers about 50-100 miles south of eastern Long
Island through at least Thursday night as a closed 500mb low
remains nearby. The surface low may then get nudged south and
east Friday night by high pressure attempting to build in from
SE Canada.

Once again, generally higher chances of rain over eastern zones
during Thursday where the deeper moisture and stronger
forcing/convergence remain. Slight chance to chance PoPs for most
other locations. The overall threat for rain then diminishes a
little during Thursday night, but increase back a little on Friday
with a wobble in the low pressure system - bringing back better
moisture and lift. Chances drop off again Friday night as the low
nudges south and east. It will be breezy mainly at the coast during
the short term, with N to NE winds gusting 25-30 mph. Temperatures
through the period are a blend of the previous forecast and 50th
percentile NBM, both of which are cooler than the deterministic
NBM.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...

<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>**Key Points**

*Improving conditions Saturday into Sunday as high pressure builds
into the region.

*Downward temperature trend to slightly below normal temperatures
expected by early next week.

Global guidance continues to depict the slow moving upper low/trough
situated over New England to start the period. There are varying
degrees of eastward progression on Saturday, though there is
consensus that heights will begin to rise as the low moves east by
Saturday afternoon. Thus, expecting a cloudy, and windy, Saturday
with perhaps some lingering showers though Saturday evening,
especially for eastern Long Island and southeastern CT.  Northeast
winds will begin to relax by Sunday afternoon as the low departs and
the pressure gradient weakens.

Thereafter, upper ridging begins to build in with surface high
pressure nosing in from the north. Dry conditions are generally
expected Sunday through Wednesday. A slightly cooler airmass advects
into the area for Monday and Tuesday under easterly flow and highs
in the upper 60s and low 70s. The airmass begins to moderate
somewhat on Wednesday, though still below normal in the low 70.

The NBM with some minor adjustments for Sunday was followed closely
for this update.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /20Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
Low pressure remains southeast of the terminals through the TAF
period.

VFR to start, with chances of MVFR overnight into Thursday
morning. Better chances of MVFR conditions with chances of IFR
east of NYC. Forecast is rather tricky with respect to
precipitation. Latest 12z forecast guidance has backed off on
the precip, however some forecast guidance keep rain chances in
overnight. Once again, the best chances for rain will be east of
NYC. With uncertainty remain, will cover the rain/shower threat
with PROB30s.

Higher confidence of winds. Expect NE/N flow through the TAF
period. Speeds will remain around 10kt or less through tonight.
Thursday morning, speeds increase to 10-15G25kt.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Flight categories may lower earlier than forecast.

Low confidence on precip timing.

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY...

Thursday afternoon through Friday: Periods of rain/showers
possible with with MVFR or lower conditions. NE-N gusts 20-25kt.

Saturday: Slight chance of showers with MVFR early in the morning,
then VFR. NE gusts around 25kt possible.

Sunday: VFR. NE gusts 20-25kt possible.

Monday...VFR.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>SCA has been extended on all waters through Thursday night and will
likely need to be extended at least on the ocean waters through this
weekend as an offshore low keeps winds and seas elevated. Gusts on
the ocean could reach 30 kt this weekend. For the non-ocean waters,
might need to extend the SCA into Friday, but will probably not be
needed thereafter.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cannot rule out the possibility of minor poor drainage flooding late
tonight into Thursday mainly over eastern LI and SE CT. There is now
fewer guidance suggesting the potential of moderate to heavy
rainfall, so flash flooding is not a concern at this point. Will
still need to watch model trends in rainfall amounts and the track
of the storm as the ingredients for a rainfall heavier than
currently forecast are still present. HREF probabilities of an inch
of rain in an hour are up to 30-40% not too far offshore. Expecting
a total rainfall of up to an inch and a half for these areas through
Friday, however most of this would likely fall late tonight into
Thursday morning. For the rest of the Tri-State area, no impacts
expected with rainfall amounts likely under a half of an inch.

There are no hydrologic issues for Friday through the middle of next
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Coastal flood advisories have been expanded to include SW CT
tonight in addition to the one already in effect for southern
Queens and Nassau. A statement remains up for areas adjacent to
NY Harbor. Advisories were then expanded for the Thursday
morning/early afternoon high tide cycle to include locations
adjacent to NY Harbor, western LI Sound, and the south shore
back bays of LI. A statement is in effect for eastern LI and and
New Haven county CT. Advisories will then continue for the
south shore bays and portions of western LI Sound for Thursday
night.

The combination of high astronomical spring tides and deepening
low pressure over the western Atlantic will result in several
rounds of mainly minor coastal flooding over the next couple of
days. Localized moderate coastal flooding is possible for
souther Nassau and SW Suffolk, especially Thursday morning. In
addition, as the low slowly pulls away over the weekend, tidal
piling from a long period easterly swell will continue although
astronomical tides will be gradually coming down. Thus, the
potential is there for continued minor coastal flooding into the
weekend, especially across the south shore bays of western LI
and the SW CT coast.

A high rip current risk continues through Friday for the ocean
beaches due to building E/NE swells and gusty N-NE winds. Seas
on the oceanfront will build to up around 6 ft. However, a high
surf advisory has not been issued as seas are forecast to stay
below criteria of 7 ft.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
