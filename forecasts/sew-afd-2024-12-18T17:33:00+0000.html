Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
933 AM PST Wed Dec 18 2024

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Conditions today are favored to be more relaxed
compared to yesterday`s. Showers and convergence zone activity
are lingering this morning as we`re post-frontal here across the
area. Conditions will gradually dry out by the evening but
onshore flow along with orographic enhancement will maintain PoPs
over the Cascades this afternoon. The previous discussion remains
below along with an updated marine/aviation section.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...A frontal system will continue to move across Western
Washington early this morning. Brief, dry conditions expected this
afternoon through tonight. A system will bring lighter
precipitation Thursday into Thursday night. Additional weaker
fronts will bring precipitation chances late in the week. A more
active pattern develops later in the weekend through next week.


&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Widespread stratiform
precipitation continues across Western Washington early this
morning with a cold front draped over Olympic Peninsula. Winds
will peak for most areas through approximately 500 AM as the front
slides eastward across Puget Sound and into the Cascades.
Localized power outages and tree damage remain possible into the
early morning period.

In addition, post-frontal westerly winds will increase through
the Strait of Juan de Fuca over the next few hours, reaching
Whidbey Island for another period of gusty west winds through
mid-morning. This will also bring enhanced convergence along the
cold front across portions of Admiralty Inlet into Snohomish and
Skagit Counties. Hi-res guidance highlight a thin, but impressive
band of precip moving eastward generally between 500 to 700 AM
across these aforementioned areas. This may be accompanied by
heavier rain rates, as well as brief gusty winds. Precipitation
by late morning will be confined to the Cascades, with a couple of
inches of snow possible at Stevens Pass. Precipitation will taper
this afternoon for the Cascades, allowing for drier weather into
tonight.

A warm front will move northward Thursday into early Friday for
another round of lighter lowland rain. Temperatures will remain
above normal through Friday, with highs in the low to mid 50s,
with near 60 degrees possible for Quillayute on Friday.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Another frontal system
will move across Western Washington later Saturday for lowland
rain and mountain snowfall. A stronger system is expected to
approach the area on Sunday for additional precipitation.
Ensembles suggest this active pattern continues through at least
the middle of next week, with systems accompanied by lowland rain,
mountain snowfall, and breezy winds. This is highlighted well by
the CPC Week 2 hazards outlook. Temperatures will be slightly
cooler Saturday into next week. JD

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface warm front has exited the region this
morning, with most of the showers dissipating early this morning,
the exception being a weak convergence zone near KPAE that could
bring minimized conditions into the early part of the afternoon.
Overall, conditions will continue to improve with most areas
seeing VFR/MVFR this morning trending towards mostly VFR into this
afternoon with some mid to high level clouds streaming in later
tonight.

Gusty westerly winds will continue to decrease into the afternoon,
with most places in the interior this morning gusting upwards to
20 to 25 kts. Winds later this evening will start to turn
southerly and take an easterly component into Thursday morning.

KSEA...A mix of VFR/MVFR this morning as showers have started to
dissipate at the terminal, with a rebound to complete VFR by this
afternoon. Wind gusts out of the southwest of 20 to 25 kts will
continue through around 18Z, and begin to decrease after that time
to below 12 kt.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Heavy rain has mostly ended across Western
Washington this morning. Significant rises on rivers have occurred,
including several above flood stage over the last 12 hours across
the Olympic Peninsula due to 4 to 7 inches of rainfall recorded
over the Olympics. The Skokomish River has risen above major flood
stage and will crest later today. In addition, the Bogachiel and
Satsop Rivers have risen into flood stage this morning. The
Chehalis River will continue to rise through Thursday.

Additional incoming precipitation from wet systems later in the
week and into next week will maintain the threat of river flooding
across western Washington, but models continue to show large
discrepancies and the forecast remains uncertain at this time.
