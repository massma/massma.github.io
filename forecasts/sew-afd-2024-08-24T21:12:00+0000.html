Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
212 PM PDT Sat Aug 24 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Precipitation will come to an end this afternoon,
leading to a mostly clear Sunday. Another system will brush the
region to the north for another round of light rain on Monday.
Upper level ridging takes hold on Tuesday and will last into the
end of the week for warmer and drier conditions.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The back end of the
precipitation is now visible and will be moving to the southeast.
There will still be considerable cloudiness, but in the northern
part of the CWA, there could be some scattering out for more
sunshine. Sunday will be drier and feature more sunshine by the
afternoon as shortwave ridging builds into the area. This
particular ridge is going to be short lived as another low
pressure system is pushed into the northern half of the region for
another shot of light rain on Monday afternoon. The best chances
for another wetting rain out of this system will be in the North
Cascades. Areas elsewhere will see a few hundredths to a few
tenths of an inch.

This system will eject eastward quickly and be replaced by more
robust ridging by Tuesday. With considerable moisture leftover
from previous rain, the subsidence from the ridge will take a
while to establish. As such, temperatures will be slower to warm
up, but Tuesday will see highs in the upper 60s.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...The mid to late week
period will be warmer and drier as the upper level ridge remains
in place. High temperatures will rebound into the upper 70s by
Wednesday and push 80 degrees again by Thursday and Friday. Given
the positioning of the high and a thermal trough along the
Washington and Oregon coast, the forecast indicates some light
offshore flow on Thursday and Friday. Right now, the indications
of a stronger east wind event are not present nor concerning for
fire weather implications, especially in the wake of anomalous
precipitation amounts for August. Temperatures will be in the low
to mid 80s come Friday and Saturday. Anything warmer than that at
this point does not seem likely given the synoptic pattern and
projected strength of the offshore flow.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough over the region will continue to
slowly shift eastward through the evening. This will lead to
increasingly northwest flow aloft, and the associated precipitation
will continue to shift to the south and east. This will maintain a
mix of MVFR and IFR ceilings through the afternoon, but some
scattering and lifting is likely toward 00z and into the evening.
The air mass remains moist and expect a return of low clouds to most
of the area overnight through Sunday morning.

KSEA...Expect MVFR ceilings to linger for the next few hours with
some improvement after 00z as rain pushes away and winds seas. Light
southerly winds continue overnight and with moist lower air mass,
expect return of lower MVFR ceilings overnight through Sunday
morning. Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure continues to push eastward, and this is
bringing an end to the strongest of winds through the interior
waters. Some local gusts around 20-25 kt are possible in the central
Strait of Juan de Fuca, but winds generally easing. Weak high
pressure will then rebuild through Sunday, followed by frontal
system arrives Monday night into Tuesday. Will see some stronger
westerly winds through the Strait of Juan de Fuca and portions of
the coastal waters with this frontal system, representing the next
best chance of seeing advisory conditions. Meanwhile, seas remain
rather choppy over the coastal waters with short period conditions.
A more typical pattern for late summer then returns late next week,
bringing another round of breezy diurnally-driven winds and steep
seas.  Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
