.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Isolated light showers possible throughout the week,
primarily along the coast and Cascades. A weak cold front on
Friday will bring cooler temperatures into the weekend. Drier
conditions over the weekend as an upper level ridge builds over
Washington.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The low pressure system
that was spinning off the Pacific Ocean has now moved southward
into Oregon. As the weather system moves east, scattered showers
are still possible (30-60%) through Friday, especially along the
coast and Cascades. However, precipitation amounts will be light
and should have no significant impacts during the holiday week.
Light winds and abundant low-level moisture may lead to morning
patchy fog development in the Chehalis Valley and other localized
areas of Western Washington through Friday. Expect low
temperatures in the low to mid 30s in the interior and upper 30s
along the coast. High temperatures will be in the mid to upper
40s.

A weak cold front is expected to move through the region on
Friday as an upper level ridge will begin to propagate eastward
setting up the upper level pattern for the holiday weekend.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...There is good agreement
between ensemble guidance that an upper level ridge moving
eastward will build over Washington and dominate the upper level
pattern over the weekend. In addition, ensembles indicate that
the ridge will amplify early next week. Drier conditions are
expected with this upper level pattern. However, some disturbances
in the flow have the NBM guidance hinting at some PoPs during the
weekend (20%) and increasing early next week (30-45%),
particularly along the coast and Cascades. As of now, any
precipitation that does occur will be light and should pose no
significant impacts.

As for the holiday weekend, expect low temperatures in the low to
mid 30s. High temperatures will be in the 40s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northerly flow aloft with a shortwave impulse over
southern Oregon and a ridge building offshore over the northeast
Pacific.

As expected, ceilings have risen since this morning across the
region, with an overcast cloud deck being present at 020-030kft at
the majority of sites this afternoon. MVFR conditions remain in
place in the interior, as while this morning`s low clouds have
decreased in coverage, they are still present. Ceilings should
continue to trend towards VFR this afternoon, but at least a few
sites are likely to remain MVFR with isolated showers still being
observed. Going into this evening and overnight, low clouds and
fog will once again redevelop, particularly in the southwest
interior and along the east slopes of the Olympics. Tomorrow
morning, more widespread MVFR conditions are expected, and
ceilings will once again improve towards VFR going into the
afternoon.

Winds this afternoon remain light and variable (less than 6kt),
with coastal stations reporting northwesterly winds, while
interior observations show north/northeasterly flow.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings have continued to remain in place at the
terminal this afternoon with a broken cloud deck most recently
observed at 015kft. Winds have slackened as expected throughout
today, and weak (4-6kt) northeasterly winds are expected through
tonight. Conditions should continue to bounce between MVFR and
VFR until tonight, when a return to consistent MVFR conditions and
the potential for showers exists in the early morning hours.
Winds are still expected to turn southerly overnight between
05-08z.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will continue to build over the coastal
waters today into tomorrow and remain in place through at least this
weekend. Winds remain light northwesterly through the week, becoming
southerly this weekend. Seas 2 to 4 ft through the week, increasing
to 6 to 8 ft this weekend as long period swell arrives to the area
from a system over Alaska.
