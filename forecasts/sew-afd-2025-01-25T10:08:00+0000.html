Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Offshore upper-level ridge building into Northern
British Columbia over the weekend with the ridge moving directly
over Western Washington Monday and Tuesday. Rain and mountain snow
returns on Thursday as the ridge exits east.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure remains
dominant over the Pac NW leading to more dry/stable conditions
this weekend and into early next week. Expect cold temperatures
in the 20s and 30s each morning. Highs will reach the mid 40s with
plenty of sunshine. 33

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...More of the same moving
through the first half of the week as the ridge slides inland. The
air mass is a little warmer with high temperatures in the mid/upper
40s to around 50. Offshore winds keep us cloud free. Morning lows
are still chilly and in the 20s to lower 30s.

The pattern changes on Thursday as a trough kicks the ridge east
and farther inland. A frontal system will spread rain inland for a
shot of rain across the region. A flip to onshore flow will keep
us warmer (overnight) with temperatures remaining above freezing.
Weak troughing keeps showers in the forecast as we move into
Friday with a few inches of snow in the mountains. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northerly flow aloft shifting more northeasterly
throughout the day due to the interplay between upper level ridging
over the Pacific and an upper trough over central California. At the
surface, locations that are not reporting light and variable winds
seeing easterly flow with variations to the northeast or southeast
depending on location/terrain with speeds generally falling within 4-
8 kts, although isolated bursts of 8-12 kts have been observed at
SEA and BLI. The exception to all of this is CLM thanks to influence
from the Strait, with westerly to southwesterly winds. By late
morning, directions should turn mostly north to northeasterly with
speeds generally 4-8 kts.

Mostly VFR conditions in place for most terminals, however isolated
patches of MVFR to IFR conditions present around OLM and portions of
northern Snohomish county...north of PAE. All terminals expected to
be VFR by late morning and continuing into at least during the early
morning hours Sunday.

KSEA...VFR conditions expected throughout the TAF period. North to
northeasterly surface winds 9 to 13 kts expected through at least
12Z, however some guidance suggests those speeds will persist at
least into the late morning. If current speeds persist, may nudge
12Z TAF toward that solution. Speeds should ease after 03Z, ranging
4 to 8 kts.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface ridging strengthens over interior British
Columbia and east of the Cascades today while a broad surface trough
deepens well to the south over California. This will lead to
northerly or weak offshore flow. This general pattern remains in
place into early next week. The next front will approach the coastal
waters around the middle of next week.

Seas 5 to 7 ft easing slightly to 4 to 6 ft by late morning and
remaining that way for much of the weekend. Seas will ease further,
down to 3 to 5 ft, Monday and remain that way into the middle of
next week, rising again ahead of the aforementioned front.
