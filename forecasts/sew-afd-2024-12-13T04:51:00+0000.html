Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
851 PM PST Thu Dec 12 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Light showers will continue across the area tonight
as a disturbance moves across northern California. A stronger
system will move into the region on Friday, bringing gusty winds,
lowland rain, mountain snow, and high surf to western Washington.
Coastal flooding will impact the shorelines of western Washington
throughout weekend. A wet and active weather pattern will persist
into early next week.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Forecast remains on track
tonight with no updates. Previous short/long term sections follow.

Light showers will continue across the area this evening as a
system continues to move across northern California. With snow
levels hovering between 3000-4000 feet, light snow accumulations
will be possible in the mountains. Mainly under 1 inch is expected
for the Cascade passes.


A stronger system is expected to impact western Washington Friday
into the weekend. This system will bring gusty winds, widespread
lowland rain, mountain snow, and high surf to the area with
impacts expected through Sunday. Coastal flooding will impact the
shorelines of western Washington through the weekend as well.
Details on hazards expected with this system are highlighted
below:

LOWLAND RAIN: Rain is expected to start moving into the region
along the coast on Friday morning and become more widespread
throughout the day. Periods of rain will continue through Sunday
with the heaviest rainfall accumulations expected along the coast
and Olympic Peninsula. Isolated thunderstorms are also possible
along the Pacific Coast on Saturday - with the main hazards being
small hail, brief heavy downpours, erratic winds, and lightning.

MOUNTAIN SNOW: Snow levels on Friday will range between 3000 to
4500 ft and will fall to around 3500 ft by Saturday. Snow is
expected for areas above 3500 ft. Snow levels will then fall to
around 2000 ft by Sunday. Uncertainty remains in the snow forecast
with easterly winds persisting in the passes. Locally higher
amounts will be possible should snow levels remain lower as a
result.

WINDS: Winds will begin to increase on Friday afternoon, peak
overnight, and are expected to subside through the day Saturday.
The strongest winds are expected along the coast, the San Juan
Islands, Whidbey Island, Whatcom County, and Skagit County.
Maximum winds gusts of 30 to 40 mph are possible in these areas.

COASTAL FLOODING: Coastal flooding is expected along the Pacific
Coast on Friday. The flooding threat will persist for the outer
coast through the weekend and will gradually move inland through
the weekend. Flooding is expected during the late morning to mid-
day high tides. Significant coastal flooding will be possible
along the Pacific Coast on Saturday with an inundation of 2-3 ft
above ground level possible. Large waves building along the
Pacific coast could exacerbate impacts to coastal communities.

HIGH SURF: Large waves will build towards 17 to 19 feet at around
along the Pacific Coast on Saturday. Large waves may wash over
beaches, jetties, and other structures unexpectedly. Localized
beach erosion will be possible.

Showers will persist into Sunday, but look to gradually taper
through the day as a transient upper ridge moves over the area.
This reprieve will be short-lived, however, as yet another system
looks to move into the region Sunday night into Monday.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Conditions look to remain
active into early next week as another system moves into the
region on Monday. Expect additional periods of lowland rain and
mountain snow to persist through Tuesday. Ensemble guidance then
indicates an upper level ridge building across the Western US by
midweek. There remains some uncertainty in the amplitude and
placement of the ridge axis, however. If the ridge axis moves too
far inland, it could keep western Washington susceptible to
additional systems moving into the region. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak disturbance continues to lift north bringing
additional moisture into the region. This will continue to support
scattered lingering showers and lower ceilings over the region.
Widespread MVFR conditions in place with a handful of sites already
down into IFR/LIFR. Models continue to show a slight improvement in
cigs areawide overnight...with most locations either being MVFR or
possibly getting into low-end VFR, although locations prone to lower
cigs may prove to be outliers and remain IFR. Most terminals
experiencing southerly surface winds overnight with speeds generally
5-10 kts. Expect a shift to easterly winds by mid-afternoon Friday
as the next weather system approaches.

KSEA...Sea-Tac continues to waffle between IFR and low-end MVFR this
evening as showers linger. General model trends continue to hint at
some improvement overnight with the terminal recovering to at least
solid MVFR conditions. This would be less than what is in current
TAF and will adjust for upcoming 06Z issuance. Better agreement
emerges when considering VFR conditions by Friday afternoon as
incoming weather system will facilitate mixing. As stated above,
winds shifting easterly by Friday afternoon. Wind speeds generally
remaining 5-10 kts.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak frontal system associated with an occluded surface
low will continue to slowly drift inland. Winds will begin to
increase Friday along the coastal waters ahead of a strong low
pressure system that move to the northwest of the area Friday into
Saturday. Gale force winds are very likely across the coastal waters
Friday evening into Saturday, with the potential for some storm
force gusts, particularly through the outer coastal waters. Winds
will initially be southeasterly then switching to southwesterly on
Saturday as the low moves towards Vancouver Island. Winds will also
increase over the interior waters, with Small Craft Advisory winds
likely Friday night into Saturday.

The Gale Warning for the coastal waters remains in effect along with
the a Small Craft Advisory for the East Strait of Juan de Fuca,
where winds will begin to increase earlier on Friday.

A surface ridge will briefly build over the waters on Sunday before
another frontal system will move through the area on Monday, which
will likely bring another period of breezy winds and large seas.

Seas 8 to 12 ft today will rapidly build Friday up to 16 to 20 ft
(with up to 23 ft possible through the outer coastal waters) through
Saturday. Seas should subside below 10 ft on Sunday but look to
increase again on Monday.

.HYDROLOGY...Next round of precipitation with a weak system
today will only result in small rises on the rivers. A stronger
storm will set up along the coast over the weekend with the
potential to bring more significant precipitation to the region.
Latest guidance has been uncertain regarding rainfall amounts in
the Olympics, with overall totals being lower than originally
forecasted. Area rivers will rise, with only the Skokomish River
being expected to reach above action stage. Right now, the
forecast did lower, with the river hovering just under minor flood
stage Saturday into early Sunday. This will continued to be
monitored as more guidance becomes available. Additional rounds
of precipitation could keep the Skokomish river at or near flood
stage into early next week. We will continue to monitor the
rainfall forecast and the river forecast for this weekend.
