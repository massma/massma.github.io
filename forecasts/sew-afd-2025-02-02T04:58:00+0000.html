Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
858 PM PST Sat Feb 1 2025

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper-low continues to churn showers into W WA this
evening. Any lingering rain showers or mixed precipitation is
slated to fully transition to snow showers tonight. As a result, a
Winter Weather Advisory goes into effect tonight with up to 1 to 3
inches of accumulation possible for the much of the lowlands (aside
from Puget Sound given shadowing effects) and mountain foothills.
The inherited forecast remains on track as the previous
discussion is below along with an updated aviation section.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low will continue to remain centered
over the region into next week. This will bring cooler air into the
region, with mixed precipitation showers transitioning to snow
showers Saturday night into Sunday, and lasting into the week.
Snow accumulations are possible in the lowlands, ranging from less
than inch to a few inches from Saturday night into Monday. Fraser
River outflow is expected to aid in bringing well below average
temperatures into the region next week, with wind chills dropping
into the teens and twenties.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...

KEY MESSAGES:

 - Mixed precipitation showers will transition to snow showers
   Saturday night into Monday. Lowland accumulations are expected
   to range from less than an inch (few places may have no snow
   accumulations) to a few inches of snow. Snow shower chances
   will last through the week (light or no accumulations).

 - Well below average temperatures will settle into the region
   early next week. Wind chill values may drop into the teens and
   twenties (few areas in Whatcom County may see wind chills in
   the single digits).

DISCUSSION: A trough and low pressure system remains centered just
off the north tip of Vancouver Island/Central B.C. with a jet core
on the WA/OR border. A vort max will swing through the state
Sunday into Monday. There`s not any organized fronts (except for a
couple of stationary fronts to the north and west of the region).

Radar shows scattered showers over all of Western WA this afternoon.
Temperatures at the surface remain just above freezing (from the mid
30s up north in Whatcom County to the upper 30s and low 40s in the
rest of the lowlands). Precipitation along the coast has been
falling as rain (with the onshore flow). Further inland, mixed
precipitation has been observed with showers moving inland, with the
heaviest of showers producing the colder hydrometeors
(graupel/snow/sleet). There is a very low chance of thunder with
this activity through the afternoon into tonight, but no
organized thunderstorms are expected with this activity (best
chance is along the coastline). Heavy snow will also continue in
the Cascades through this evening (winter storm warning was
extended to 7 PM) - this will taper back to snow showers through
to Monday, with minimal impacts expected.

For lowland areas: Cold air will begin sinking down from aloft
tonight into Sunday. Low temperatures will also be a few degrees
cooler with more areas below freezing. The mixed precipitation
showers are expected to transition to all snow showers (except for
immediate coastal areas) tonight/Sunday morning.

Accumulations: majority of the snow showers expected from tonight
through late Monday morning will produce some snow accumulations
(especially with heavier convective showers). Due the nature of
the coverage of the showers, some locations may not receive snow
at all, and some may see more snow than others. Right now (with
HREF guidance coming in), the highest confidence for at least 1-3
inches of snow are under winter weather advisories Saturday night
to noon Monday (San Juan/Western Whatcom/Skagit Counties, East
Puget Sound Lowlands, Tacoma area, Chehalis Valley, Pacific Coast,
and West Strait of Juan de Fuca). These areas are most likely to
see snowfall accumulations producing slippery road conditions
(especially the Monday morning commute). With some shadow from the
Olympics becoming more evident over the Kitsap/Seattle/Everett
areas, this dropped the confidence for advisory amounts of snow in
these areas for the afternoon update. There still will most
likely be just under an inch of snow in these areas, and the
forecast still may change between now and Monday to expand the
advisory. But given the constrained QPF/moisture, it may be tricky
to get accumulations any higher to the current forecast. Snow
showers are expected to be light after Monday (with little or no
snow accumulations).

Cold temperatures: Fraser River outflow is expected to be delayed
to Monday morning for Whatcom County. The air may struggle
to dig southward towards the Admiralty Inlet/Strait of Juan de
Fuca area until Monday night (which may also affect snow
accumulations). Nevertheless, EFI anomalies shows very cold air
sinking over most of the region by Monday night. The cold air is
expected to remain through the week. This will most likely produce
highs into the mid 30s, and lows into the twenties and teens.
Wind chills will drop into the low 20s for most lowland areas
(with teens and a few single digit values possible towards the
Canadian border in Whatcom County). This cold will likely require
cold weather advisories in future updates going into next week (as
it will likely affect vulnerable populations without adequate
access to heating).

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Ensembles/models have
the trough pattern continuing into next weekend. The low may fill
and weaken or split towards the end of week, but confidence is
moderate with the cold air lasting through the end of next week. Low
wind chill values in the advisory category appear to last through
Friday morning, with a slight improvement possible by Saturday.
There is very limited moisture during this period, but given the
nature/dynamics of the low overhead, there will be the potential for
a few light snow showers each day. Snow accumulations are not
expected in this forecast window at this time.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A moist southwest/west flow remains in place across
western Washington this evening with an upper level low remaining
over the Pacific Northwest. The cool air mass will continue to
support low snow levels and mixed rain/snow showers over the
lowlands. These will be most prominent in a maintaining convergence
zone and more scattered elsewhere. Additional rounds of snow will
bring lowering conditions at times through Sunday morning, with more
widespread snow showers late Sunday evening into early Monday. Gusty
southerly surface winds ease this evening.

KSEA...Continued showers around the terminal area at times
overnight, but shadowing should limit activity at the terminal
itself much of the evening. Additional showers around 12z with likely
rain/snow mix but light to no accumulation. Expect MVFR conditions
much of the period with easing southerly winds overnight.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow will ease this evening with strongest winds
through the strait and over Puget Sound and Hood Canal. Broad low
pressure over the Coastal Waters on Sunday with generally light
wind. Offshore flow increasing late Sunday and into Monday with
N/NE Fraser River outflow winds over the Northern Inland Waters
and strait. Offshore flow prevails through much of the week ahead.
