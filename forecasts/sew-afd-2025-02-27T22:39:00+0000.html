Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
239 PM PST Thu Feb 27 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak front has dissipated over the region this
morning, leaving warm and dry conditions into Friday. Chances of
showers return over the weekend and into early next week as
troughing redevelops over the area.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
plentiful sun across the area with some thin high level cloud
cover. The remaining of the day will continue remain dry due to
upper level ridging over western Washington. High temperatures
over the area this afternoon will generally range from the upper
50s into the lower 60s.

These warm and dry conditions will continue into Friday as upper
level ridging remains over the area. Areas of some patchy fog are
possible early Friday morning, developing along the coast and in
the Chehalis valley. Another warm day is on tap, with afternoon
high temperatures continuing to be in the upper 50s into the low
60s for much for the interior.

The aforementioned upper level ridge axis will shift eastward on
Saturday, allowing for an upper level trough to enter the region.
Uncertainty still remains in the exact track of this trough, but
likely will see increased chances of showers through Sunday, all
remaining rather light across the region. Temperatures will cool
slightly over the weekend, with afternoon highs in the low to mid
50s, and morning lows staying steady in the upper 30s to lower
40s.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...The unsettled pattern looks
to continue into the long term as the aforementioned upper level
trough shifts southward on Monday, keeping the chance of showers
in the forecast. Ensembles look to indicate a transient upper
level ridge moving over the region through midweek, but looks
rather weak. Therefore, kept chances of showers in the forecast
through the remainder of the long term. Temperatures will
generally stay in the low to mid 50s and overnight lows in the
upper 30s to lower 40s.

..AVIATION...West to southwest flow continues aloft as a
weak front dissipates over the area and a weak upper ridge
rebuilds tonight into Friday. Light low level flow tonight into
early Friday will allow for the formation of IFR ceilings
and pockets of LIFR overnight. Low clouds will scatter out for a
return to VFR on Friday afternoon across interior areas.

KSEA...Light surface flow and moisture from a dissipating front will
be favorable for the return of IFR ceilings 11Z-15Z Friday. Low
clouds are expected to scatter out by around 20Z Friday. W/SW
surface winds are expected to veer to very light northerly (5 knots
or less) this evening into Friday morning.  27

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak high pressure will briefly rebuild tonight into
Friday before another trough digs southward across the offshore
waters Saturday into Sunday. A weak trough will remain over area
waters on Monday. High pressure will weakly rebuild Tuesday.

Seas in the 9 to 12 foot range tonight will subside on Friday
before rebuilding Friday night into the 10 to 14 foot range. Seas
will subside back under 10 feet early next week.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
