Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
355 PM PST Thu Feb 20 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A warm front will move across Western Washington
Friday night into Saturday for increasing rain. An atmospheric
river will bring heavy rain as well as gusty winds at times
Saturday through early Monday. Another stronger weather system
offshore will bring additional precipitation and the potential for
gusty winds later Monday. Drier weather will be possible
beginning Wednesday into Thursday with warming temperatures.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Generally dry weather
across Western Washington this afternoon with mostly cloudy skies
under weak ridging influence. Rainfall will move onshore this
evening continue to spread eastward into northern Puget Sound
tonight into Friday morning. Precipitation will increase further
later Friday into Friday night as a warm front moves across
Western Washington. Snow levels will also rise during this period,
initially beginning around 3500 feet before increasing to 5500
feet by Saturday morning. Initially snow expected for most of the
Cascade Passes Friday evening before transitioning to rain by
Saturday morning. There may be a brief period of freezing rain
over Snoqualmie Pass Friday night with continued east winds at the
surface and warming aloft. However, any amounts are expected to
be limited due to a quick transition to rain by Saturday morning.

An atmospheric river pattern will then develop over the weekend,
resulting in heavy rain at times and rising snow levels. There
remains some uncertainty as to the progression of embedded systems
during this period, resulting in continued spread in QPF amounts.
With that said, current forecast QPF amounts from Saturday through
Sunday night range 4 to 7 inches over the Olympics and 3 to 5
inches for the Cascades. This will result in rises on area rivers
into early next week. Refer to the .HYDROLOGY section for further
information regarding river flooding.

In addition to the heavy rain and potential river flooding, gusty
southerly winds will occur at times Saturday and Sunday. At this
time, the first round of initial gusty winds is on Saturday,
peaking Saturday afternoon into Saturday evening. NBM
probabilities highlight the coast and areas north of Everett for
the higher chance of gusts exceeding 45 MPH, with probabilities
ranging 50 to 80%. Winds will remain breezy elsewhere on Saturday.
This may lead to localized power outages and tree damage. Another
round of breezy winds are then expected on Sunday, especially for
the aforementioned areas above. Temperatures will warm above
average over the weekend under the influence of Pacific moisture,
with highs in the mid 50s.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...There may be a brief break
in the heavier precipitation Monday morning. With that said,
concern then shifts to an intensifying low pressure system in the
Pacific as it tracks towards Vancouver Island. Another round of
steadier rain will spread northwards into Western Washington on
Monday into early Tuesday. Uncertainty remains in ensembles in
the intensity and track of the low pressure system, resulting in a
range in wind gust potential. Even so, ECMWF EFI highlights all
of Western Washington for anomalous winds to climo early next
week. The uncertainty in wind magnitude is seen on the NBM spread
of wind gusts from 10th-90th percentile, for example, the 10th
percentile max gusts (MPH) along the coast is in the low 30s, with
the 90th percentile in the mid 60s. Given the track, this system
will need to continue to be monitored as we move closer to Monday.
In addition, relatively higher snow levels Monday may fall
towards Pass level by Tuesday, resulting in additional snowfall
for the Cascades and Olympics.

Ensembles then show an upper ridge building into the interior
Pacific Northwest by Wednesday, allowing for potentially drier
conditions along with warming temperatures through Thursday. Highs
initially in the low 50s early next week may reach upper 50s to
near 60 by Wednesday. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West to northwest flow aloft will continue as an upper
level ridge gets pushed east by a trough over British Columbia.
Ceilings remain largely around 3000 ft, right at MVFR/VFR threshold.
Expect ceilings to slowly break up and lift this afternoon, giving
way to VFR conditions as mid and high level clouds fill in ahead of
an incoming system this evening. Rain will begin to spread across
the region from north to south throughout the day tomorrow, allowing
CIGs to drop back to MVFR by tomorrow afternoon. South/southwesterly
winds will begin to back to easterly tonight. Winds will become
southerly once again tomorrow and stronger, ranging form around 8 to
15 kt.

KSEA...Broken MVFR to VFR cigs this afternoon will eventually give
way to VFR cigs as mid to high level clouds fill in this evening
that will persist overnight tonight. S/SW winds will back to E/SE
tonight. Winds return to S tomorrow and increase to around 8 to 12
kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Winds will begin to increase once again over the area late
tonight into tomorrow as a frontal system begins to approach the
offshore waters. Winds will increase over the coastal waters first
tonight, then over the East Strait of Juan de Fuca and Admiralty
Inlet early tomorrow morning. Small Craft Advisory conditions will
continue through most of the day Friday until the front moves
through Friday evening. A break in the winds Friday evening will be
very short lived as the next system will arrive on its heels
Saturday, which looks to bring gale force southerly winds to the
coastal waters and potentially also the East Strait of Juan de Fuca.
Winds will persist into Sunday as another system trails behind the
Saturday system.

A more robust low pressure system looks to pass just to the
northeast of the coastal waters towards Vancouver Island Monday into
Tuesday. There are differences between models on the exact strength,
timing, and path that this low will take, but the potential exists
for strong gales or even storm force winds (25-40% probability of
storm force winds) across the coastal waters and seas in excess of
20 ft during this time period.

Seas presently around 7 to 8 ft will increase tonight into Friday to
12 to 15 ft. Seas will go up and down with the passing of each
system but look to remain in the 12 to 17 ft range through the
weekend. As mentioned previously, higher seas reaching or exceeding
20 ft may be possible with the stronger system Monday into Tuesday
of next week.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A series of storms starting Friday will bring a
potential for river flooding, urban flooding, and landslides this
weekend into early next week. An atmospheric river event is forecast
to bring heavy precipitation and much higher snow levels to the
Pacific Northwest this weekend through the early part of next week.
There remains a high likelihood (greater than 70% chance) of 3 to 4
inches of rain across the mountains, and around a 40% to 50% chance
of seeing a 5+ inch total in the favored locations of the Olympics
and the central Cascades.

This heavy rainfall, coupled with snow levels around 6000 ft or
higher during the bulk of the precipitation, will bring rises on
many area rivers and could bring a handful near or above flood
stage, especially in the Olympics, the central and southern
Cascades, and southwest Washington. Additionally, the Skokomish
River is expected to flood as early as Saturday. A Flood Watch is
out for Mason County for the Skokomish River and a Flood Potential
Outlook is out for much of the rest of Washington for the
possibility of river flooding. Urban and small stream nuisance
flooding is possible during the heaviest rainfall on Saturday and
Sunday. This amount of rain will also increase the threat of
landslides throughout the episode.
