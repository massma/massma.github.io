Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
358 AM EDT Sun Oct 8 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure deepens and occludes to the north of the area in
eastern Canada and gradually weakens through the middle of the
week. A frontal system approaches late in the week, possibly
impacting the area by next Saturday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A drier and cooler airmass continues to establish itself in the area
behind a cold frontal passage associated with a deepening low
pressure system positioned well to the north. This low pressure
will occlude and continue to spin over Eastern Canada through
the middle of the week as it weakens.

For today, breezy conditions are expected with west winds 15-20
mph with gusts upwards of 30 mph possible. Highs will be in the
upper 50s to low 60s. With the upper level trough to the north,
ample daytime heating of the surface may allow for the
development of some showers into the afternoon but showers
should be fairly isolated and confined to the northern portions
of the CWA. Any showers that develop dissipate by evening.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The pressure gradient begins to relax a bit tonight and as a
result winds will continue to weaken. Combined with clear skies,
this may allow for temperatures tonight to drop into the 40s for
much of the area. Some areas in the interior may drop into the
30s.

Fairly persistent conditions are then expected on Monday with a
W/SW flow and dry conditions as the area remains at the base of
a large trough with the surface cyclone spinning well to the
north. Temperatures will once again be below average with highs
maxing out around 60.

As pieces of energy rotate around the base of the trough and the
cut off low, some additional cloud cover with possible shower
development will become possible Monday night and into Tuesday.
Capped precipitation at a low-end chance as there is uncertainty
in the development of any showers late Monday night and through
the day Tuesday. Otherwise, Tuesday is expected to be closer to
average with highs in the low to middle 60s. Shower chances
diminish by Tuesday night as the piece of energy moves to the
northeast. Lows Tuesday night are expected to be in the 40s and
low 50s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level closed low remains nearly stationary over southeastern
Canada on Wednesday before gradually shifting east Thursday into
early Friday. While a brief ridge moves over the northeast late
Friday, another closed upper level low is progged to approach,
potentially impacting the area next weekend.

At the surface, a frontal boundary continues moving offshore on
Wednesday with weak high pressure setting up across the Middle
Atlantic. Low pressure associated with the upper level closed low
over southeast Canada will continue filling/weakening as it pushes
towards the Maritimes through Friday. A surface trough or stationary
front may lie over the Middle Atlantic Thursday night into early
Friday. As the upper low pushes east, a broad trough axis may slide
across the region Thursday night into Friday, interacting with the
boundary to the south. Some weak warm advection could lead to some
light rain, which model consensus of a low chance PoP seems
reasonable at this time.

Attention then turns to the next frontal system associated with the
next upper closed low. Deterministic global models and their
ensemble means are in good agreement with the larger scale set up
heading into next weekend. However, specific details are much more
uncertain. These include the track and timing of the upper low and
associated frontal system and whether or not the primary low will
transfer to a secondary low near the coast. Individual ensemble
members indicate spread which is to be expected at this time range.
Some show a progressive system while others are much slower, with
the associated rain holding off for the second half of next weekend.
Another widespread rainfall event is possible, but more specific
details will not be fully resolved for at least several more days.
Have capped NBM PoPs at chance on Saturday given these uncertainties.

Temperatures should be near normal in the lower to middle 60s
Wednesday through Friday. Temperatures may trend below normal for
next weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /07Z SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure will deepen across southeastern Canada into this
afternoon, then remain nearly stationary tonight

VFR through the TAF period.

W winds 10-12 kt early this morning with some gusts around 20 kt. W
sustained winds increase to 10-15 kt with gusts 20-25 kt after day
break into the afternoon. The wind direction likely backs to the WSW
late in the afternoon into the evening. Gusts diminish after sunset
with sustained speeds falling below 10 kt overnight.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Gusts at JFK and LGA before 12z may be occasional. A few gusts 17-
20kt possible at EWR and TEB before 12z.

Timing of stronger winds and gusts may be off by 1-2 hours.

OUTLOOK FOR 06Z MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...

Sunday Night: VFR..

Monday: Mainly VFR. Low chance of showers at night. SW winds G15-
20kt possible in the afternoon.

Tuesday...Mainly VFR. Low chance of showers with MVFR possible,
mainly in the morning.

Wednesday and Thursday...VFR.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Gusty W winds will bring SCA to all waters through the day.
Winds diminish this evening and non-ocean waters become sub-
SCA. For the ocean, seas will likely remain above 5 ft tonight
with gradually diminishing winds.

Seas on the ocean are progged to be in the 3-5 ft range Monday
and into early Tuesday before dropping below SCA thresholds. Winds
and seas are expected to remain below SCA levels Wednesday and
Thursday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No hydrologic impacts expected through Friday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Long period SE swells from the remnant low of Phillipe will
present the likelihood of additional beach erosion/escarpment
from an east to west sweep of 5 to 7 ft breaking surf. Because
water levels are not astronomically high, the dune erosion
threat during times of high tide is isolated. Swells subside
into tonight.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
