Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
339 AM PST Sat Dec 14 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong frontal system moving into Western Washington
today will produce gusty winds, lowland rain, mountain snow, and
high surf conditions. Coastal flooding is expected to impact the
shorelines throughout the weekend. A series of additional frontal
systems will cross the area into the middle of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Good morning, western WA.
Active weather will persist throughout the day as a stout
disturbance churns offshore. An upper-trough is lifting
northeastward along with its associated 977 mb surface low about
125nm WSW of La Push. It`ll continue before filling over Vancouver
Island and SW BC this afternoon. With it, widespread rain,
mountain snow, gusty winds and high surf/Coastal Flooding will be
an issue.


Winter Weather: To start, a Winter Storm Warning has been
upgraded from a previous advisory for the North Cascades at
elevations 3500 ft or greater. Snow totals up to 1 to 2 ft are
expected through Sunday morning. Winter Weather Advisories remain
for the Central/Southern Cascade zones for areas 3500 ft or
greater through Sunday morning with up to 8 to 12 inches. SSW
winds along the face of Mt. Baker has lead to impressive totals so
far with 14" observed since Friday afternoon with more expected
through tonight.

Wind: The aforementioned surface low has deepened considerably allowing
a decent offshore gradient to set up from Quillayute to
Bellingham. As a response, strong winds are expected as a High
Wind warning remains for the North Coast with gusts upwards of 55
to potentially 60 mph. HREF guidance indicates a 80% chance of
gusts greater than 55 mph through midday today for locations such
as Neah Bay, La Push, etc. A Wind Advisory also continues for the
Central Coast, San Juan Islands, and Inland locations such as W
Whatcom, W Skagit, and Admiralty Inlet to name a few. Any
lingering wind related headlines should be allowed to expire this
afternoon. Breezy conditions are expected throughout Puget Sound
and SW interior but these locations should avoid and headlines as
of now.

High Surf & Coastal flooding: Big waves have been generated by
this disturbance as seas as high as 20 ft have been observed
offshore near Buoy 46041. Large breaking waves up to 20 ft are
expected in the surf zone. Storm surge along with the current
high tide cycle will lead to the possibility of 2.00 to 3.50 ft of
water above ground level for shorelines and low-lying areas along
the Pacific and Strait of Juan de Fuca Coasts and San Juan`s
through this afternoon where a Coastal Flood Warning has been
issued. A Coastal Flood Advisory continues for both W Whatcom and
W Skagit counties through this afternoon as well with inundation
up to 2 ft possible for shorelines.

Showers are to remain in the forecast for Sunday as we`ll see
somewhat of a brief reprieve. Upper-ridging will track overhead
as guidance has us in between systems. However, late Sunday night
into Monday the next frontal disturbance is line to arrive with
another shot of widespread precipitation. High temperatures
throughout the short-term forecast will remain in the 40s with
overnight lows in the 30s and 40s.


.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Confidence in the pattern
going into next week is rather low. Generally, the ensembles are
trying to signal an upper-ridge over the Intermountain West by the
midweek. This places western Washington on the periphery of the
mentioned ridge, leaving us susceptible to a potential atmospheric
river. The 12Z ECMWF ensembles have zoned in on this, but other
model ensembles are not in favor. Additional disturbance are
likely through the remainder of the week but again, confidence is
not particularly high at this time.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Currently southeasterly flow across the terminals that
will gradually transition to southwesterly flow after 15Z on
Saturday. Rain currently moving across Western Washington and will
continue throughout the day on Saturday. Some of the rain may be
moderate to heavy at times which may result in the lowering of
ceilings and visibility. During some of the heavier precipitation
expect VFR conditions to trend down to MVFR or IFR. Overall
conditions are expected to trend VFR/MVFR for the terminals on
Saturday morning as rainfall moves across the terminals. Conditions
are expected to improve back to VFR Saturday afternoon.

Strong winds are expected to last through Saturday afternoon.
Terminals near the coast and north of Everett will see the strongest
winds, with maximum wind gusts between 35-45 kts possible. Winds
should gradually begin to subside in the evening on Saturday.

KSEA...VFR conditions currently at the terminal. However, rain
showers that pass over the terminal may lower visibility and
ceilings down briefly to MVFR through the morning hours. Guidance
hints that VFR conditions are likely to continue into the morning
hours on Saturday before MVFR conditions settle in in the afternoon
for a few hours. Improvement in the evening hours likely, however
ceilings are expected to trend MVFR in the early morning hours on
Sunday.

Gusty conditions are expected at the terminal as winds are
forecasted to pick on Saturday morning. Maximum wind gusts up to 30
kts are possible. Winds will eventually begin to decrease on
Saturday evening. Southwesterly flow will transition to
southeasterly flow on Saturday morning.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong weather system off the coast of Washington will
bring a very active period on Saturday to Western Washington`s
waters. Winds are expected to peak through Saturday morning and
eventually subside throughout the afternoon. Currently Small Craft
Advisory winds for the West and East entrances of the Strait.
However, winds are expected to reach gale force by early Saturday
morning. Similarly, the waters in the Northern Interior and
Admiralty Inlet are expected to see gale for winds in the early
morning hours on Saturday. Winds in Puget Sound will stay within
Small Craft Advisory criteria. Gale force winds are expected along
the coast on Saturday morning, with gusts up to 50 kt possible in
the outer coastal waters. Winds are expected to gradually decrease
on Saturday afternoon.

As mentioned, winds are expected to subside into the afternoon hours
on Saturday. However another strong system will begin to impact the
coastal waters on Monday bringing winds that fall under Small Craft
Advisory criteria. Guidance hints at additional systems moving over
the coastal waters, bringing more gusty winds and active conditions
over the waters.

The strong system on Saturday will generate waves between 18 to 25
ft. Waves should gradually begin to decrease on Saturday afternoon.
By Sunday waves will decrease to below 10 ft. Waves look to increase
again on Monday with the system moving over the coastal waters, with
heights being around 8 to 12 ft. Waves will remain above 10 ft as
additional weather systems are expected to move over the waters next
week.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>.We`ll remain wet today as rain and showers are in
the forecast. Latest guidance still has been uncertain regarding
rainfall amounts in the Olympics, with overall totals being a
touch higher than previous forecasts. Area rivers will still rise,
with only the Skokomish River being expected to reach near action
stage. Even with the slightly higher QPF amounts, the Skokomish
River still is forecasted to barely reach action stage today.
This will continued to be monitored as more guidance becomes
available. Additional rounds of precipitation could keep the
Skokomish river at or near flood stage into early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
