Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
258 PM PDT Tue Jun 10 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak upper trough will approach Western Washington
on Wednesday then settle over the area into early next week. This
will lead to cooler temperatures, increased cloud cover, and
occasional chances for mountain showers and coastal drizzle.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The air mass over western
WA is a little cooler today as the ridge overhead flattens. Highs
so far are mostly in the 70s to lower 80s. Onshore flow is
keeping the coast cooler and in the 60s.

Weak troughing develops over the region on Wednesday while a
deep low sets up over the Gulf of AK. Across western WA, onshore
flow will bring stratus clouds farther inland and into portions of
the interior during the early morning. There`s a slight chance of
showers in the north Cascades, near the crest, Wednesday
afternoon. Otherwise, the rest of the area will be dry.

The trough is a little deeper over WA on Thursday as the parent
low off SE Alaska drifts south. Onshore flow will be stronger for
overall cloudier and cooler conditions across the board, with a
few showers expected. Highs on Thursday are in the 60s to lower
70s. The coast may see some morning light rain or drizzle with
afternoon showers mainly in the Olympics and north Cascades.
Expect similar conditions on Friday as low continues to spin
offshore. 33

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Onshore flow continues
through the weekend while an upper level low stalls and spins
offshore. Temperatures will track close to average with highs in
60s to lower 70s. There`s a chance of showers Sunday night and
Monday as the low shifts east and inland. Troughing over the
region keeps showers in the forecast moving toward midweek. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft across this region this
afternoon ahead of a weak upper trough approaching the area. This is
maintaining light onshore flow that will increase a bit through the
evening. Generally clear skies across the area this afternoon save
for few bands of passing high clouds. Slightly stronger onshore flow
Wednesday morning will bring a push of marine stratus into portions
of central Puget Sound for a few hours between 12z-18z. Outside of
the stratus, generally clear skies will continue.

KSEA...VFR under clear skies through the day today. Northwest
surface winds will persist into the evening at around 6 kt, before
returning to southwest after 06z tonight. A push of low stratus
likely brings a few hours of IFR conditions arriving after/around
12z, with clearing toward 16z.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure remains offshore through much of the
week, building eastward into the coastal waters late in the week.
Will continue the small craft advisory for the coastal waters due to
seas remaining generally 8 to 12 ft over the coastal waters (largest
over the outer coastal waters) with dominant periods remaining
around 10 seconds. With the persistent northerly winds, expect seas
to remain elevated and choppy over the outer coastal waters through
much of the week. Winds will also remain in the 20 to 25 kt range
beyond around 30 nm from shore through the next few days.

Meanwhile, expect diurnal westerly pushes through Strait of Juan de
Fuca each afternoon and evening through the week ahead. The
strongest of these is likely to be Wednesday evening, and a gale
watch remains in effect for the central and eastern Strait zones.
Latest guidance continues to suggest around a 50% chance of gales in
these zones.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
