.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper low off the Washington coast early this
morning will drift slowly south through Friday for continued
cool, unsettled weather. The upper low will move inland Friday
night and Saturday for additional precipitation. An upper level
ridge will build over the area Sunday then weaken Monday. Troughing
north of the area Tuesday with a building ridge expected Wednesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The weather for Friday and
Saturday continues to look wet with near record cold high
temperatures.

Satellite imagery shows upper level low off the Washington coast
early this morning. Showers rotating around the low along the
coast with isolated showers over the interior from about Seattle
northward. Under cloudy skies temperatures at 3 am/10z were in the
mid 50s to lower 60s.

Upper level low will slowly drift south today ending up off the
Central Oregon coast late this afternoon. Southerly flow aloft
over the area. With the low not moving eastward same scenario
today as we have seen for the last 24 hours with the majority of
the shower activity west of the Puget Sound. Air mass slightly
unstable and will become a little more unstable with some daytime
heating increasing the chances for showers over the interior this
afternoon. Models continue to put the thunderstorm chances in the
15 to 25 percent range with the better chances along the coast.
Cloudy skies most of the day will keep highs in the 60s and lower
70s.

Upper level low stationary off the Central Oregon coast
tonight keeping the same scenario intact with the main bands of
moisture rotating around the low remaining west of the Puget
Sound. With the somewhat unstable air mass chance of showers still
in the forecast for the entire area with a threat of thunderstorms
over the Cascades. Lows tonight in the mid 50s to lower 60s.

Low slowly moving east Friday. This eastward movement will push
the next band of moisture rotating out of the low over the
interior instead of mostly confined to the coast. Shower chances
increasing for the interior and the Cascades during the day.
Cloudy skies and showers will keep high temperatures well below
normal, in the upper 50s to mid 60s.

Upper level low moving inland Friday night then kicking northeast
into British Columbia Saturday. Deformation zone on the back side
of the low setting up late Friday night into Saturday morning.
Right now the models have this feature over the central and
northern portions of the interior. Deformation zones can be tough
to pinpoint well in advance. As the low dissipates over British
Columbia the deformation zone will weaken over the interior. This
type of pattern can result in record low maximum temperatures this
time of year especially with the zone in the area for most of the
day. For now have worded the forecast as showers likely Friday
night then rain in the morning and showers likely in the afternoon
for Saturday.

The cool temperatures Friday and Saturday will suppress the
thunderstorm threat both days.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Models and ensembles in
better agreement this morning with an upper level ridge building
over Western Washington Sunday and the first half of Monday.
Onshore flow both days will keep highs down with mid 60s to lower
70s Sunday and upper 60s to upper 70s Monday. The ridge weakens
later Monday into Tuesday as a weak shortwave moves by to the
north bringing a chance of showers to the northern half of the
area Tuesday. Highs cooling back into the mid 60s to lower 70s.
Models are hinting at a stronger upper level ridge building
beginning Wednesday returning the area to more August like weather
with some 80s possible by the end of the week. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low off the coast will continue to dig
southward across the region today before pushing inland Friday
morning. South/southwesterly flow will continue aloft. A few rain
showers continue across the interior early this morning, but the
majority of the shower activity has remained along the Pacific coast.
Guidance generally showing a brief lull in shower activity from
late morning into this afternoon, before another round of showers
moves north this evening into the overnight period. This currently
looks to mostly impact terminals south of the Sound and along the
coast. Conditions this morning are VFR across the interior and
MVFR along the coast. Expect ceilings to become more widespread
MVFR between 12-15Z this morning and to generally lift back up
towards VFR between 18-20Z. Shower activity moving up in the
evening may briefly bring conditions back down to MVFR/IFR at
times. Isolated thunderstorms will be possible, however confidence
is too low to include mention in TAFs at this time. Winds
generally light and out of the SE, becoming light W/NW through the
morning hours. Another round of MVFR ceilings looks to develop
overnight into Friday.

KSEA...VFR conditions becoming MVFR between 12-15Z. Winds
generally SE at 3-6 kt, shifting to the W/NW between 15-18Z.
Conditions look to improve back to VFR this afternoon, however
MVFR conditions look to return during the overnight period into
Friday. Isolated showers will be possible at the terminal tonight.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A low pressure system will continue to trek southward
through the coastal waters today. The low looks to make it into
the OR waters by this afternoon, allowing for winds to gradually
transition to more westerly. Rain showers and chances for isolated
thunderstorms will be possible at times through the day and could
bring lightning, gusty winds, and lower visibilities in heavy
rain to portions of the area waters at times. Westerly winds will
increase along the Strait of Juan de Fuca this afternoon and
evening, but generally look to persist below Small Craft criteria
at 10-20 kt, with only occasional gusts to 25 kt expected.

Additional systems look to move across the area waters over the
weekend and look to bring the potential for stronger onshore flow.
Small craft advisory strength westerlies will be possible along
the central and eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca Friday night into
Saturday. High pressure will then rebuild into the coastal waters
by early next week and looks to bring generally benign conditions.

Seas will primarily persist at 3-6 feet across the coastal waters
through the weekend and into early next week. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
