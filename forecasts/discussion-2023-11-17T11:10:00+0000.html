Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
610 AM EST Fri Nov 17 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure will remain in control today, followed by a cold
front pushing through Friday night into Saturday morning while
low pressure passes well offshore. High pressure then builds
from the west and southwest for the weekend. Another high
pressure system builds in from the Great Lakes Sunday night
into Monday, then moves offshore Tuesday. A frontal system
approaches the local region from the west Tuesday. The
associated warm front moves across Tuesday night with the
central low moving across early Wednesday. The low strengthens
and moves towards the Canadian Maritimes Wednesday into
Wednesday night. High pressure will start to build back into the
area towards Thanksgiving of next week.

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Areas of mainly patchy dense fog this morning, especially for
eastern locations in CT, and patchy fog generally further west
across rural locations. The fog will burn off by mid morning
with any visibility restrictions coming to an end.

A SW to S flow of milder air moves in today in advance of a cold
front which remains off to the west today. Initially expect just
some high clouds, but clouds increase into the afternoon with some
mid levels clouds advancing in from the west. Dew point readings on
the SW to S flow should manage to get into the 50s in most locations
before the day is through. The day should remain dry as any lift
will remain elevated and weak. Temperatures today will run a good 6
to 10 degrees above normal with mainly lower and middle 60s for day
time maxes.

For tonight look for cloudy skies with mild conditions. Temperatures
will be well into the 50s for much of the night, with only far NW
sections beginning to cool off towards daybreak as the cold front
begins to push into the region. Much of the evening hours looks dry,
but do introduce chance to slight chance showers across western and
northwestern sections.  After midnight is when most of the shower
activity takes place chance PoPs, and likely PoPs across portions of
northern sections. The rain is expected to be light with rainfall
amounts mainly under a tenth of an inch by Sat morning. The cold
front is expected to get into part NW sections towards daybreak
Saturday and should begin to bring an end to any rain / shower
activity across western sections as the leading edge of drier and
cooler air arrives.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
Behind the cold front Saturday morning the pressure gradient
increases quickly and with steeper lapse rates look for the winds to
gust by mid morning and into the afternoon. Gusts are likely to
approach 30 mph across all zones on a N to NW wind. Dew point
readings will fall quickly through the day and eventually get down
into the 20s, especially further west for the late afternoon.
Temperatures should get into the 40s by day`s end despite a good
deal of sunshine.

High pressure to the WSW will continue to build through Saturday
night and on into Sunday with predominantly clear skies. The winds
will gradually diminish Saturday night. It will likely feel about 5
to 10 degrees colder with the wind at times during Saturday evening,
with the winds lighter later at night. As the air mass modifies a
bit on Sunday temperatures will return to seasonable levels with a
good deal of sunshine, but it will be brisk on a westerly breeze.

&&

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...
Northern branch of upper jet moves farther north of the region.
Strong large width of more southern branch of upper jet strengthens
and moves into the area for early to mid next week. This will bring
more amplified synoptic pattern into the region.

The strengthening frontal system approaches Tuesday with its triple
point low moving across early Wednesday. A lot of warm air advection
will make this a primarily rain event. Rain could be heavy at times
especially Tuesday night into Wednesday morning. Winds also increase
rapidly Tuesday night into early Wednesday. Potential for wind gusts
of 35 to 50 mph. There could still be model run fluctuations easily
of plus or minus 5 to 10 mph.

Temperatures overall below normal except for Tuesday night and
Wednesday.

&&

.AVIATION /11Z FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
Low pressure begins to approach the area from the south today with a
cold front approaching from the west. The cold front will pass
through the area Saturday morning, while a strengthening low tracks
well to the east.

Mainly VFR through today for NYC terminals, KHPN, and KSWF, but IFR
or less at times in stratus and fog for KISP, KBDR and KGON
overnight into this morning. After 14Z this morning, all terminals,
including those in Southern CT and Long Island, return to VFR.

For tonight, MVFR conditions likely develop at KSWF towards 06Z-08Z
Saturday in rain.

Winds will be either light S/SW, or light and variable, then pick up
out of the S/SSW after 12Z-13Z this morning. Some gusts upwards of
20kt are possible late morning into the afternoon. Winds will
gradually diminish this evening into overnight.

 ...NY Metro(KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Patchy ground fog possible toward daybreak. Brief MVFR to IFR
possible.

OUTLOOK FOR 09Z SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...

Saturday: MVFR or lower in -RA early, improving to VFR by afternoon.
NW winds G20-25kt.

Sunday: VFR. W winds G20kt.

Monday: VFR.

Tuesday: MVFR/IFR or lower likely in RA, mainly afternoon and night.
SE winds G30-40kt.

.MARINE...
For today a southerly breeze increases through the late morning and
early afternoon. The western ocean and western nearshore waters will
be hovering near small craft gusts at times. Held off on a small
craft for now as gusts appear that they will be too occasional, but
a brief period of small craft gusts cannot be ruled out for these
zones.  Otherwise expect sub small craft conditions to prevail
through tonight with a cold front approaching from the west into
Saturday morning. The front should push through from west to east
Saturday morning. Immediately behind the boundary the winds will pick
up out of the N and NW. Gusts are expected to get to 25 to 30 kt for
all waters.  At this time gales are not anticipated. Low pressure
passing well SE on Saturday will help generate a swell that`s
expected to help push ocean seas above 5 ft starting Saturday
afternoon and continuing through Saturday night. Thus SCA conditions
are expected on all waters Saturday afternoon as an offshore flow
strengthens and becomes gusty behind the departure of the developing
offshore storm. Elevated seas will continue through Sunday with at
least marginal small craft conditions at times on the nearshore
waters.

SCA gusts are expected on some of the waters Sunday night into
early Monday. Then sub-SCA for the rest of Monday through
Monday night. SCA conditions probable, especially across the
ocean Tuesday. Widespread gale force gusts Tuesday night possible.
Gale force gusts possible Wednesday also. SCA gusts forecast
Wednesday night.

.HYDROLOGY...
There are no hydrologic concerns through Monday.
