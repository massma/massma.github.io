Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure rebuilds over the region Tuesday and
Wednesday with warming temperatures and dry conditions. Another
front on Thursday will cool temperatures briefly, but a return
of warmer and dry conditions is expected to return late in the
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>This morning`s
front as pushed through the region rather quickly and other than
slightly cooler temperatures over this time yesterday and a few
lingering showers in the Cascades, you might not know it. High
pressure begins to rebuild tonight and Tuesday with an upward
trend in temperatures expected. Thermal low pressure builds
north up the coast and east inland over Western Washington on
Wednesday with widespread temperatures into the 80s for much of
the interior lowlands Wednesday afternoon. This corresponds to
Moderate (Orange) HeatRisk for portions of the region, and
likely the warmest temperatures so far this year for many. With
the warm temperatures, keep in mind that water around the region
remains quite cool, so continue to be mindful of safety practices
near the water.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A front will cross the
region early Thursday in what looks to be a repeat of today.
That is, additional clouds, cooler conditions, and some light
rain will move across Western Washington. However, this will
again be just a brief pause, as high pressure will again build
later in the week. At this point, expect abundant sunshine and
temperatures remaining above normal for Friday and Saturday.
Confidence decreases late in the weekend through early next week
as ensemble guidance begins to display a wider range of
potential solutions. Another disturbance or two may attempt to
move into the region, but on the whole expect mostly dry
conditions and temperatures near to above seasonal normals.
