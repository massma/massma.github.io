Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
312 PM PDT Sat Sep 28 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Drier conditions as southwesterly flow aloft
continues. A subtle trough will enter western Washington tonight
into Sunday increasing precipitation chances. An upper level
ridge will set up to start the new week, however a series of
troughs will influence the pattern. A frontal system looks to
arrive on Friday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/... <span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft
across the area as a trough axis resides offshore. Downstream, an
upper-ridge is dominating the Rockies and Four Corners region.
Here locally, conditions are currently dry but KLGX is picking up
on echoes just offshore. Meager precipitation is expected if any
should fall out of this band of reflectivity. The mountains have
the best chance (15%) of seeing shower activity earlier in the
evening. For tonight, mostly dry weather is expected. Overnight
lows are to fall in the 40s.

Showers are again in the forecast on Sunday as the upper-trough
progress throughout the region. Any lingering precipitation should
end Sunday night as ridging builds in and hangs out into Monday.
Then, a low center is modeled to deepen in the Gulf of Alaska
Monday night into Tuesday. This feature will help flatten the
ridge and even reintroduce precipitation chances into Tuesday.

Highs are forecast to top out generally in the 60s but a few 70s
could return on Tuesday. Overnight lows will bottom into the 40s
but can`t rule out some upper 30s sneaking into the forecast
particularly on Sunday night in rural areas away from water
sources and the typical cold pockets.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...PoPs are to remain in
the forecast through midweek but are at this point still
unimpressive. The best chances reside within the northern half of
the CWA. Guidance remains in line with the arrival of a frontal
system entering the region on Friday. There remains some
differences on its exact track at this time but there is a
consensus on ridging redeveloping by Saturday.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A bit of a split flow situation is unfolding this
afternoon throughout the Puget Sound region, with variable to
southwesterly flow in the central and southern Sound, westerly
through the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and northerlies in the northern
Salish sea. Expect continued improvement in the ceilings this
afternoon to VFR, but not complete clearing. A weak front will push
through the region in the later afternoon, after 00Z. Outside of the
northern coast, no precipitation is expected. Onshore flow will
continue overnight for another round of stratus by Sunday morning. A
reduction in cigs and visbys throughout the Sound to MVFR is
favored.

KSEA...Model guidance has struggled to convey the wind pattern this
afternoon, but trends in the observations show an earlier turn
around to westerly and southwesterly flow at the terminal. Given the
weak front pushing through the area later this afternoon, a south to
southwesterly wind continuing isn`t unreasonable. This has been
reflected in the TAF. Cigs likely to stay VFR through late tonight
with upper level clouds remaining. The onshore component of the
winds will favor another round of stratus at the terminal on Sunday
morning, but guidance is suggestive of only a 25 percent chance of
cigs below 3000 ft through Sunday morning. That probability rapidly
decreases into the early afternoon as more sunshine is favored.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow will increase later today into tonight ahead
of a weak system moving into southern B.C. Light echoes are showing
up on the northern coast as of 21Z, but are not likely producing
meaningful precipitation. Small craft advisory westerlies in the
central/east strait this evening and overnight are still expected
and present headlines have not been adjusted. Northwesterlies will
also pick up over the coastal waters tonight, coupled with elevated
seas. The small craft advisory for the outer waters was extended by
a few hours to account for a slightly longer duration of stronger
winds and elevated seas.

Surface ridging offshore will expand into the inland waters late
Sunday into Monday allowing onshore flow to relax and perhaps turn
weakly offshore. A weak front will approach the area late Tuesday
into Wednesday for possible wind and sea related headlines over the
coastal waters.
