Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
1140 AM EST Sat Mar 2 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
Weak low pressure approaches from the south through this
evening. The low then slowly moves east of the area through
early Sunday morning followed by weak high pressure building
in. High pressure will remain in control through at least
Monday. A coastal low could then potentially approach from the
south on Monday night. Multiple areas of low pressure along a
frontal boundary move near the region mid to late week.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SUNDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mainly light rain continues to overspread the area from the
southwest. More organized thermal forcing arrives this
afternoon and will set up a localized area of frontogenesis.
This will allow for some of the rain to become moderate at
times.

The low may lift across southern portions of the area this
evening before departing towards Cape Cod overnight. The rain
should taper off from west to east the first half of tonight.
The flow behind the low is weak and there could be some patchy
fog in spots overnight.

Total rainfall amounts range from around a third of an inch
northwest to around an inch across eastern Long Island.

Temperatures today will rise into the 40s for most spots and
could touch low 50s this evening immediately ahead of the low.
Temperatures tonight will be mild and above normal, generally in
the 40s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT/...
Dry conditions are likely on Sunday, with an upper level
shortwave trough axis east of the area. The surface low will
also continue moving away from the New England coast. Heights
rise aloft and weak surface high pressure noses in from the
north. High pressure looks to remain in control through at least
Monday. Another weak low is forecast to approach from the south
Monday night, which may bring another round of rain to the
area.

Temperatures in the 50s are expected Sunday and Monday, with lows
in the mid 40s.

&&

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
Upper level jet is displaced well north of the region Tuesday into
Tuesday night. Upper level jet streak develops farther south near
the region Wednesday into Thursday with a subtropical jet moving
north towards the area late in the week.

In the mid levels, local area is on the western side of ridge with
two shortwaves passing by. These are accompanied by surface lows
traversing near the area as well. Timeframe for the shortwaves
and lows, Tuesday into Tuesday night and then Wednesday night
through early Friday. The stronger low and shortwave with more
dynamic forcing appear to be with the second one within the
Wednesday night through early Friday timeframe.

Gusty easterly winds and rainfall forecast through much of the
period will make for a maritime airmass to develop across the
region. Temperatures overall are forecast to be above normal with
less diurnal differences.

&&

.AVIATION /18Z SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
Low pressure approaches today and moves southeast or over Long
Island tonight.

Rain will be more periodic and intermittent this morning before
becoming more steady going into this afternoon and this evening.
Rain tapers off late tonight from west to east.

MVFR to IFR in rain today will gradually improve west to east
late tonight into early Sunday to mainly MVFR. There will likely
be some localized LIFR conditions from time to time this
afternoon and tonight.

SE to E winds near 10 kt today will eventually become more
northerly tonight into early Sunday without much change in wind
speed.

There is potential for some low level wind shear going into
early this evening with SE winds near 40-50 kt at 2kft.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

MVFR and IFR timing could be a few hours off from TAF. There
could be some fluctuation between categories.

OUTLOOK FOR 15Z SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...

Sunday: Gradual improvement to VFR. Chance of MVFR or lower at
night, especially outside the NYC terminals.

Monday: Slight chance of rain east of NYC terminals afternoon into
early evening. Increasing chances of rain across entire area at
night. MVFR to IFR possible.

Tuesday: Chance of rain. MVFR to IFR possible.

Wednesday: Chance of MVFR or lower at times in rain. E-NE winds G15-
20kt developing at night.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Have pushed up the start time of the SCA on the ocean to 4 pm as
winds will be increasing to near SCA levels in stronger S flow.

A weak low pressure approaches this afternoon and moves over
the waters this evening. The low passes east of the area
overnight into Sunday morning. Winds will reach marginal SCA
levels this afternoon on the ocean as S flow increases, This
will continue for the first half of tonight. Ocean seas will
build through this evening, mainly due to a longer period SE
swell. These long period swells are likely to persist into
Sunday. Winds on the waters will remain below SCA levels late
tonight through Sunday night. Ocean seas will slowly subside,
falling below 5 ft sometime late Monday through Monday night.

Winds are forecast to be mostly below SCA Tuesday until
Wednesday night. That is when much of the ocean is forecast to
have SCA level wind gusts. Concerning the seas, non-ocean waters
are forecast to be below SCA thresholds but ocean waters are
forecast to be in SCA range much of the time. Wavewatch
indicates some contribution potentially from long period
easterly swell.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
Anywhere from 0.30-1.00" of rain, highest eastern Long Island
and southeast CT, is expected from this morning through
tonight. No hydrologic impacts are expected today through Monday
night.

Widespread rainfall forecast mid to late week. Heavy rain potential
with potentially above climo precipitable waters moving in with each
low. Still lots of uncertainty depending on track and timing of low
to determine any specific impacts at this time beyond that of minor
flooding in the poor drainage and low lying areas.
