Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
324 AM PST Fri Jan 10 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough will continue to push into the
Pacific Northwest today, bringing in breezy winds alongside
lowland rain and mountain snow. Convergence zone showers will set
up over the central Cascades tonight, with continued showers
lingering through the weekend under moist northwest flow. Drier
conditions are forecast to return next week as high pressure
rebuilds over the western US.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system will
continue to move inland this morning and sweep across the Pacific
Northwest throughout the day today, bringing in lowland rain and
mountain snow alongside breezy post-frontal onshore winds. Snow
levels will fall to 3000 ft by late Friday, resulting in snow
accumulation through Snoqualmie and Stevens Passes. Confidence is
high that Puget Sound Convergence Zone showers will form over the
central Cascades later today into early Saturday morning which
will locally enhance snowfall amounts. Latest model guidance
shows roughly 7 inches of snow through Snoqualmie Pass and 11
inches through Stevens Pass enhanced by convergence zone shower
activity, and a Winter Weather Advisory remains in effect through
early Saturday morning.

Lower elevations will see drying throughout the day Saturday, with
lingering snow showers over the Cascades under moist northwest
flow aloft. Snow levels will dip to roughly 2000 ft, though any
additional snow accumulation amounts on Saturday will be light.
The rest of the region will see cloudy skies with some afternoon
sun breaks and highs in the mid to upper 40s.

As high pressure rebuilds offshore, a ripple in the periphery of
the ridge will move southward across the region on Sunday morning,
maintaining light showers over higher terrain. Conditions will
clear out by the afternoon, giving way to mostly sunny skies and
slightly cooler highs in the mid 40s.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Long range models continue
to favor high pressure building over western Washington through
much of next week, allowing for drier and warmer conditions. Weak
forcing and residual moisture will likely allow for rounds of low
stratus and patchy fog around the Puget Sound lowlands early
Monday and Tuesday mornings with mostly sunny skies returning
each afternoon. The ridge is favored to break down towards the end
of next week as moist zonal flow returns, but significant impacts
are not expected with this pattern change.
