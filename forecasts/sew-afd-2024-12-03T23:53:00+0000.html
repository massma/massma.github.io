Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
353 PM PST Tue Dec 3 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure aloft will maintain dry conditions with cool
overnight temperatures, morning fog and low stratus through
Wednesday evening. The upper level pattern will begin to shift
Thursday into Friday as the next storm system approaches, bringing
widespread precipitation across the region through the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The persistent upper level
ridge over the region will remain in place through Wednesday,
maintaining the status quo of dry and stable conditions with
widespread morning fog and low stratus with pockets of greatly
reduced visibility possible again overnight. Cold overnight lows
will also give way to the development of freezing fog in areas
that fall below freezing overnight, primarily south of the Puget
Sound. Lows will again dip to  near freezing across the lowlands
including the Cascade valleys and highs Wednesday will rise into the
upper 40s to lower 50s.

The large scale pattern is expected to shift Thursday as an upper
level trough moves into the Pacific Northwest, displacing the
persistent upper level ridge. This weak system will allow light
rain to move into western Washington late Wednesday night into
Thursday morning, perhaps more importantly it will also boost
mixing in the boundary layer and limiting fog into Thursday
morning. On Friday a warm front will lift across the region,
bringing even more widespread rainfall and a warmer air mass -
boosting snow levels to near 7000-9000 ft. Temperatures Friday
will peak well into the 50s across the lowlands.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Warm frontal precipitation
will continue into Saturday morning. A trailing cold front will
follow closely behind on Saturday as an upper level trough settles
over the region, bringing in more precipitation and lowering snow
levels to 3000-3500 ft by Saturday night. The deterministic
precipitation forecast from 06z Saturday through 06Z Sunday -
capturing both the heavier warm frontal precipitation and expected
accumulations from the cold front is highlighting over 3 inches in
portions of the North Cascades. This has trended towards the
wetter portion of the ensemble distribution somewhere near the
80th percentile mark. Given that the area has been relatively dry
for the last week or so, this will be a noticeable shift to more
typical Pacific Northwest Fall weather. Showers are expected to
continue into Sunday under the trailing upper level low, with
orographic enhancement over the Cascades and snow levels at or
below pass level. Ensembles and medium range models continue to
highlight a shift back to a drier, more benign patter early next
week with high pressure aloft and northerly flow aloft.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Conditions have improved across the terminals to VFR
conditions. Another round of widespread fog is expected to fill into
the majority of the terminals after 1Z bringing IFR/LIFR conditions
for Wednesday night/Thursday morning. Some guidance suggests that
KCLM and KBLI may remain MVFR/VFR as guidance hints at lower
probabilities for decreased visibilities. Conditions should begin to
improve after 21Z to VFR. The exception being KOLM, as they may
improve to MVFR.

KSEA...Currently under VFR conditions at the terminal as visibility
has improved and ceilings have scattered. However, this improvement
will be temporary as fog is expected to develop again tonight after
1Z and LIFR conditions will be established Wednesday night/Thursday
morning. Winds will be from the north/northeast, however guidance at
this time indicates that winds will be light. Similarly to today,
model guidance has the fog beginning to lift around 21Z (20%) into
VFR conditions on Wednesday afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Another round of fog is possible tonight into Wednesday.
Visibilities may decrease below 1 NM. Light winds will keep waves
between 5-8 ft. A series of storm systems are expected to move
through the area beginning on Thursday, followed by a stronger
system on Friday. Southerly flow will allow for steep seas to
develop before waves build with the Friday system. Stronger winds
and westerly/northwesterly winds will help waves build between 14-17
ft on the coastal waters during the weekend. Waves should gradually
begin to subside on Monday.

Currently there are no advisories out for the coastal waters,
however ensemble guidance does hint at winds possibly reaching Small
Craft criteria on Friday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper ridge will remain in place across Western
Washington through Wednesday. A frontal system will move through on
Thursday for lighter QPF amounts. Another weather system Friday into
Saturday is forecast to bring heavier QPF amounts. In addition, snow
levels are expected to rise later Friday into early Saturday to 7000
to 9000 feet. This, combined with rainfall, will result in rises on
rivers across Western Washington. At this time, the Skokomish River
is the main river of concern for potential river flooding during
this period. There is a fair amount of uncertainty as to the highest
amounts of rainfall that are possible with Saturday`s storm, with
some models producing over 4 inches over the Olympics and Central
Cascade north.  This could drive some rivers to close to or over
minor flood. Due to this and the higher snow levels Friday into
Saturday, other area rivers will need to be monitored for flood
potential as well.
