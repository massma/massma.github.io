Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
105 PM EST Thu Mar 6 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
A cold front moves through the area this morning. Associated low
pressure gradually departs to the northeast through Saturday night,
with another cold front swinging through Saturday morning. High
pressure will then be in control for the rest of the weekend and
into the first half of next week.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Fog has lifted across the area, and clouds are diminishing
somewhat. Where clouds have scoured out a bit, temperatures have
risen to the upper 50s, especially across Long Island. Clouds
have moved back into the picture across Long Island, and thus
don`t think temperatures will rise any more than they have,
especially with a northwesterly flow developing behind the cold
front.

Low pressure passes through the Great Lakes and drags a cold front
through the area this morning. The associated upper level trough
axis will lag behind several hours as it becomes negatively tilted
and likely passes through late this evening. With another area of
low pressure trying to spin up just to our north today, the pressure
gradient remains relatively weak through at least the morning. Once
the low makes it a bit farther east this afternoon and evening, the
W/NW flow starts to pick up.

The heaviest showers are now east of the area. There remains
potential for isolated to scattered showers through the day today
with cyclonic flow aloft.

With the strong CAA not kicking in right away, the area should be
able to warm up to the 50s today.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT/...
The pressure gradient tightens tonight as low pressure gradually
exits to the northeast. The area stays well mixed tonight through
Friday, with winds increasing aloft. Model NAM and GFS soundings
show mixing up to at least 850mb for an extended period of time,
with 50+ kt at this level. HREF mean also shows deep mixing,
with multiple hours tonight showing 40+ kt max momentum transfer
and 50+ kt on Friday. NBM and NBM90th percentile guidance was
too low given the potential, so went with a blend of NAM 900mb
winds and NBM90th to get several hours of widespread 40 to 45 kt
gusts. Isolated gusts up to 50 kt can not be ruled out. A Wind
Advisory is now in effect everywhere from 6 PM this evening
through Friday afternoon. There will be a lull in gusts Friday
night, but with deep mixing again on Saturday there will likely
be 30 to 35 kt gusts.

Mostly dry in this short term period, but with a weakening system
approaching from the west and another cold front passing through
there is potential for some brief rain and snow showers Friday
night/early Saturday morning.

&&

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
High pressure remains in control of the weather Sunday through
Wednesday. With that said, a weak low and trough pass to our
north on Monday, but likely far enough away to have no impacts
here. A gradual warmup occurs during this period with highs on
Sunday near normal in the mid to upper 40s, then eventually
getting well into the 50s and 60s on Wednesday.

&&

.AVIATION /18Z THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure builds back into the area behind a departing cold.

Mainly VFR. A pocket of MVFR ceilings dissipates this afternoon.
Improvement to VFR could be possibly as late as 21Z at KGON,
otherwise VFR prevails through the period.

Gusts gradually ramp up in W flow behind the departing cold front,
increasing to 30-40kt tonight. Expect some gusts over 40 kt later
tonight and into the first half of Friday.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Amendments may be needed around the magnitude of wind gusts, with
some uncertainly around maximum gusts late tonight into the first
half of Friday.


.OUTLOOK FOR 18Z FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY...

Friday Afternoon: VFR. W winds 15-22G30-40 kt, a few peak gusts up
to 40 to 45 kt early. Winds subside evening / night.

Saturday: VFR with W winds G15-20 kt possible.

Sunday - Monday: VFR.

Tuesday: Mainly VFR, SW-S winds.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The Dense Fog Advisory continues for the extreme eastern sound
zone and the eastern ocean zone, where fog remains persistent
and generally relegated to near shore, as is seen at some of the
beach cams across the south fork of Long Island. Therefore, the
Dense Advisory extended until 2 pm.

Gale conditions have ended for now, but will return this evening
through Friday with 40 to 45 kt W/NW gusts. Before that, SCA
conditions continue on the ocean for elevated seas and also for
the NY Harbor, South Shore Bays and western LI Sound as they
will see a period of 25 kt gusts this afternoon before the Gale
Warning.

There will be a lull in gusts Friday night, with 5+ foot seas
continuing on the ocean. By Saturday, gusty conditions return, with
just shy of gale conditions likely as of right. Confidence is not
high enough for a watch or HWO mention at this time.

Thereafter, sub-SCA conditions are expected.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Although the area saw 1-2 inches of rain on Wednesday, windy and dry
conditions Friday and Saturday will allow for an increased risk in
fire spread. Both days will see min RH values around 30 percent.
Gusts on Friday are expected to reach 45 to 50 mph, with gusts on
Saturday around 30 to 35 mph.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
There are no hydrologic concerns through the middle of next
week.
