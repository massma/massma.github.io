Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
253 PM PDT Fri Mar 14 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Additional systems entering tonight through Monday
will keep lowland rain, steady mountain snowfall, and
occasionally breezy conditions in the forecast through the weekend.
Drier, benign weather is expected early next week before active
weather returns midweek.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The first of two weekend
systems will brush western Washington this evening, bringing
widespread lowland rain, mountain snow, and breezy/gusty
conditions during the day Saturday for many areas. In addition
there will likely be enough instability with an upper level short
wave sliding past overhead during the day to support a chance of
isolated thunderstorms especially along the coast and interior
south of Puget Sound. HREF probabilities for isolated lightning
during the day range from 40-70% along the coast.  Widespread
showers will continue into Sunday as the the broader upper level
trough moves over the area, perhaps supporting a similar if not
more widespread chance of thunder again Sunday.

Snowfall in the mountains will continue through the weekend and
into the first half of next week with snow levels in the 2000 to
2500 foot range dipping to closer to 1500 feet Monday. Higher
snowfall rates Saturday into Sunday will raise accumulations in
the Cascades, and a Winter Storm Warning remains in effect.

High temperatures across the interior will remain in the upper
40s to lower 50s through the weekend, with lows in the upper 30s
dipping into the mid 30s to kick off the week.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...A showery pattern Monday
will likely trend drier into Tuesday and possibly Wednesday before
active weather pattern looks to return with the grand ensembles
hinting consistently at a wetter patten returning during the
latter half of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>VFR across the western Washington terminals this
afternoon with increasing mid level clouds. An upper low will move
inland to the south of the region tonight, with showers and low end
VFR to MVFR conditions spreading northward this evening through
Saturday and transitioning to MVFR/IFR by Saturday morning. A front
will lift northward across the region Saturday morning into the
early afternoon, generating breezy SW winds 10-20 kt with gusts to
30-35 kt alongside shower activity. Shower activity will continue
Saturday afternoon with small hail and locally gusty winds possible
in stronger showers that develop. Models show a slight chance (10%
to 15%) of isolated thunderstorms developing on Saturday, but
confidence is not high enough to include at any of the terminals.

KSEA...VFR this afternoon with E/NE winds and increasing mid level
clouds. Light shower activity with low end VFR/brief MVFR will
spread northward over the terminal this evening with MVFR rain
filling in throughout Saturday morning. Winds shifting SE this
evening will shift southerly and increase after 12z with gusty S/SSW
winds strongest between 15z-20z Saturday. Forecast models show a
moderate (40% to 50%) chance of wind gusts reaching 35 kt at SEA as
the front moves through. A lightning strike or two also cannot be
ruled out on Saturday near the terminal, but confidence is low.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface low over the Oregon offshore waters will
gradually weaken as it slowly moves inland, allowing a brief break
in marine headlines this evening. Small Craft level onshore flow
will develop over the outer waters and through the west and central
Strait of Juan de Fuca on Saturday as the low moves inland and a
front lifts northward over the region. This will also generate
southerly SCA winds across the Puget Sound and Hood Canal waters on
Saturday. Weak troughing will remain over area waters into Monday
before a surface ridge builds across the waters into Tuesday.
Another front is on track to cross the coastal waters towards the
middle of next week.

Combined seas will ease to 8 to 10 feet this afternoon and evening
before rising to 10 to 15 feet throughout the weekend. Seas will
gradually ease heading into next week.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Forecast precipitation through the weekend has come
down somewhat with the significant amounts expected well to the
south of the area. There remains a small chance of the plume of
deeper moisture shifting northward, and have left the ESF over
Mason County in effect. Non-the-less, precipitation over the
southern Olympics this weekend will result in rises on the
Skokomish River. Current projections bring the Skokomish River
into action stage early Sunday. While other rivers will
experience rising water levels, river flooding is not expected
elsewhere over the next 7 days.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
