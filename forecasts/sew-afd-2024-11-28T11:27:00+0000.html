Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
327 AM PST Thu Nov 28 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Isolated light showers and areas of fog continue this
morning. A weak weather system on Friday will bring cooler air
and light precipitation to portions of the region. High pressure
builds over the region this weekend, maintaining drier conditions
through early next week. Another front likely reaches the area
around midweek.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Rather persistent pattern
in place for another day as high pressure is beginning to
establish itself across the eastern Pacific, with a few weak
disturbances riding the top of the ridge through southeastern
British Columbia. These will be the focus for a bit of enhanced
lift enough to maintain a few light showers across the northwestern
portions of the area early today, but these won`t be much in the
way of moisture down to the surface. The bigger story for this
Thanksgiving morning will be the fairly extensive fog and low
stratus across the majority of the lowlands. A dense fog advisory
is in effect through mid-morning for much of the area and those
heading out early this morning will want to give some extra time
for travel and be prepared for restricted visibility this morning.
With a drier northerly flow aloft developing today, expect
showers to taper and mostly confined to the coastline (though
can`t totally rule out a few elsewhere) and a mix of sun and
clouds in the afternoon after the morning fog.

A weak disturbance will slide south on Friday, bringing an
increased focus for some additional light showers and some cooler
air into the region. Accumulations will be quite modest outside of
some of the higher peaks of the mountains, and given this, travel
impacts are not expected. High pressure continues to rebuild over
the northeastern Pacific late Friday and will shift eastward into
Saturday. With the strengthening inversion, expect a mix of shallow
fog and low clouds each morning, and perhaps some increasing
clouds with the region transitioning to more northwesterly flow,
depending on where the ridge axis becomes established. Regardless,
overnight lows the next few nights will begin to dip a few degrees
cooler with some of the more outlying locations dipping into the
lower 30s.                                                  12

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...The start of next week
still looks to be dominated by a ridge of high pressure over the
region, with strong support in the ensemble guidance. Confidence
begins to decrease a bit with respect to the amplitude and a
positioning of the ridge, with most ensemble members maintaining
it firmly in place and around 20% shifting it enough to open the
door for a return of westerly flow and some higher potential for
showers to return. With this uncertainty remaining larger into the
midweek period, it`s worth noting a shift that the next front with
a deeper plume of moisture may begin to reach into the Pacific
Northwest. Meanwhile, temperatures trend near or slightly above
normal for the first half of next week.                      12<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow aloft as an upper level ridge builds
across the northeast Pacific and into western Washington. South and
central Puget Sound are filling in with thicker fog early this
morning, with visbys ranging from one eighth of a mile to one mile.
Some passing mid and upper level clouds over Snohomish county and
north is limiting some of the fog development, and those cigs remain
MVFR to VFR at this time. That said, there is still enough surface
moisture and light enough flow for there to be some fog development
in these areas. It may develop in place, or continue to be brought
up from the area of fog developing in Puget Sound. For the locations
that will remain in the fog the longest, a breakout time is not
expected prior to 18Z. Additionally, given that the ridge is more
established over the area, there is likely going to be another round
of fog and lower cigs tonight, setting in generally after 00Z to
03Z.


KSEA...Dense fog is presently overhead and will remain that way
throughout much of the morning hours. One-eighth of a mile
visibilities and RVRs of less than 1000 feet will likely persist
before sunrise. Light northeasterly flow of 3 to 5 kt likely
throughout the majority of the TAF period. Sunrise won`t bring
immediate reprieve from the fog, but visibilities will climb subtly
to a quarter mile. Appreciable improvement is not likely before 18Z.
The high resolution model guidance is struggling to resolve the fog,
and given the pattern, the probabilities of seeing IFR to LIFR cigs
are far too low. Unrestricted visibilities and a return to cigs of
3000 ft are more likely after 20Z.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will continue to dominate over the coastal
waters through the rest of the week and into the weekend. A weak
system will just clip the region to the north on Friday for light
chances of precipitation. The next system to move through the area
does not look to arrive until early next week. Fog has developed
early this morning, namely throughout central Puget Sound and
Hood Canal, which will limit visibilities over the waters.
Redevelopment of the fog is likely this evening. Winds remain
light northwesterly across the coastal waters through the week,
becoming southerly this weekend. Seas 2 to 4 ft through the week,
increasing to 6 to 8 ft this weekend as long period swell arrives
to the area from a system over Alaska.
