National Weather Service New York NY
917 PM EDT Fri Oct 25 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
A cold front will move across the region late tonight into early
Saturday morning. Another large area of high pressure building
in for the weekend. A back door cold front will move through
from the north late Sunday night into Monday morning, with high
pressure building in its wake out of eastern Canada Monday into
Tuesday. The front will lift back to the north as a warm front
Tuesday night as the high sets up off the Southeast coast. A
weakening cold front should pass through on Friday.

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SATURDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Forecast on track. High pressure will continue weakening tonight
as a cold front approaches. The front should move through early
Saturday morning. Only expecting an increase in mid and high
level clouds with conditions remaining dry. Overnight lows will
be just above normal. Cold advection then sets up toward day
break with the passage of the cold front.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM SATURDAY MORNING THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT/...
Despite the cold front, temperatures will not be that much
cooler than Friday, with highs a few degrees above normal.
However, a gusty northwest flow develops early in the morning,
with gusts 25-30 mph. Low relative humidity and gusty winds
will also elevate the spread of wildfires. See Fire Weather
section below.

&&

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
High pressure will build from the west on Sunday beneath weakly
cyclonic flow aloft courtesy of a broad upper trough and closed
low over ern Canada. A shortwave trough digging into the base of
the longer wave feature will push a back door cold front
through late Sunday night into Mon and maintain cool temps into
Mon night, with some frost inland each late night/early morning
til then as high pressure builds SE into the area. A return flow
on Tue as the high passes to the southeast should bring some
moderation in temps back to a few degrees above normal.

A significant warming trend expected for mid to late week as a
warm front passes to the north and a Bermuda high sets up off
the SE coast. High temps will be in the 70s from Wed through
Fri, and may approach 80 in spots in urban NE NJ and in some
interior valley spots.

Dry wx should continue through the period. An approaching front
may bring slight chance of a shower inland late Thu night.
Latest ECMWF looks a little more robust with fropa but its
rainfall amts are sill rather light, with less than 0.1 inch for
most of the area.
