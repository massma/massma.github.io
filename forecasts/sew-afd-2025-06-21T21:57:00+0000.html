Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
257 PM PDT Sat Jun 21 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridging will build offshore in the wake of
the unsettled conditions today. This will foster warmer and drier
conditions Sunday through Tuesday. A weak front will cool things
off by midweek.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cloudy and cooler
conditions are expected to linger throughout the rest of the day
today. Highs across the area this afternoon have been in the mid
50s to low 60s. Twenty-four hour precipitation totals range from a
half to three quarters of an inch from the northern Olympic
Peninsula to the San Juan Islands. Similar totals have been
observed in the Cascades. Throughout the rest of Puget Sound, a
tenth to a quarter of an inch of rain has fallen. Considering that
this month is running quite behind on precipitation, this rain
was much needed. It doesn`t bring the totals up to normal for the
month, but is still better than not receiving rain in the context
of fire danger.

Ridging will build offshore tomorrow for highs to rebound into the
low 70s throughout Puget Sound and 60s along the coast. As the
ridge nears temperatures will steadily increase through Tuesday,
with Tuesday likely the warmest day of the week. High temperatures
will be in the upper 70s to low 80s, with weak onshore flow
continuing.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...A weak frontal system
will drop into NW WA on Wednesday and cool the temperatures off
back to the low 70s. Very light precipitation will be confined to
the north coast and areas north of Everett by Wednesday afternoon.
The parent trough will sag further into the area through the end
of the week, keeping precipitation chances in the forecast through
Thursday night. By Friday, isolated showers will be relegated to
the Cascades and partly sunny elsewhere.

Ensembles are favoring a ridge to be positioned more overhead by
next weekend, sending the temperatures back up to around 80
degrees. As always with significant lead time, these scenarios
will evolve.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Increasing northerly flow aloft as an upper level low
meanders over western Washington this afternoon. A mixed bag of
conditions out there this afternoon ranging from MVFR/IFR to
localized pockets of LIFR (KPAE) as lingering moisture keeps
ceilings low. Rain will continue to decrease in coverage into
early this evening (03-06z) where conditions will likely improve
across the area to VFR/MVFR. S/SW winds will continue into Sunday
morning, where another in the round of MVFR clouds can be
expected.

KSEA...IFR conditions continue this afternoon as lingering
showers are keeping ceilings and visibilities low. This activity
will decrease into the early evening (03z-06z) as conditions
begin to dry out across the terminal, rebounding to MVFR/VFR. With
lingering moisture across the area, can not rule out MVFR
remaining throughout the evening. S/SW winds through Sunday
morning 4 to 8 knots. Latest guidance highlights a 40% chance of
low MVFR clouds Sunday morning (08z-14z).

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure will exit eastward from the area, with
elevated northwest winds over the coastal waters this afternoon. A
Small Craft Advisory remains in effect until early Saturday
morning for the combination of wind and seas. Surface high
pressure will build offshore on Sunday with generally benign
conditions over the area waters. Onshore flow will also increase
periodically throughout the first half of the week, resulting in
westerly winds through the Strait of Juan De Fuca.

Combined seas 8 to 10 feet this afternoon will slowly subside
below 10 feet this evening. With a period of 8 to 9 seconds, can
expect choppy seas in the outer coastal waters into Sunday
morning. Seas will continue to decrease to around 4 to 6 feet
later Sunday into Monday.
