Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
213 PM PST Fri Dec 27 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An active weather pattern will continue across Western Washington
the next few days, but with no significant high impact weather
expected at this time. Increased mid level heights through
Saturday suggest warmer than normal temperatures, but this will
give way to temperatures dropping back to near normal fro Sunday-
Tuesday. This will be as a trough brings lower heights to the
area. However after Tuesday the trend is for increasing heights as
ridging looks to develop over the Western US. This will favor
warmer than normal temperatures into the start of the New Year. 35<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A northward lifting front across the South Sound is bringing an
increase in temperatures and moisture as southwesterly winds pick
up behind the front. This will set the stage for some breezy
conditions overnight, but expected to remain below wind advisory
levels. With a brief lull in precip this afternoon, the radar
already shows the precip shield from the next system already
overspreading the Coastal areas. This will march steadily east
overnight. A breezy and wet night is expected across the lowlands.
Snow will pick up again over the Cascades. The Advisory for winter
weather continues with generally around 3-6 inches falling
overnight, and snow continuing into Saturday morning. This will be
generally from about 3700 feet and above with the increased low
level warmth from southwesterly flow. Elsewhere, rainfall will
not be significant enough to produce impacts across the lowlands
and winds while breezy, should not reach to advisory thresholds.

The surface low will be weakening as it pushes into Vancouver
Island on Saturday. While showers will persist over the mountains,
it will be generally becoming less damp throughout the day
Saturday. With the continued southwesterly winds, temperatures
will remain above normal and near 50 degrees in most lowland
locales. Pops will remain lower through early Sunday before
climbing again ahead of an approaching front. Cooling aloft will
bring more accumulating snow over the mountains as well as a
possibility of coastal thunder by later Sunday.

Monday should be a few degrees cooler and closer to normal highs
for late December. It should also be a generally dry day for most
areas with no system impacting the area through the day.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
On Tuesday it will remain near normal with a weak surface high
pressure overhead. A more significant Pacific low pressure will
start to help force ridging in the mid levels over the West Coast.
Tuesday has a good chance of being a dry day across the region as
well, outside of some increasing rain chances by evening in
coastal areas. However the next system will be slower to approach
the area and so rain chances will not significantly increase until
Wednesday for most of the area. This will bring a return of breezy
and wet conditions with temperatures above normal. Currently it
looks like a more significant system may impact the area by
Friday as a deeper surface low over the eastern Pacific is
suggested from late Friday and into the weekend. 35<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A low pressure system continues to bring a warm front
across Western Washington this afternoon. The warm sector has made
it up to Puget Sound, where mist has dropped visibilities down to 2
SM, with ceilings down to around 500 ft at times. Once the front
clears out this afternoon, CIGs and VIS will increase back up to 4
to 6 miles and 1,000 to 2,000 ft respectively. A trailing occluded
front has begun to trigger showers just off the Pacific Coast. These
showers will spread inland Friday night into Saturday. Initial
coverage will be more widespread, but will scatter out later on.
Winds will also begin to pick up out of the southwest later this
evening into Saturday, with winds peaking Saturday morning.
Soundings show uniformly southwest winds at the surface (and aloft),
which should limit directional wind shear concerns. However, peak
gusts will still reach 20 to 25 kt for most terminal sites for a
good chunk of Saturday morning. The winds will diminish Saturday
evening. Expect the CIGs/VIS to remain in MVFR categories through
the day Saturday.

KSEA...Conditions are improving - terminal will break out of IFR
ceilings into MVFR this afternoon, with visibilities in between 4
and 6 miles (mist). Next round of showers will arrive by around 00Z,
and will linger through Saturday. Cannot rule out brief drops to IFR
with the shower activity, but otherwise MVFR conditions are expected
into all of Saturday. Southwest winds will begin to pick up just
after 00Z - expect them to peak around 12-18Z Saturday morning with
sustained winds around 15 kt, and frequent gusts of 25-30 kt.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface low pressure system is located just offshore
this afternoon, with an occluded front off the coast, and a warm
front over Puget Sound. Rain showers are expected to continue over
all waters tonight into Saturday (brief visibility reductions due to
mist are likely). Breezy southwest winds will develop in between the
fronts this evening into Saturday, which is expected to peak at 20-
25 kt sustained, and 30 kt in gusts (isolated gale gusts to 35 kt
are possible). Behind the front, west winds down the Strait of Juan
de Fuca are expected. Small craft advisories have been expanded to
include all waters, and are timed for when the most impactful winds
will arrive between now and Saturday evening. The advisory for the
coastal waters will likely continue into the whole weekend (due to
seas increasing up to 18 to 22 feet Saturday, decreasing down to 8
to 10 feet Sunday into Monday).

Going into next week, a weak system will pass through Sunday into
Monday. The only concern with this system is seas remaining at 8 to
10 feet (steeper seas in the outer coastal waters). A stronger
atmospheric river-style system middle of next week will likely bring
gusty winds and increasing seas above 10 feet. HPR<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Several systems will track across western Washington,
including one tonight, one Sunday into early Monday, and a
potentially wetter system Wednesday into Thursday, with the active
pattern continuing into late week. Currently the Skokomish is the
only river in flood and forecast to remain in flood stage through at
least this weekend. The Chehalis river will be closely monitored as
it reaches action stage, but is forecast to crest below flood stage
early next week. A break in the rain will allow rivers to relax
Monday into Tuesday before a wetter period begins late week with 3
to 5 inches possible over the Olympic Peninsula, putting pressure on
Olympic area rivers once again by late next week. 62<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
