Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front will move across Western Washington
bringing rain and gusty winds this afternoon. Isolated light
showers Friday and Saturday. Conditions will dry out starting on
Sunday with high pressure building over the area and persisting
into late next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Radar imagery shows rain
moving across Western Washington as a cold front continues to push
inland this afternoon. The latest observations show gusty winds
already impacting the region. Winds will begin to ease late this
evening into tonight. The strongest winds will be along the coast
and the northern interior, where gusts above 40 mph are likely.
Isolated gusts exceeding 45 mph (40-50% chance) are possible along
the coast and northern interior. In addition, SBCAPE values
80-100 J/kg may promote the development of some thunder this
afternoon. There is a 15-20% chance of thunder for the northern
Cascade foothills and locations north of Everett. Everywhere else,
has around a 10% chance. The lowlands will see around 0.10-0.20
inches of rain, with higher localized amounts in the Cascade and
Olympics (0.40-0.80 inches). Behind the cold front, scattered showers
will remain possible. The latest model runs hint at convergence
zone developing north of I-90 late this evening into tonight.

Snow levels will hover around 5000-6000 ft this afternoon at the
passes. Therefore, any snow accumulations with this system will be
limited to the higher elevations. Snow levels will decrease late
tonight into Friday down to 3000-3500 ft, and by Saturday they
will decrease to around 2500-3000 ft. A trough lingering over the
area will keep showers in the forecast on Friday and Saturday.
This system will bring lowland rain and mountain snow. Snow
accumulations in the passes will will be light (1.00-3.00 inches),
and rain accumulations across the lowlands will be 0.10 inches or
less.

An upper level ridge will build offshore on Saturday. It will move
onshore on Sunday and dry out the region. High temperatures will
generally be in the 50s through the weekend, with each day
gradually becoming warmer. By Sunday, some locations may see highs
in the low 60s. Low temperatures will become colder into the
weekend; temperatures will be in the low 40s on Friday. By
Saturday and Sunday, low temperatures will be in the 30s to low
40s, with colder temperatures across the southern interior (low-
to-mid 30s). The combination of mostly clear skies and light
winds overnight may promote the development of patchy frost across
the southern interior.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...There is general agreement
between long-term ensemble guidance that an upper level ridge will
persist into Monday. The ridge will weaken on Tuesday as a
shortwave through pushes through the region. Current model
guidance shows that precipitation will be limited to British
Columbia and northern Cascades. Upper level ridging will rebuild
over the Pacific Northwest on Wednesday and Thursday. There is
some disagreement in the ridge axis location and strength among
ensemble models; however, a general upper level ridging pattern is
favored.

High temperatures on Monday will be in the low to mid 60s.
Temperatures will slightly decrease on Tuesday to the 50s to low
60s and will remain through Thursday. Low temperatures will
generally be in the low-to-mid 40s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mainly MVFR as a frontal system crosses western
Washington this afternoon, bringing a band of rain and breezy SW
winds up to 30-35 kt. Winds will gradually ease into the evening
hours with ceilings improving to high end MVFR/low end VFR behind
the frontal passage. Scattered showers will develop behind the
front, with the highest confidence over convergence zone shower
activity developing north of the Puget Sound through Friday morning.
More widespread MVFR ceilings may develop early Friday morning but
confidence is low.

KSEA...Rain and breezy SSW winds will continue through roughly 02z
as a frontal system pushes inland. Brief MVFR ceilings and lower
visibility will develop as a narrow band of heavier showers passes
over the terminal. Conditions are favored to rebound to VFR behind
the frontal passage and precipitation with breezy winds tapering off
throughout the evening hours. Probabilistic guidance still hinting
at a 25-35 percent chance of MVFR cigs developing at the terminal
again by early Friday with potential for convergence zone showers to
drift south after flow turns northerly by 18z Fri.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system will continue eastward across the area
today, bringing gusty southerly winds to the majority of the area
waters. A Gale Warning remains in effect for the coastal waters with
frequent gusts to 40 kt. Winds across the interior waters will
remain breezy into the evening before easing. Thus, SCAs remain in
effect for the interior waters from the Puget Sound waters up to the
Canadian border. A push of westerly winds down the Strait of Juan de
Fuca will also yield small craft westerlies in the wake of the front
into Friday morning. Winds will then ease on Friday as high pressure
starts to build back over the northeastern Pacific.

High pressure will persist over the coastal waters through the
weekend. Guidance then hints at a trough extending northward along
the Washington coast by early Monday. Should this come to fruition,
this would allow for winds to briefly turn offshore on Monday.
Offshore winds will be short-lived, however, as high pressure over
the northeastern Pacific builds back over the coastal waters by
Monday evening. A frontal system may clip the waters early next
week as it moves inland to the north, but does not look to bring
much impact to the area at this time.

Seas over the coastal waters persisting at 4-6 ft morning will
build towards 9-11 ft today and remain at this range into Friday.
Seas will subside towards 4-6 ft again over the weekend and hover
between this range into early next week.
