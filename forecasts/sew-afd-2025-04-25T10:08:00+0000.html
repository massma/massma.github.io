Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
308 AM PDT Fri Apr 25 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure in place through today. Diverging flow
aloft over the weekend will keep conditions dry through the
weekend, but chances for precipitation increase early next week.
Expect dry and warmer conditions to return by the middle of next
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A near repeat of yesterday
appears to be the story for today, with clear skies and highs in
the low 70s throughout Puget Sound, with upper 50s to upper 60s
along the coast. Coastal locations as well as the Strait of Juan
de Fuca may see some stratus later in the morning, but it doesn`t
appear to be long lived.

The upper level pattern depicts a low pressure system moving into
California through the weekend, putting the PNW in divergent flow
aloft, while being still somewhat influenced by weak high
pressure. Slightly cooler temperatures will be in place over the
weekend, but will still be in the 60s. Sunday will see lower 60s
as onshore flow is more noticeable and more stratus returns.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...A system dropping out of
the Gulf of Alaska Monday night into Tuesday will be the next
chance of rain for western Washington. Snow levels aren`t expected
to dramatically drop, keeping a chance for light accumulations on
the higher ridges in the forecast. The return to wet conditions
isn`t long lived, as high pressure and warmer temperatures resume
by the middle of the week.
