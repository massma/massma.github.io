Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
243 PM PDT Tue Oct 8 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Off and on rain showers are expected through
Wednesday as weak disturbances move over the region. High
pressure will begin to build along the west coast late this week,
resulting in warmer and drier conditions by the weekend. Another
shift to cooler and wet weather is expected early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The front that brought
widespread rain to the area during the morning commute weakened as
dissipated as it cross the Cascades. A secondary area of showers
is pushing across the Olympic Peninsula and north interior early
this afternoon. This feature will also dissipate and weaken as it
moves across the Cascades and there will be a break in the
precipitation by early Wednesday. However, right on it`s heels,
the next wave will lift northeast across the Pacific Northwest
bringing yet another chance for light precipitation, primarily to
the northern 2/3rds of the CWA Wednesday afternoon though
Wednesday night.

Longwave ridging is expected to develop along the west coast late
Thursday into Friday, resulting in drier conditions and the
beginning of a slow warm up.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The aforementioned high
pressure will continue to build through at least Saturday and
perhaps Sunday, allowing temperatures to continue to warm to above
normal (upper 60s and low 70s). The only wrinkle is a compact low
pressure system that is most likely to drift across Oregon under
the ridge which could complicate the forecast slightly.

By early next week, this ridge axis is likely to shift east of the
area and a longwave low pressure system will inch closer to the
west coast, opening the door once again for precipitation and
cooler weather. At this time, there is no signal for significant
weather impacts over the next 7-10 days.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West to southwesterly flow aloft as broad troughing
situates itself over western Washington. A mixed bag of conditions
out there this afternoon with MVFR throughout most of the
interior, with spots of IFR in localized spots such as KPAE, KPWT,
and KHQM. Rain showers will remain along the coast and in the
mountains this evening, which could cause some localized lower
ceilings at KHQM and KBLI. Ceilings will slowly rise this
afternoon to VFR across the region, before ceilings fall back down
to MVFR/IFR overnight and into Wednesday morning.

KSEA...MVFR conditions this afternoon at the terminal. Latest
guidance suggests a rebound to VFR later this evening, with a 20%
chance of staying MVFR into the overnight period. Low clouds and
MVFR/IFR will return late tonight into Wednesday morning. S/SW
winds will continue generally around 5 to 10 kts.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak front has exited the coastal waters this
afternoon with generally onshore flow in its wake. Generally
benign conditions across the waters, with another frontal system
crossing the area late Wednesday, but holding no wind or sea
impacts.

Seas will generally maintain 6 to feet through midweek, before
decreasing to 4 to 6 feet over the weekend.
