.SYNOPSIS...A building upper ridge will lead to warmer and
drier conditions across Western Washington through the end of
the week. A weak front will produce a few showers and cooler
temperatures on Memorial Day before upper ridging brings a
return to drier conditions and warming temperatures into the
middle portion of next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Dry conditions in
place across the region this afternoon with temperature into the
upper 50s to lower 60s. The building ridge in place will
maintain dry conditions through at least Sunday afternoon. A few
patches of fog can`t be ruled out Saturday morning, but overall
less extensive cloud cover expected tomorrow with the ridge
overhead. Expect temperatures for Saturday afternoon to reach
well into the 70s for much of the interior. The upper high
pressure will weaken a bit as the ridge axis shifts east on
Sunday, which will limit further warming as the onshore flow
begins to increase. A weak front crossing the area late Sunday
could bring a few showers to the coast by late evening.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The trailing upper trough
crosses the region into Monday, maintaining cooler and cloudier
conditions and knocking temperatures back down into the 60s. A
few showers are possible, especially in the mountains. However,
strong agreement in the ensemble guidance for a ridge of high
pressure quickly rebuilding over the Pacific Northwest. This
will bring temperatures well into the 70s for many again on
Tuesday and perhaps into the 80s on Wednesday. This will
correspond to minor HeatRisk across most of the region. Spread
in the guidance again increases late in the week with another
system approaching, but low confidence as to if the ridge holds
on over the area or if the next system can push through and
bring a return of cooler and cloudier conditions.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft turning southwesterly into Saturday
as an upper-level ridge builds. VFR tonight through much of the
upcoming TAF period. Patchy fog looks to develop early Saturday
morning, especially for areas adjacent and within river valleys
(KHQM) but should clear by 15-16z. SW surface winds 5-10 kt G 15 kt
will decrease to 2-5 kt overnight before increasing again Saturday
afternoon.

KSEA...VFR ceilings throughout the TAF period. SW surface winds 5-10
kt turning NW 4-8 kt between 00-06z Saturday, then lighter and
variable thereafter. SW winds return by Saturday afternoon. Mid-high
level clouds will track overhead.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure persisting over the waters through Saturday.
A front arriving Sunday night into Monday morning will help to
lessen its influence. This feature doesn`t appear to be strong
enough to produce headlines at this time. High pressure looks to
resettle Monday, possibly leading into midweek. Seas 2 to 4 ft then
increasing to 4 to 7 ft Sunday-Monday.
