Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
230 PM PDT Tue Jul 23 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level trough over Western Washington through
Thursday. The trough will move off to the northeast Friday. A
weaker trough will take its place over the weekend into the first
part of next week. Temperatures will remain near normal through
the period.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough and
onshore flow over the Pac NW will keep western WA near July
averages through the week. High temperatures will be in the 60s
and 70s with lows mostly in the 50s. The upper low may bring a few
showers to the coast and north part (near the Canadian border) on
Wednesday although lowland rainfall amounts will be light - just
a few hundredths (if anything). Showers will be more focused over
the North Cascades Wednesday night and Thursday as the upper low
tracks NE into northern Alberta. A weak trough lays over the
region into Friday with little to no moisture attached. 33

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The weekend forecast
remains seasonably mild with weak upper troughing and onshore
flow. Temperatures are right near late July normals. Stronger
onshore pushes may bring marine stratus clouds inland during the
overnight hours, with stratus burning back toward the coast during
the afternoons. A deeper trough may pass through western WA early
next week for another chance of showers (mainly coast and
mountains). 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West/southwest winds loft with a large upper level low
over British Columbia. In the low levels, flow remains
onshore/northwesterly 5 to 10 kt. Expect winds to decrease tonight
to mostly light and variable. Winds will switch to southwesterly
tomorrow. VFR conditions expected through the TAF period, except at
HQM where a push of marine stratus will bring a return to MVFR to
IFR conditions through the early morning hours.

KSEA...VFR conditions through the TAF period. NW winds to 10 kt
decreasing tonight, switching to SW early tomorrow morning.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure will remain offshore over the
eastern Pacific Ocean with low pressure inland, maintaining
northwesterly onshore flow.

Latest high-resolution ensemble guidance suggests around a 40-50%
chance of Small Craft Advisory winds early tonight through the
Central and Eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca. Frequent gusts up to 25
to 30 kt are possible, therefore will put a short-fused Small Craft
Advisory for these regions for tonight.

A stronger push is expected tomorrow evening with more solidly Small
Craft Advisory conditions through the Central and Eastern Strait, as
well as into Admiralty Inlet. Gusts up to near gale force are
possible, especially through the East Strait late in the day
Wednesday (50-60% probability), which has prompted a Gale Watch
Winds may also be breezy through the southern Strait of Georgia, but
not expecting anything reaching SCA.

Additional pushes on onshore winds are expected through the next few
days, which could yield additional headlines through the Strait of
Juan de Fuca at times.

Coastal seas 3 to 5 feet will generally remain through the rest of
the week.

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>We`re settling upon more benign fire weather
conditions than seen recently. Stout onshore flow and troughing
aloft will keep concerns to a minimum for the next several days.
Isolated pockets of critical RH values are possible in the Cascade
zones of 658 and 659 but, decent overnight recoveries are expected.
20-40% chance of showers overnight Wednesday into Thursday morning
for the Northern Interior with little to no chance of wetting rain.
