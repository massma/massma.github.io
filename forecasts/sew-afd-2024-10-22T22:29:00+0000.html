Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough stalled along the Pacific Coast
will slowly move inland throughout the week, maintaining cooler
conditions with periods of light shower activity through mid-week.
Weak high pressure will dry conditions out on Friday ahead of wet
and breezy conditions over the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Split flow aloft has
allowed for mostly clear skies this afternoon as a trough
continues to slowly retrograde offshore. Low level northerly flow
will allow conditions to continue drying out throughout the
evening hours with highs reaching 60 for some areas east of the
Puget Sound. A marine push will bring low stratus inland Wednesday
morning, with most lowland areas seeing low temperatures in the
upper 30s to lower 40s. Areas favored to see less in the way of
low stratus, including the Chehalis Valley and Olympia metro area,
will see patchy fog and could even see isolated areas of ice and
frost in colder spots.

Westerly flow aloft will increase throughout the day Wednesday and
push the upper level trough back onshore. While conditions are
favored to stay mostly dry, light shower activity will develop
over the Cascades and western Olympics by the afternoon.
Temperatures will dip a few degrees on Wednesday with highs in the
low 50s across the lowlands.

Weak upper level ridging will dry conditions out on Thursday,
though another round of low stratus in the morning will likely
keep most lowland overnight low temperatures above freezing. Highs
Thursday will peak within a few degrees of normal in the mid 50s.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...High pressure will amplify
into the region on Friday ahead of a deepening trough over the
Gulf of Alaska. Offshore flow will increase throughout the day
Friday, which may generate breezy easterly gap winds in the
Cascade foothills. Winds along the coast and through the Strait of
Juan de Fuca will also pick up as the next storm system
approaches.

Wetter conditions are on track to return by the weekend as a deep
upper level trough moves onshore. Forecast models continue to show
potential for periods of breezy winds alongside several rounds of
precipitation. Preliminary rainfall totals show potential for 2 to
4 inches of rainfall over the weekend and into early next week
over the Olympic Peninsula and Cascades, while the lowlands could
see an additional inch or two of rain. Unsettled and cooler
conditions are favored to continue into early next week with
additional troughing over the region.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft will become more southwesterly
with split flow overhead. Conditions have generally rebounded to
VFR area-wide this afternoon. The VFR trend will continue through
this evening, before low clouds/fog develop again overnight into
early Wednesday, likely bringing MVFR to IFR conditions to area
terminals by 12Z. Low clouds and fog will scatter by 18-21Z for a
return to VFR conditions. Surface winds generally light,
persisting at 4-7 kts out of the north and west. Winds will
transition to southerly again overnight into early Wednesday.

KSEA...VFR conditions to persist through this evening. Low stratus
looks to move into the terminal Wednesday morning, likely by 12Z.
Fog and low stratus to scatter between 18-20Z. Northerly winds
4-6 kts transitioning to the south by 12Z. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will continue to build into the area
waters tonight and will persist into Friday. Patchy dense fog will
be possible across interior waters Wednesday morning and may
briefly bring some reductions to visibility at times through the
morning hours. A strong area of low pressure will move into the
coastal waters Friday night into the weekend and will bring a
sharp increase to offshore flow Friday into Saturday and likely
widespread marine headlines across the area waters. Offshore flow
will transition to onshore Saturday, with a push of westerly winds
expected down the Strait of Juan de Fuca in the wake of the
frontal system.

Seas currently hovering between 4-6 feet this afternoon will
continue to subside to 3-5 feet by Wednesday. Seas then look to
persist at this range into Friday, before increasing to 12-14 feet
over the weekend. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
