Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
242 PM PDT Sat Jul 27 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Generally pleasant conditions across the region into
Sunday. A weather system will bring cooler conditions and
widespread rain chances to the area Sunday night and Monday before
tapering off Tuesday. High pressure builds during the latter part
of the week with temperatures rising back to several degrees
above normal by the end of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Generally quiet across
western Washington this afternoon. Marine stratus has eroded back
to the coast, otherwise just some high cirrus and some minimal
haze in the sky. Thus far, convection has been limited to areas
east of the North Cascades crest, but there is still a slight
chance that a shower or two pop up during the afternoon.

Expect generally dry conditions Sunday with increasing clouds
during the day as a wet frontal system approaches the area. This
system will be associated with a decent moisture tap (for July)
and widespread measurable rainfall is likely Monday.
Precipitation totals on the order of a tenth to a half inch are
possible in the lowlands, with slightly higher totals possible in
the mountains. This level of rain will temporarily help the
wildfire fuels situation across western Washington, but likely
won`t have a lasting impact for the fire season.

Precipitation will taper off Tuesday, becoming limited to the
mountains. Temperatures will recover several degrees with
sunbreaks emerging later in the day.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...High pressure will build
across the west again Wednesday through at least Friday. This will
allow temperatures to once again ramp up to several degrees above
normal by late in the week resulting in areas of moderate/orange
HeatRisk. At this point in time, the highest temperatures are
expected either Friday or Saturday, but uncertainty lies in the
details of the pattern evolution by the weekend.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest flow aloft with subtle ridging upstream. VFR
for all airfields with the exception of KUIL and KHQM as both are
under marine stratus. Low clouds are to remain along the coast today
before spreading inland overnight into Sunday morning. Widespread
MVFR to IFR is likely before gradually burning off into the
afternoon-early evening on Sunday.

KSEA...VFR for the remainder of the day. W/SW surface winds between
5 to 10 kt. A push of marine stratus appears likely into Sunday
morning and arriving between 08-12z. Stratus will maintain in the
morning before burning off into the afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure remains offshore with lower
pressure inland. Marine stratus will persist throughout the period
with restrictions to visibility a possibility across marine zones.
Low level onshore flow will increase this evening, with a small
craft advisory in effect for the Central and Eastern Strait of Juan
De Fuca through early Sunday morning. A decent front for this time
of the year looks to enter on Monday, but with no threat of headline
worthy winds.

Coastal seas 4 to 6 feet will continue throughout tonight before
easing to 3 to 5 feet on Sunday and generally remaining that way
throughout the week.
