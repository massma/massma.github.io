Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
218 PM PDT Mon May 5 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will lead to dry and warming conditions through
Tuesday. A weak system will arrive by Wednesday bringing cooler
temperatures and chances for showers. Somewhat warmer and
generally dry conditions return late week before another front
approaches the region over the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Ridging aloft has resulted in mostly clear skies across the
region this afternoon with just some cirrus along the northwest
coast. Temperatures as of 1pm have risen into the low to mid 60s
on their way to the upper 60s to around 70 later this afternoon.
Warming will continue into Tuesday with highs peaking into the
mid 70s to around 80 across much of the region.

By Tuesday night into Wednesday, the next trough will move into
the region, ushering in cooler onshore flow and widespread but
brief chances for showers. Any precipitation will wane Wednesday
night.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Thursday into early
Saturday will see a general transition from troughing to weak
ridging across the area. This will allow conditions to dry and
warm slightly, though no where near as warm as Tuesday. By later
Saturday, confidence begins to diminish as an upper level trough
approaches the region. At some point in the late Saturday-Sunday
time frame this trough will spread precipitation east across the
western Washington. Compared to yesterday, cluster analysis
shows slightly better agreement in limited instability Sunday.
That said, there is some indication that the trough could hang
on a bit longer into early next week, keeping chances for
showers going.
