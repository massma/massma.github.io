Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
255 PM PDT Thu May 15 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cool, cloudy and a chance of rain through Friday as a
frontal system moves in. An unsettled weather pattern will remain
in place across the Pacific Northwest this weekend through early
next week, maintaining widespread clouds and rain showers.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Precipitation is spreading
inland this afternoon with light rainfall accumulations expected
(less than 0.10"). Moist, westerly onshore flow continues on
Friday for cloudy and cooler conditions. Forecast highs are only
in the 50s or similar to today. Rainfall is mostly along the
coast with isolated/scattered coverage inland.

The weekend weather is wet and unsettled as a trough and trailing
upper low slide through. The air mass is slightly unstable on
Saturday with a chance of afternoon/evening thunderstorms (mainly
near the Cascades). Snow levels are low on Sunday, around
3500-4000 ft, and may see light snow in the mountains (inch or
less). 33

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...A ridge moves inland late
Sunday and early Monday for a brief break in the weather.
Temperatures rebound slightly with highs in the lower 60s. A
quick-moving front clips through western WA later Monday for more
showers and windy conditions, especially along the coast. Onshore
flow prevails moving forward, leading to cloudy conditions and
near to slightly cooler than normal temperatures. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West to northwest flow aloft will continue as a weak
upper trough and associated frontal system approaches Western
Washington. Ceilings will lower to MVFR in light rain at times this
afternoon then persist across the region overnight into much of
Friday as the system moves onshore.

KSEA...VFR ceilings will lower to primarily MVFR in scattered
showers 22Z-00Z. These conditions will then persist overnight and
continue through much of Friday. Surface winds S/SW 7 to 10 knots.

27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak frontal system will approach the area then
dissipate as it moves onshore on Friday. Surface ridging will
rebuild offshore on Saturday then shift into the coastal waters
early next week. This will lead to increasing onshore flow and
likely headlines for the coastal waters and strait. Another frontal
system looks to move through the area on Monday. Seas will generally
remain under 10 feet through the forecast period. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
