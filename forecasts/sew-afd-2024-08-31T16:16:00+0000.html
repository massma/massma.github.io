Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
916 AM PDT Sat Aug 31 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Upper-ridging will remain in place through the
weekend. Here, we`ll see more summer-like conditions. A transient
trough will reintroduce showers into the forecast early next week
along with a cool down. However, additional ridging is slated midweek
onward as temps trend warmer.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper-ridge continues
across the PNW and the rest of western US. Not a cloud in the sky
given current satellite and large-scale subsidence holds. Current
temperatures sit in the upper 50s to upper 60s. High temperatures
will generally remain 5-10 F above average today for late August.
Light offshore flow with aforementioned ridging will help top
values into the 70s along the coast and areas adjacent to the
inland waters. The interior is expected to range throughout the
80s and lower 90s with the hottest spots within Cascade valleys
and Chehalis River valley. HeatRisk levels will reach the
Moderate/Orange category across much of the region with isolated
Major/Red within the aforementioned valleys. Overnight lows are
to range between the mid 50s to lower 60s.

Temperatures are still on track to cool down on Sunday as the flow
switches onshore. Coastal areas should see the return of more
seasonal conditions however, temps across the interior will remain
elevated as 80s and a lesser chance for 90s continue. Warm
conditions continue over the mountains. Models continue to hint
at an upper-trough looming offshore that`ll bring not only a
widespread shot of cooler weather but PoPs look to become
reintroduced into the forecast on Monday. A slight chance for
thunderstorms must be expressed with the best chance right now
over the Cascades. Temperatures are forecast to drop upwards of
10-15 F across the interior as the upper-low positions over the
PNW.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The low will be over the
Inland Northwest by Tuesday as ridging returns here locally. This
will result in warm and dry conditions returning during the
middle portion of next week. However, the duration of warm and dry
conditions is uncertain. Cluster analysis shows significant
differences in the potential patterns by late next week, ranging
continued ridging and warm and dry weather to incoming troughing
that`ll result in cooler weather.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Western Washington will remain on the back side of an
upper level ridge through Sunday. Westerly flow in the midlevels
will become more southerly tonight and more southwesterly on Sunday.
Offshore flow will persist in the lower levels and will
transition to onshore on Sunday.

Satellite showing mostly clear skies across western Washington
this morning, with a few spots of patchy fog in the lowlands east
of Puget Sound. Stratus with ceilings below 500 feet continues to
push northward along the coastline. All terminals VFR this morning
and expect this trend to continue through the day. Low stratus
will make up most of the coastline early Sunday morning and looks
to push inland into coastal and southwest interior terminals.

KSEA...VFR conditions. Northerly winds 6 to 10 knots with the
strongest winds late afternoon/early evening hours. Winds will
ease again overnight.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Thermally induced low pressure along the coast
during the morning hours will shift inland during the afternoon
and evening hours today then shift east of the Cascades Sunday.
Increasing onshore flow Sunday with high pressure over the coastal
waters. The onshore flow pattern will continue into Tuesday.
Another thermally induced trough will try and move up the coast
Wednesday.

Small craft advisory westerly winds likely in the Central and
Eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca Sunday evening and Monday evening.

Seas over the coastal waters will generally persist between 3-6
feet into Sunday. An uptick in seas is possible over the outer
coastal waters on Sunday into Monday, however expect seas to
subside back to the 3-6 ft range again by Monday night and to
persist within this range through midweek.

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper-level high pressure will promote warm and
dry conditions through the weekend. This, combined with offshore
flow in the low levels will allow for relative humidity values to
drop into the 15-20 percent in the southern portions of the
Washington Cascades and mountain valleys. Winds may locally be a
bit breezy as it funnels through the valleys. Relative humidity
recovery overnight will struggle to get above 50-60% in the
morning. Conditions will also become unstable over the region
during the afternoon this weekend, which would meet critical fire
weather criteria.

Area fuels, however, largely remain moist from recent rains,
mitigating the impact of the critical fire weather conditions.
Fuels will continue to dry out quickly, however, and it`s possible
that ERCs will exceed the 90 percentile and bring the possibility
of Red Flag conditions over the weekend. Several zones are
approaching if not meeting the 90th percentile as of this morning,
which we will continue to monitor.
