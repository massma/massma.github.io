Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
855 PM PDT Mon Jun 23 2025

.SYNOPSIS...A drying and warming trend is expected to continue
through tomorrow. By midweek, weak systems will begin to move
through the area bringing light rain and cooler temperatures to
most. A warming trend is in store for the coming weekend.

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mostly clear skies continue across the region this
evening. No major changes were made to the forecast below (just an
update to the aviation section).

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...The skies have mostly
cleared up for a pleasant afternoon, with temperatures in the
region largely in the mid 60s to low 70s. Slightly warmer
temperatures are expected tomorrow as the offshore ridge nudges a
little closer to the coast. Temperatures in the mid to upper 70s
are expected. Westerly winds will pick up slightly on Tuesday
afternoon ahead of a weak shortwave trough that will arrive on
Wednesday.

By midweek, the pattern changes to reflect the influence of a
series of shortwave troughs that will move through the region into
Friday. Rain is likely to begin early Wednesday morning, with a
noticeable cool off into the 60s. Cloudy skies and shower activity
will persist throughout the day. Flow aloft looks to become more
zonal on Thursday for continued shower activity (though likely
more focused in the Cascades).

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Friday will feature the
beginning of a weekend drying and warming trend as showers taper
off. A more focused ridge will begin to build and increase the
likelihood for warmer temperatures into next weekend. By Sunday,
the influence of the ridge will be more noticeable as the
temperatures climb steadily into the low 80s, even the upper 80s
in the Southwest Interior. A degree or two of warming further is
expected on Monday as well. Details on the exact temperatures are
forthcoming as more information becomes apparent.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level flow turns southwesterly tonight as an upper
level ridge over the area exits the region and an upper level
shortwave approaches. Expect VFR conditions to continue this evening
with streaming high clouds overheat. Stratus will push inland along
the coast again overnight, but does not look to make it into the
interior past the South Sound at this time. MVFR conditions will be
possible in morning stratus, with conditions likely improving back
towards VFR throughout the morning hours. Winds generally out of the
W/NW at 4-8 kts this afternoon will ease overnight and transition
back to the S/SW in the morning, likely between 15-18Z.

KSEA...Variable high clouds but otherwise VFR conditions will
continue tonight. Northerly winds ease late this evening, with light
southwesterly winds Tuesday morning.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...Mostly light winds will persist across the waters
tonight as high pressure builds into the coastal waters from the
northeastern Pacific. Onshore flow will continue over the next
several days, with westerly pushes expected down the Strait of
Juan de Fuca each evening. The push on Tuesday evening looks to
bring the next round of small craft headlines to the central and
eastern Strait, with probabilities currently indicating a 50-70
percent chance of gusts exceeding 25 kt.

A weak frontal system will move into the waters on Wednesday,
causing winds across the majority of the area waters to transition
to the south. High pressure building back over the waters late in
the week and into the weekend will allow for winds to shift back
to the north and approach small craft strength at times.

Seas will generally persist between 3-5 ft across the coastal
waters through much of the week.
