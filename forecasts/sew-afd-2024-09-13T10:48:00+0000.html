.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
mostly cloudy skies over Western Washington early this morning
with a small break in the clouds over the Southern Puget Sound.
Temperatures at 3 am/10z were mostly in the 50s with upper 40s
around Olympia.

Weak upper level ridge over the area will shift into Eastern
Washington by late morning. Upper level trough moving down from
the northwest still over the British Columbia coast by late
afternoon. Showers out ahead of the trough spreading over the
northwest portion of the area in the afternoon with the best
chance for showers along the north coast. With all the cloud cover
highs will be 5 to 10 degrees below normal, in the lower to mid
60s.

Upper level trough arriving tonight with shower activity
increasing in the evening hours then tapering off overnight. Lows
in the mid 50s.

Trough remaining overhead over the weekend with a closed upper
level low forming in the trough. Somewhat organized vort lobe
moving through Saturday afternoon will enhance the shower activity
into Saturday evening. The trough will begin to drop south Sunday
with pops decreasing throughout the day. The air mass will remain
somewhat unstable keeping at least a slight chance of showers in
the forecast Sunday afternoon. Highs both days remaining well
below normal, in the lower to mid 60s. Mornings will definitely
have a touch of fall in the air with lows in the mid 40s to lower
50s.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement with short term upper level ridge moving over Western
Washington Monday making it the driest day in this forecast
package. Front moving down the British Columbia coastline arriving
Tuesday night with rain out ahead of the front Tuesday afternoon.
Jet diving south behind the front will split and weaken the system
as it moves inland Tuesday night but not enough to keep at least
likely pops in the forecast. Trough behind the front moving
through Wednesday keeping showers in the forecast. Operational
models trying to build an upper level ridge Thursday. Ensembles a
little weaker with this feature and still have a small number of
solutions with light precipitation due to a shortwave moving by to
the north. Will keep a slight chance of showers in the forecast
Thursday but if the trends continue look for the Thursday forecast
to dry out in later packages. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest flow aloft today as a transient ridge moves
through the region. The ridge will be east of the area tonight
allowing a transition to westerly flow. Onshore flow will continue
in the low levels.

A mixed bag of cigs this morning as terminals range between VFR to
IFR criteria. Low stratus will become widespread as the morning
progress with MVFR/IFR cigs being the general trend. Conditions will
improve and return to widespread VFR between 18-20z Friday. An
additional round of low stratus is in forecast to arrive again
overnight Friday into Saturday.

KSEA...MVFR cigs currently at the airfield and will remain
throughout the morning. A 30% chance of IFR cigs exists, mainly
within the 13-17z timeframe. Any lingering stratus should lift to
VFR by 18-20z. Light winds becoming SW 5 to 10 kt today. More low
stratus again overnight into Saturday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure will continue over the coastal
waters today. Onshore flow expected to persist over the next several
days. A weak surface low will sink southward and move into British
Columbia Friday into the weekend. This will push a weak cold front
through area waters Friday night into Saturday. Increased onshore
flow will maintain another round of gusty westerly winds through the
Strait Saturday night into Sunday. High pressure then looks to build
back over the coastal waters Sunday-Monday, before another system
moves into the area waters on Tuesday.

Seas generally between 3-5 ft through the weekend before increasing
towards 5-8 ft over the outer coastal waters Sunday night into
Monday.
