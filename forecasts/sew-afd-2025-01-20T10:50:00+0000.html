Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
250 AM PST Mon Jan 20 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will dominate the weather into the
middle of this week, bringing dry conditions and cold overnight
temperatures. Lows will fall below freezing over much of Western
Washington at least into mid-week while daytime highs will remain
below normal.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Clear skies over much of W
WA this morning via satellite imagery allowing for some very cold
temperatures to emerge. Lower 20s present over some locations such
as Shelton and Arlington while on the higher end of the range, mid
30s are present in Everett and at Sea-Tac. The majority of remaining
obs falling somewhere in the middle. Given this wide spread of temp
range, it is difficult to get a feel for how current Cold Advisory
is handling the situation. Will leave inherited headline in place
mainly on the grounds that some locations within the advisory area
are seeing dewpoints that, if reached, would bring these sites
within criteria.

Model solutions remain largely unchanged, providing difficulty in
creating original discussion content. The upper level ridge will
begin its slow breakdown today as the ridge axis finally reaches W
WA. Weak trough slides in Tuesday with only increasing clouds to
come with it. Ridging rebuilds into the area for Wednesday.

The aforementioned clouds will help to take the edge off of these
cold overnight temperatures and providing at least a couple degrees
of warming, ranging from the mid 20s to near 30 both tonight and
Tuesday night. Daytime highs may see a degree or two of warming
between today and Tuesday, but not enough to impact the forecast
temperature range of the lower to mid 40s...with Wednesday being
nearly identical to its predecessor.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Discrepancies in the
deterministic models persist when considering Thursday, again all
rooted in the amplitude of the second ridge mentioned in the short
term. ECMWF maintains a lower amplitude, making W WA susceptible to
a weak trough quickly passing through late Thursday and early
Friday. The GFS offers a higher amplitude ridge, keeps the timing
similar to the ECMWF with a trough coming in late Thursday, but
deepens this feature to the point where precip would persist for
much of the day Friday before the system exits Friday night. As has
been the case, the NBM has latched on to this uncertainty and is
trying to play PoPs down the middle...making a case for some precip
while still keeping things out of the likely or categorical range
that the GFS solution would suggest. Taken within the scope of the
ensembles, however, this solution, PoPs of around 40 pct, ends up
being an outlier on the high side of things as the statistical mean
remains more in the 10-20 pct range. As such, while precip cannot be
ruled out, chances do seem lower than what is forecast. Ridging
returns for Saturday and Sunday, and while still over the Pacific
waters, its influence will be enough to bring a return to dry
conditions.

Daytime high temps in the extended do not seem to vary much from the
short term, ranging in the lower to mid 40s for the remainder of the
forecast period. Overnight lows Thursday night will benefit from the
incoming system and its associated clouds, bringing W WA the first
night with lows above freezing in quite some time...but not by
much...ranging in the lower to mid 30s. Falling under the influence
of another ridge will produce lows akin to the short term, falling
once again below freezing and ranging from the mid 20s to around 30
from Friday night through the end of the forecast period.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge over Western Washington this morning
weakening this afternoon and tonight. Weak trough moving through
late tonight with the ridge rebuilding Tuesday. Northerly flow aloft
becoming westerly this afternoon. Northwesterly flow aloft tonight
in to Tuesday. In the lower levels high pressure over the area with
light surface gradients.

Patchy freezing fog over the Southwest Interior this morning
otherwise clear skies. Increasing high clouds this afternoon and
tonight.

KSEA...19 degree temperature dew point spread combined with east
winds 6 to 10 knots this morning keeping skies clear at KSEA.
Increasing high clouds this afternoon and tonight. Winds coming
around to northeast 4 to 8 knots 18z-03z then back to east 4 to 8
