Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
907 AM PDT Sun Jun 22 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Weak upper level ridging will begin to build behind
the departing low, fostering warmer and drier conditions through
Tuesday. A series of weak fronts will cool things off by mid week,
with some chances for light precipitation.


&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cloudy skies will persist
through this morning, though we may start to get some
clearing/breaking up of the clouds this afternoon. Temperatures
will begin to warm back up with highs today a few degrees on
either side of 70. We will likely start Monday morning under
stratus, but should clear out in the morning before high clouds
begin to spread over the region. Highs will be a bit warmer,
climbing into the mid 70s. Tuesday still looks to be the warmest
day of the week, however, increasing clouds earlier in the day as
the ridge moves east and a shortwave trough moves through Tuesday
night may curb highs in the upper 70s and we would be short of 80
in the metro area. Some 80s are possible in the Cascade valleys
and the Southwest Interior. NBM is throwing in some light chances
for rain across the Cascades and the northwest Pacific coast
during the day on Tuesday, through this may be a bit aggressive as
the wave moves through overnight. Any precipitation that falls
Tuesday night into Wednesday morning will be very light, on the
order of a few hundredths of an inch. Most of the interior will
remain dry.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Additional upper level
troughs look to move through later Wednesday into Thursday keeping
light precipitation chances in the forecast, as well as keeping
highs cooler, in the upper 60s to low 70s. The main trough will
move through Thursday night into Friday, which will help dry
things out Friday. Warmer and drier conditions look favorable
next weekend as ridging looks to build over the area, which may
push us back into the 80s. As always with significant lead time,
these scenarios will evolve.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northerly flow aloft will continue through today with an
upper trough across the Intermountain West and ridging offshore.
Abundant low level moisture continues this morning with a mix of
VFR/MVFR/IFR cigs. Cigs are expected to slowly improve by midday
Sunday into Sunday afternoon towards BKN/OVC VFR. Increasing
onshore flow tonight into Monday morning will allow for stratus to
spread inland again towards Puget Sound for another round of
MVFR/IFR conditions. Light south winds this morning will increase
from W/SW this afternoon.

KSEA...MVFR/IFR cigs will continue through this morning. Cigs
will slowly lift by midday Sunday, becoming BKN VFR by the
afternoon (19z/20z). VFR cigs are expected into tonight, with
another round of MVFR/IFR stratus spreading inland towards SEA
early Monday morning. S/SW surface winds.

.MARINE...Surface high pressure will build offshore today and
continue into Monday. Otherwise, onshore flow will increase
periodically through the majority of the week. This will result in
Small Craft Advisory winds possible at times through the Strait of
Juan de Fuca. A Small Craft Advisory has been issued for Sunday
evening for the central Strait of Juan de Fuca with gusts of 20 to
25 kts. West winds will also be elevated for the eastern Strait of
Juan de Fuca, but expected to remain below SCA threshold at this
time. Another round of increasing onshore flow through the Strait of
Juan de Fuca may bring SCA winds Tuesday evening. Winds are expected
to remain below SCA for the majority of other area waters through at
least midweek.

Seas of 6 to 8 feet will subside to 4 to 6 feet by late today into
Monday and remain around 4 to 6 feet through midweek. JD
