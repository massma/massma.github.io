Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
401 AM PDT Tue Jul 30 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level trough exiting the area this morning with
an upper level ridge beginning to build this afternoon. Upper
level ridge continuing to build through Friday with the ridge axis
well east of the area. The ridge will weaken slightly as a weak
upper level trough forms offshore the first part of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
cloudy skies over Western Washington early this morning. Doppler
radar has shower activity over the Central Puget Sound, Northwest
Interior, Coast and over the Cascades north of Mount Rainier.
Temperatures at 3 am/10z with the cloud cover and showers are in
in the lower 60s.

Upper level trough exiting the area early this morning with an
upper level ridge beginning to build over the area this afternoon
from the southeast. Shower activity will come to an end for
the most part this morning. Deep layer of low level moisture
over the area with cloud tops around 6000 feet. Any subsidence at
all this morning will squeeze this low level moisture. Have added
areas of drizzle to the forecast for the interior lowlands this
morning. Even with the ridge building this afternoon with such a
deep marine layer expect cloudy skies until well into the
afternoon with only partly sunny skies by late afternoon. Cloud
cover most of the day will lomit the daytime heating to only up
to about 10 degrees putting highs in the mid 60s to mid 70s.

Upper level ridge continuing to build tonight and Wednesday. Light
flow in the lower levels becoming northerly Wednesday afternoon.
This will scour out the low level moisture giving the area sunny
skies. By 00z Thursday 500 mb heights up to the mid to upper 580
dms. Temperatures will warm quickly with the sunshine Wednesday
with high near normal, around 70 on the coast and 70s and lower
80s inland. Lows tonight in the mid 50s to lower 60s.

Ridge building continuing Wednesday night and Thursday. 500 mb
heights in the lower 590 dms by late Thursday afternoon. 850 mb
temperatures which are only in the plus 10 to 12C range this
morning warming to the plus 20 to 24C range by late Thursday
afternoon. This weather pattern is the one we had for many days
in July. Low level flow never does turn offshore but with the
temperatures aloft so warm highs in the 80s and lower 90s over the
interior with mid 70s to lower 80s along the coast.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement with Western Washington remaining on the backside of the
strong upper level ridge through the period. Weak trough
developing offshore could put a small dent in the ridge early
next week. If that happens all it will do is lower the highs
temperatures a few degrees. Low level flow remaining onshore
through the period which will prevent highs from getting much
above 90 in the warmer locations. In general highs in the upper
70s to near 90 for the interior and in the 70s on the coast. Lows
in the mid 50s to lower 60s. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Moist northwest flow aloft over western Washington
this morning as an upper level trough continues to pass through
the region. MVFR ceilings primarily over the area this morning
although seeing some localized spots of IFR/LIFR, especially in
the typical lower prone locations such as KHQM and KCLM. Expect
this trend to largely continue throughout the day with plentiful
low level moisture, which will keep low clouds around throughout
the evening. Showers will gradually taper off through the
morning, with spotty coverage across area terminals.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings this morning, with a 20% chance of IFR
ceilings through 16z. Southwesterly winds will generally maintain
5 to 10 knots through the remainder of the day. Low MVFR ceilings
will likely continue much of the day with showers tapering in the
afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front has exited the area waters this morning,
with high pressure offshore gradually rebuilding through
Wednesday. Diurnally northerly winds will develop over the coastal
waters through the rest of the week, but will look to remain
under any threshold.

Coastal seas generally 3 to 5 feet through Friday but will
gradually build upwards to 6 to 7 feet in the outer water zones
into the weekend. Combined with a short period, can potentially
see some steepness to seas, especially farther offshore in the
outer water zones throughout the weekend.

.CLIMATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Bellingham ended up with 0.96 inches of rain yesterday.
The normal for the entire month of July is 0.88 inches. It was the
10th wettest July day on record ( records started in 1948 ) and
the wettest July day since 1.12 inches on July 20, 1993.

Seattle-Tacoma airport picked up 0.01 inches with a shower after 3
am. Yesterday Seattle-Tacoma airport had 0.13 inches of rain.
Including the Federal Building records which go back to 1894 this
is only the 2nd time Seattle has had measurable rain on both July
29th and July 30th. The only other time was in 1955 where there
was measurable rain on the last 8 days of July in Seattle ( La
Nina summer in the middle of a two and a half year La Nina ).

Again using the combined Seattle-Tacoma airport and Federal
Building records this mornings measurable rain is the 10th time
since 1894 there has been measurable rain on this day in Seattle.
The date with the least days of measurable rain is now August 4th
with 9 days.

With all the talk of rain it was lost in the shuffle that 15 years
ago on the 29th Seattle had at the time the warmest day on record
with a high of 103. The heat dome of June 2021 broke this record.
