Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
801 PM PDT Sun Aug 18 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong upper level low will continue to spin
offshore tonight into Monday before moving inland Monday night. This
will keep rain in the forecast into Tuesday night. Isolated
thunderstorms cannot be ruled out. Unsettled weather will continue
into midweek, with more chances of showers and thunderstorms in the
second half of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Activity winding down over
much of W WA this evening, although some echoes still popping up
over the North Cascades. Radar estimated rainfall rates still
showing some patches of heavy rain, however with the speed these
cells are moving to the northeast, this should be pretty brief and
likely will not significantly impact burn scars in that area. While
one would not rule out a stray lightning strike associated with
these cells, the current trend in activity is down and would expect
that things are coming to an end. Remainder of the area mainly
partly cloudy thanks to debris cloudiness, however mostly cloudy
conditions do linger over and near the coast thanks to the proximity
of the upper low.

Inherited forecast remains on track and see no reason for evening
updates. Fore forecast details, please refer to the Previous
Discussion section below.

From Previous Discussion...Recent radar imagery shows a few
convective showers moving through Grays Harbor county into Mason
County, moving northward. There are also some thunderstorms
developing in southern Lewis County also moving northeastward. This
will largely be in the trend through the remainder of the afternoon,
with showers and possible thunderstorms developing south of our area
(Lewis, Grays Harbor county) moving north, towards the Olympic
Peninsula and areas adjacent. In any thunderstorm that does develop,
the primary impacts are gusty erratic winds, frequent lightning, and
heavy rain. Again, coverage from these storms will be less than what
we saw yesterday, mostly confined to the western portion of our CWA,
but cannot rule out a stray storms drifting into Puget Sound this
evening.

This activity will likely last through the early evening hours.
As we progress into the nighttime hours, mostly all activity will
diminish as diurnal heating gets shut off and instability values
plummet.

The upper level low offshore will continue to move northeast
offshore into Tuesday. As of now, dry conditions will start of
Monday with perhaps areas of clouds and fog, with temperatures in
the mid 70s. Chance of rain showers will uptick across the area
Monday night into Tuesday, most likely having to do with wrap
around moisture from the aforementioned upper level low.

Another upper level low will drop down from British Columbia on
Wednesday night, which could provide another round of showers and
scattered thunderstorms across the area. he track of this upper
low is still uncertain, along with the placement. But for now, the
highest probabilities of thunderstorms seem to be located in the
Olympics and the Cascades, with the potential (20-25%) for the
interior lowlands.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...From Previous
Discussion...Ensembles continue to highlight unsettled weather
throughout the long term period. The aforementioned upper level low
will continue to track southward through Friday, with a chance of
showers/thunderstorms, primarily Thursday and Friday. The ensembles
are starting to show signals of possibly a ridge building into
Sunday, which could bring back the warm and dry conditions to our
region.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Convection and thunderstorms have wind down and
here this evening. Pockets of low clouds and IFR to LIFR conditions
possible overnight. Otherwise mainly dry on Monday except for
showers developing along the coast in the afternoon. 33

KSEA...Previous showers and nearby thunderstorms have pushed off and
away from the terminal this evening. VFR conditions are expected
most of the upcoming TAF period but there`s a 20-25% chance of
IFR/MVFR conditions are possible between 12-16z Monday highlighted
by the NBM. Winds S to 10 kt turning SW Monday afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure will remain offshore through Monday with
S/SE flow over the waters. The strongest winds are over the Coastal
Waters and a Small Craft Advisory is in effect. The low will weaken
offshore on Tuesday. A Pacific system will track down the coast
Wednesday night and Thursday. Onshore flow will prevail into the
weekend with high pressure offshore. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>From Previous Discussion...An upper level low will
continue to remain in the region into Monday. A disturbance has
already triggered scattered thunderstorms this afternoon from the
Southwest Interior into the Olympics. There is also a chance of
thunderstorms in the North Cascades later this evening. Rainfall
amounts will be significantly lower across the area, with the best
chance of wetting rain in the Olympics. With continued cool, cloudy,
and high humidity conditions well into the week, holdover fires may
only smolder for quite sometime until we get our next hot, dry, or
windy conditions.
