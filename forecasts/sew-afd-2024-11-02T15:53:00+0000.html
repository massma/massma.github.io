Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
853 AM PDT Sat Nov 2 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Unsettled weather conditions will linger over the
weekend with showers continuing, especially in the Cascades. A
stronger frontal system will arrive on Monday for more rain,
widespread breezy to locally windy conditions, mountain snow and
high surf conditions. Drier weather is possible by midweek.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Latest radar imagery showing
scattered showers, mainly focused on the Olympic Peninsula and the
Cascades of Skagit and Snohomish counties. Also displaying a
Convergence Zone over the northern half of King county stretching
all the way to the Cascades...which may be producing some additional
snowfall for Stevens Pass.

Messaging from both deterministic models and ensembles remains
consistent as moisture along the back-end of an exiting trough will
keep precip in the forecast today into Sunday morning. Agreement
also remains intact with regard to precip amounts...with those of
the next 24 hours being lower than those of the previous 24 hours.
Still, within that time frame, NBM is still advertising snowfall
amounts that on their high end would meet headline criteria in the
central and southern Cascades. As such, inherited Winter Weather
Advisory there will remain in place. For the remainder of Sunday,
while deterministic models suggest there may be a brief dry period,
ensembles are not so quick to come to that conclusion, allowing
precip...although in pretty low amounts...to persist. Inherited
slight chance to chance PoPs during this time frame covers this well.

A stronger Pacific system makes its may to WA on Monday with
another round of rain and windy weather (mainly coast and north
interior), and heavy mountain snow (central and north Cascades).
Snow levels initially start low around 3500` but increase through
the day to around 4000-4500`. A strong onshore push develops
Monday night with the focus for wind impacts switching to the
strait and Admiralty Inlet area.

Temps in the near term remain pretty static, daytime highs in the
lower to mid 50s and overnight lows in the lower to mid 40s.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...From Previous
Discussion...High pressure brings a quieter period of weather from
Tuesday through the end of the week as moisture is deflected north
into B.C. Temperatures will be cooler, though, with lows dipping
into the 30s Wednesday and Thursday mornings. The ridge shows signs
of weakening/flattening toward the weekend with rain returning to
western WA. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>NW flow aloft as a trough moves through the area. A
mixed bag of ceilings continues with ceilings MVFR to IFR with
scattered showers continuing, VFR conditions away from those
showers. More widespread MVFR conditions should develop this morning
before slowly lifting back up to VFR early this afternoon. Another
period of MVFR conditions will develop this afternoon into this
evening as a cold front passes across the area with another round of
rain showers moving through the area this evening. Winds remain
southwesterly through the TAF period 5 to 10 kt.

KSEA...MVFR conditions in scattered showers with occasional breaks
to VFR this morning. Ceilings will slowly rise back to VFR around 19-
21Z before falling back to MVFR this evening with another round of
rain. Winds remain southwesterly 5 to 10 kt through the TAF period.

.MARINE...A surface trough continues to move inland through
Washington this morning. Saturday will allow for a period of
relatively benign conditions with the lull between systems. A cold
front will move through the waters tonight into Sunday.
Northwesterly winds behind the cold front look to increase to Small
Craft Advisory strength across the outer coastal zones. A push of
westerlies down the Strait of Juan de Fuca may create periods of
Small Craft Advisory strength winds through early Sunday morning, in
particular through the East Entrance and Admiralty Inlet. Winds will
ease during the day on Sunday before another system approaches the
area on Monday. Widespread gusty winds, potentially reaching gale
force, are possible ahead of the front. Strong westerly winds will
continue behind the front Monday afternoon into Monday evening,
where gale force winds are likely through the Strait of Juan de
Fuca. A few gusts approaching storm force cannot be ruled out during
this period through the Central and East Strait.

High pressure will build across the area Tuesday through mid-week,
allowing winds to ease on Tuesday and remain benign through the week.

Seas across the coastal waters remain around 7 to 9 ft and remain
like so through tonight. Seas will begin to rise above 10 ft
tonight. Long period swell being generated by a low pressure system
in the Gulf of Alaska is on track to arrive Sunday morning, bringing
waves 14 to 18 ft with a dominant period of around 19 seconds. This
may bring high surf conditions to the Pacific Coast. Seas will
rapidly rise Monday morning as the next low pressure system moves
through the area waters, with seas up to 18 to 22 feet possible
(with the highest seas being in the outer water zones). This will be
another period to monitor for high surf conditions. Seas will slowly
subside Monday night into Tuesday, below 10 ft by Tuesday night and
remain around 5 to 8 ft through mid-week.
