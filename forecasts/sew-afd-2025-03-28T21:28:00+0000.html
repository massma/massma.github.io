Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
228 PM PDT Fri Mar 28 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A broad trough of low pressure will continue to
produce cool and showery conditions through Saturday. A weak
ridge of high pressure will provide drier and mild conditions on
Sunday before another trough arrives early in the coming week with
additional chances for showers and a return to cooler conditions.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showers continue to persist
across western Washington in association with a low pressure system
just west of the northern tip of Vancouver Island. This low pressure
system will continue to get pulled northward tonight and tomorrow,
allowing shower activity to slowly taper off throughout the day on
Saturday. Additionally, breezy winds this afternoon will begin to
ease late tonight into tomorrow morning. The strongest winds are
occuring this afternoon, but gusts up to 25 to 35 mph will remain
possible through the northern interior, particularly around Whidbey
Island and the Admiralty Inlet area. A transient shortwave ridge
will build over the area Saturday night into Sunday, allowing the
low-level clouds to clear out, with high cirrus moving in ahead of
the next system. This will allow for the temperature range to
increase, with lows Sunday morning in the upper 30s to near 40, and
the high temperatures getting into the low 60s. Overall, expect
Sunday to be a rather pleasant day.

An upper level low will begin to move into the area Sunday night
into Monday, allowing for showers to return into the forecast. This
system will be fairly slow moving as the upper level low gradually
guides it southeastward. Showers will persist through Monday. Snow
levels look to lower to around 2000-2500 ft Monday, allowing for a
few inches of snowfall accumulation at the passes. Probabilities
are low (<20%) for seeing 6 inches or more at the passes.
Temperatures will cool back to where they were before, with highs
in the low 50s and lows in the low 40s on Monday.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The upper level low will
continue to drift southeast towards Oregon, with showers continuing
across the region. Model solutions really begin to diverge
significantly Wednesday and onward. The general mean solution, which
is reflected in the operational global models, has broad troughing
over the western USA with perhaps a shortwave trough digging south
out of the Gulf of Alaska. Looking at ensemble cluster analysis, the
potential outcomes range from ridging building just offshore over
the Pacific and keeping the wave well into Canada to a deep trough
digging into the northwestern USA.

Behind this trough would be a stronger ridge which would move in
sometime around late next week which would indicate a drier and
warmer period coming up. A lot of solutions have this ridge, in
particular a large portion of the Euro and Canadian members, but the
timing depends on the evolution of what happens before. Clusters
that keep the trough well north have the ridge pushing through as
early as Friday into early next weekend, others delay its arrival
until the following week.

The mean solution is the current forecast, with mostly chance to
likely PoPs and temperatures around to just below normal each
day through the period. 62<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft will become more light westerly
Saturday morning with a brief period of more split flow across the
Pacific Northwest. Showers continue this afternoon across Western
Washington. Showers will continue into Saturday morning before
dissipating Saturday afternoon. Generally VFR/MVFR cigs this
afternoon. VFR/MVFR will continue into Saturday, with more
continuous MVFR cigs tonight into Saturday morning along the coast,
and KPWT southwards. Cigs will improve to VFR with more SCT/BKN by
Saturday evening. Breezy S/SW surface winds through tonight,
especially PAE and northwards.

KSEA...Primarily VFR cigs into this evening, with brief periods of
MVFR at times. There remains a 35-45% chance of MVFR cigs Saturday
morning, particularly between 12-19z. Cigs will improve further to
VFR Saturday afternoon. Showers into this evening will dissipate for
a brief period tonight before increasing again early Saturday
morning. S/SW surface winds of 6 to 12 kts, with gusts up to 20 kts
possible through this evening. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface low will continue to track into British Columbia
through tonight, leading to continued elevated southerly winds
through early Saturday. Small Craft Advisory winds will continue at
times tonight for portions of the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca,
Admiralty Inlet, and the Coastal Waters. Winds will slowly subside
elsewhere, although a few brief SCA wind gusts will be possible into
early Saturday morning for the northern inland waters. Winds will
then ease further Saturday afternoon and transition more east to
northeast Sunday morning. Another weather system will bring
increased southerly winds Sunday night into Monday. An onshore flow
pattern is expected then the middle of next week.

Seas of 9 to 12 feet will continue through tonight for the Coastal
Waters before subsiding below 10 feet early Saturday afternoon. Seas
of 4 to 6 feet expected on Sunday before seas build to near 7 to 9
feet into Tuesday. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showery precipitation will continue through Saturday.
With lower snow levels in the 2500 to 3500 ft range, most area
rivers will see small rises. The exception being the Skokomish
River, which continues to rise and is expected to reach flood
stage this evening. The river will crest early tomorrow morning
before slowly receding Sunday with a break in the rainfall. With
additional chances of rain in the forecast, the river will remain
in at least Action stage through next week. Uncertainty remains in
the QPF next week, but with the river running high, additional
flooding cannot be ruled out on the Skokomish. 62<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
