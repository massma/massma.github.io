Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
244 AM PDT Tue May 20 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cooler and unsettled conditions will persist across
western Washington through the week as a series of troughs pass
over the region. Conditions are on track to warm up and dry out
over the weekend as ridging develops over the western US.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A low pressure system
stalled over British Columbia will continue to send a series of
waves across western Washington through Wednesday, maintaining
cooler temperatures with continued shower activity and a chance
for isolated afternoon thunderstorms. Temperatures will peak in
the mid to upper 50s along the coast and in the low 60s further
inland under cloudy skies. Onshore flow will also promote the
potential for areas of fog and low stratus each morning,
especially across the lowlands near the Puget Sound. Convergence
zone showers are expected to linger Wednesday morning along the
King/Snohomish County line before tapering off late Wednesday
morning as the upper low dissipates.

A trough axis will shift inland throughout the day Wednesday, with
the bulk of the moisture associated with this system moving to our
south. Shower activity will mostly be confined to the south of
the Puget Sound through the afternoon and evening Wednesday, with
a slight chance of additional showers over the mountains.

Weak ridging is favored to pass over the region on Thursday,
allowing conditions to warm up and dry out. High temperatures will
return to near normal for mid May with plenty of sun breaks.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Forecast confidence decreases
heading into the weekend, with some uncertainty over precipitation
on Friday. The placement of an approaching cutoff low will
determine whether western Washington stays dry or sees some
showers, but ensembles continue to favor a drier and warmer
solution. An upper level ridge will amplify over the western US by
Saturday, with southwest flow bringing some warming to western
Washington. By Sunday, most of the interior lowlands will likely
see high temperatures well into the 70s with mostly clear skies.

Deterministic forecast models hint at a front crossing western
Washington on Monday, bringing in cooler conditions. However,
models remain fairly consistent over splitting the front as it
moves inland, keeping western Washington on the drier side. Any
incoming showers that materialize would be light in nature, only
dropping a few hundredths of an inch. Both operational and
ensemble forecasts also suggest that ridging could dominate the
forecast into early next week, but models continue to show a wide
spread in solutions.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level troughing to the north will continue to
promote zonal flow aloft through the TAF period. Scattered shower
activity continues for areas along the Olympic Peninsula and for
areas generally north of KPAE early this morning, with many of the
central Sound terminals currently remaining rain shadowed.

Conditions have been a mixed bag of VFR to MVFR at the terminals
overnight. Expect cigs to gradually lower area-wide later this
morning, with most sites expected to drop between MVFR to low-end
VFR. Gradual improvement towards VFR is expected again by the
afternoon, however shower activity will continue throughout the
day and could bring localized pockets of reduced cigs and vis at
times. Isolated thunderstorms will also be possible across the
region today, but confidence remains too low to include in any
single TAF issuance at this time. Increasing onshore flow tonight
will likely aid in the development of a convergence zone over
Snohomish/King counties between 03-06Z. Southerly surface winds
will generally persist for interior terminals between 7-12 kt
today and could become breezy this afternoon with gusts to 18-20
kt possible. Westerly surface winds expected for coastal terminals
between 10-15 kt.

KSEA...MVFR cigs this morning, though expect gradual improvement
to VFR again by this afternoon. Scattered shower activity through
the day could briefly bring a reduction to cigs and vis to the
terminal at times. Convergence zone development looks to remain
north of the terminal tonight. S/SW winds at 7-12 kt, with gusts
to 20 kt possible this afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow will continue across the region, with a
weak westerly push expected through the Strait of Juan de Fuca
tonight. While sustained winds look to generally remain between
15-20 kt, probabilistic guidance highlights a 60-80 percent chance
of wind gusts reaching small craft criteria across portions of
the central and eastern Strait for a brief period tonight. Thus,
have gone ahead and issued a small craft advisory for these areas.
Small craft advisories also remain in effect for the coastal
waters and the Western Strait for seas between 10-13 ft today.
Seas are expected to gradually subside towards 8-10 ft again
tonight into Wednesday.

Weak high pressure will build back into the area waters Wednesday
and Thursday, bringing northwesterly winds to the coastal waters.
Seas will continue to subside towards 4-6 ft into Thursday. A
weakening system may approach the waters on Friday, before high
pressure builds into the coastal waters again over the weekend.
Another system may approach the area waters again late in the
weekend into early next week.
