Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
205 AM PDT Tue Apr 1 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A broad trough will remain over the area into midweek
for a chance of showers and near seasonal temperatures. High
pressure aloft will build into the region toward the end of the
week for dry conditions and temperatures trending well above
normal by the weekend. A weak front will approach the region early
next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A vertically stacked
trough will move onshore over Oregon later this morning. A broad
upper level trough will continue to influence Western Washington
into Wednesday as little disturbances embedded in the trough kick
off a few showers from time to time. In addition, low level
onshore flow will lead to some convergence over Puget Sound
extending into the Cascades through tonight. Guidance suggests 1
to 4 inches of snow will fall in the Cascade passes by late this
evening.

The next weak disturbance will dip southward from British Columbia
on Wednesday keeping showers in the forecast for a broader portion
of the area and temperatures on the cool side. Then changes begin
to take place Wednesday night as drier northerly flow aloft
develops and the upper trough axis shifts east of the Cascades.
Upper ridging will start to build into the region on Thursday with
northerly flow at the surface developing at the surface by
Thursday afternoon. This should help scour out any remaining low
level moisture for some sunshine for the lowlands by mid-
afternoon. High temperatures will nudge upward slightly to near or
a little above normal.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...The upper level ridge
continues to build into Western Washington on Friday with 500
millibar heights rising above 570 dam and the low level flow
turning weakly offshore. With plenty of sunshine, this will boost
much of the lowlands (including coastal areas) into the 60s.
The ridge axis moves onshore on Saturday for further warming into
the mid 60s to lower 70s for the lowlands. Some uncertainty
creeps into the forecast Sunday into Monday as ensembles disagree
on how quickly the ridge will weaken and flatten as it shifts
eastward. In general, the GFS ensembles are 12 to 24 hours faster
than the Euro ensembles with breaking the ridge down. The current
forecast is a compromise of the two with some increase in cloud
cover by late Sunday and a low end chance of rain. It`s worth
mentioning that ensembles generally agree on keeping a mean ridge
position over the interior West heading into early next week...so
it wouldn`t be surprising to see the front currently projected
for Sunday night and Monday lose some gusto in subsequent model
runs. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light southerly to southeasterly flow is ongoing across
all terminals early this morning with MVFR to VFR cigs. A decaying
convergence zone is keeping showers in the Cascade foothills with
additional showers along the coast. This will taper soff through
the morning hours. Terminals that are MVFR can likely expect
breakout to VFR cigs after 20Z. Some westward extension of the low
cigs is possible (to the BFI/SEA area) between 17Z and 19Z before
breaking out. Expect increasing onshore flow in the afternoon
with renewed convergence zone activity across the central Sound in
the evening.

KSEA...MVFR cigs and southwesterly flow at 4 to 6 kts presently at
the terminal. Some weak shower activity is possible over the next
few hours as the remnant convergence zone drifts south. In its wake,
a period from around 17Z to 19Z may feature lower ceilings to around
2000 ft before breaking out into more firmly VFR skies. Expect south
to southwesterly flow through the period with a renewed chance of
convergence zone showers after 06Z tonight.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow will increase today in the wake of a passing
surface low to the south. Small craft westerlies through the Strait
of Juan de Fuca are possible tonight, with the winds focused moreso
in the Central and Eastern Strait. Additionally, the outer coastal
waters, namely the northern zones, may see small craft winds as
well tonight.

Surface high pressure will then build midweek and into the
weekend for more benign conditions.

Coastal seas are hovering between 7 and 9 feet early this morning,
and are expected to decrease to around 6 feet by this afternoon. A
more notable decrease in sea state to around 4 feet will occur by
Thursday as high pressure begins to return to the region.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The Skokomish River will remain in action stage into
midweek, but overall QPF through the week ahead does not look
sufficient to produce any flood concerns there or along any other
rivers across the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SEW WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>WA...Coastal Flood Advisory until 6 AM PDT early this morning for
     Grays Harbor County Coast-Northern Washington Coast.

PZ...None.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
