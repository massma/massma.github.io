Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
821 PM PDT Fri Sep 13 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Cool and cloudy conditions will persist through the
forecast period as a series of troughs move over the Pacific
Northwest. Rain showers will spread inland later today with a
threat of lightning mainly over the North Cascades. Showers will
continue through the weekend with brief drying on Monday. Another
system will move over the region mid-week, ushering in another
round of rainfall as cloudy skies and cooler temperatures
continue.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The current forecast
remains on track with no planned updates. 33

Previous discussion...A majority of low stratus surrounding the
Puget Sound has burned off this afternoon, but sun breaks in the
clouds will be short lived this afternoon as a storm system moves
into western Washington. A band of rainfall will continue to
progress inland this afternoon, overspreading the region by the
late evening. Conditions will continue to destabilize behind the
initial band of rainfall, with showers continuing throughout the
day Saturday. Model guidance continues to favor shower development
over the North Cascades on Saturday, as well as maintaining a 20%
to 30% chance of a few lightning strikes. A surface front will
slide across western Washington later in the day on Saturday,
shutting down most of the precipitation, with the exception of
Puget Sound convergence zone activity that will continue into
Saturday night. Rainfall totals will generally range between a
tenth and half an inch across the lowlands, with higher amounts up
to an inch over the mountains.

The upper level trough will shift southward on Sunday, with light
isolated showers continuing mainly south of the Puget Sound.
Cloudy skies and below-normal temperatures will continue with weak
high pressure slowly amplifying inland from the west.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Ensembles continue to show
good agreement over split flow developing to start off next week,
allowing conditions to briefly dry out. Another storm system will
move into the Pacific Northwest from British Columbia on Tuesday,
bringing in another round of rainfall across western Washington
mid-week. Deterministic models are suggesting ridging developing
later next week, though ensembles hint at the potential for a
shortwave passage that may keep a chance of showers for the area.
Temperatures will stay below normal through the period, peaking in
the 60s across the lowlands.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly to west-southwesterly flow aloft tonight into
Saturday with the advance of an upper level trough. Main front ahead
of this system passing through W WA now with leading edge running
along the Cascades at the time of this writing /750 PM PDT/. Surface
winds generally light and variable.

In spite of FROPA, majority of W WA seeing VFR conditions, although
some spots of MVFR conditions present. With abundant low level
moisture in place, cigs will sink tonight down into MVFR category
although locations that tend to favor lower cigs may see IFR
conditions. Overnight shower activity will also play a role in cigs
and any terminals that see these showers could also dip down into
IFR. Even with the shower threat lingering into Saturday, cigs
expected to rebound area-wide to VFR by noon and stay that way for
the remainder of the TAF period.

KSEA...VFR conditions in place this evening but will erode down into
MVFR after 06Z. Main front has moved past the terminal, however
overnight showers are expected. Any shower passing over the terminal
may reduce cigs further down into IFR. VFR conditions expected to
return by 20Z Saturday, but no real clearing is expected. Winds
light and variable turning more southerly tonight with speeds
generally at or below 5 kts. Speeds will increase to 5-10 kts after
12Z.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the Pacific waters and low pressure
inland will maintain onshore flow. The post-frontal environment will
allow showers at times over the area waters overnight and into
Saturday. Westerlies down the Strait Saturday may approach SCA
criteria, but at this time data continues to paint a very borderline
scenario, so will leave decision on headlines for next shift. This
push may allow for convergence zone development Saturday afternoon,
potentially fostering additional shower development. Otherwise,
light northwest winds will continue Sunday into the work week next
week, with the next best chance of precipitation on Wednesday.

Seas of 3 to 5 feet will build to 5 to 7 feet Sunday, dropping to 3
to 5 feet Monday before returning to 5 to 8 feet Wednesday and
Thursday.
