Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
614 AM EST Wed Nov 22 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
Low pressure tracks over the area this morning and passes to the
northeast in the afternoon. High pressure then builds in during
Thanksgiving Day and remains in control through at least the first
half of the weekend. A low pressure system may impact the area
Sunday into Monday.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface low pressure continues to deepen just to our south as an
associated mid-level shortwave approaches. This low will pass
directly over us this morning. Winds have already lowered
significantly over western portions of the area as the pressure
gradient decreases with the low approaching. However, farther
east with a low level jet and tight pressure gradient wind
gusts along the coast could reach 40 mph, with far eastern
Suffolk County likely seeing gusts 45-50 mph. A Wind Advisory
remains in effect for southeast and northeast Suffolk County.
Rain continues to be light to moderate widespread over the
eastern two thirds of the area. See Hydrology section below.

Clouds stick around today with cyclonic flow aloft. Low pressure
slowly departs to the north and east. Highs will be in the mid 50s
to low 60s.

Another low forms off the coast tonight with a more potent mid-level
shortwave passing well to our south. The deepening of this low
increases the pressure gradient over our area and wind winds start
to increase again. Skies start to clear as dry air works into the
area, but with winds increasing it does not look like a good
radiational cooling night. Lows will be in the upper 30s to mid
40s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/...
Heights rise aloft early Thursday before the pattern becomes zonal
through Thursday night. Aforementioned low pressure offshore
exits to the east as high pressure slowly builds in from the
west. The pressure gradient will be slowly decreasing through
the day and in turn the winds will be slowly decreasing. Expect
a northwest wind in the early morning around 10 to 15 mph with
gusts up to 20 to 25 mph to lower to 5 to 10 mph with gusts up
to 15 mph by the late afternoon. With lowering winds and clear
skies, Thursday night looks much better for radiational cooling.
Lows will be in the low 30s to low 40s.

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
High pressure then continues to remain in control through
Saturday with only a weak and dry cold front passing through at
some point late day/early evening Friday. Highs slightly below
normal on Friday, then even colder on Saturday with highs only
near 40 in most spots.

Weak low pressure off the Southeast coast heads north on Sunday,
passing just SE of the 40N/70W benchmark Monday morning. An inverted
trough extending north from the center of the low will bring some
moisture and lift to the forecast area with a chance of rain mainly
Sunday afternoon and night. Looking at GFS and ECMWF, thermal
profiles would support rain, however well north and west could see a
rain/snow mix until at some point perhaps during Sunday night when
thermal profiles warm up.

Likely dry for Monday and Tuesday as the storm heads farther away
east and weak high pressure fills in behind it through Tuesday.

&&

.AVIATION /11Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
Low pressure was moving off the southern New Jersey coast at 10Z
and will be moving over the region through 12Z, and then to the
east through this morning, moving east of the area early this
afternoon. High pressure then slowly builds in from the
southwest tonight.

Ceilings have lowered to IFR with light to moderate rain.
Briefly heavy rain is possible west until 10Z and east until
around 13Z. With a little faster movement of the low rain will
be tapering off across the western terminals 09Z to 10Z, 11Z to
13Z across southwestern Connecticut, and central Long Island,
and 13Z to 15Z east. Ceilings slowly improve during the morning,
but may not improve to VFR until this evening.

ESE winds 10-20 kt with G25-35kt early this morning, with the
highest winds and gusts at coastal terminals. A few gusts could
come close to 40 kt at KGON. LLWS is also likely until 10-12z
as winds reach 45-50 kt at 2kft.

As the low pressure moves across the area in the morning, winds will
diminish and may briefly become light and variable. Winds then
become WNW-NW in the afternoon around 10 kt or less, continuing into
the evening. WNW-NW winds should then increase late tonight with
gusts 15-20 kt possible at NYC terminals.

 ...NY Metro(KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Winds have been diminishing with the gusts ending 10Z to 11Z.
Winds may become light and variable for a time 10Z to 12Z, and
shift to the WNW to NW.

Timing of wind shift to the WNW-NW late this morning/early this
afternoon may be off by 1-2 hours.

OUTLOOK FOR 06Z THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...

Wed Night: VFR. NW wind gusts 15-20 kt possible late.

Thu: VFR with NW winds 10-15 kt with gusts around 20 kt. Locally
higher gusts possible.

Fri-Sat: VFR.

Sun: Mainly VFR. Chance of MVFR in showers late.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The Gale Warning has been cancelled on the western waters and
been replaced with a Small Craft Advisory everywhere except the
New York Harbor where winds have quickly lowered. The Gale
Warning remains in effect on the western waters through mid-
morning. A Small Craft Advisory will be needed on the ocean
waters through Thursday with lingering waves. Currently, in the
waters under a Gale Warning, winds gusts could reach 40 kts. On
the ocean waters, wave heights peak at 12-13 ft.

Sub-advisory conditions expected Thursday night through Sunday
with the exception of a period of 25kt+ gusts on the ocean
Friday night behind a cold front passage.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A widespread light to moderate rain will tapper off from west to
east this morning. by the afternoon, the area should be dry. An
additional 0.5 to 1 inch is forecast. Ponding, as well as some
minor urban and poor drainage flooding, is possible. Flash
flooding is not expected.

There are no hydrologic concerns Wednesday afternoon through early
next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
With the high tide cycle having passed across the southern areas
of New York City, and Southern Nassau county, and into Hudson,
Essex, and Union counties of New Jersey, the coastal flooding
advisories and coastal flood statement were cancelled. And with
a brief touch at the minor coastal flooding benchmarks along
the shores of Middlesex and New London Counties, the coastal
flood statement will end at 12Z.

Otherwise, no other changes were made to the remaining coastal
flood advisories for this morning.

Surge will be peaking across Long Island Sound through 12Z as
southeast to east winds continue as low pressure tracks to the
south of New York City. Only minor adjustments were made to the
total water levels across the shores of Long Island Sound.

Surge forecasts remain mostly in the 2 to 2.5 ft range with
some locally higher surges up to 3 ft. Parts of Western LI
Sound Shorelines have the higher end of the surge, more in the
2.5 to 3 ft range.

This morning`s high tide cycle will be the main tide cycle of
concern with regards to coastal flooding as winds become more
westerly for the next high tide cycle. However, while this will
preclude most additional minor coastal flooding, some residual
minor coastal flooding will still be possible along the south
shore backs bays of Nassau and Suffolk during the time of high
tide Wednesday aft/eve. This would most likely be localized in
nature and due to water levels having some difficulty draining
due to a SE swell.
