Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
919 AM PDT Tue Oct 15 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Cooler and unsettled conditions will persist through
the week as a series of weather systems pass over the region.
Light showers will continue today before a stronger cold front
Wednesday brings in heavier rain showers, a chance of
thunderstorms, and snow over higher elevations. An atmospheric
river pattern may develop by the weekend, with potential for heavy
rainfall across western Washington.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The forecast remains on
track. No updates needed at this time.

Previous Discussion...A deep upper level trough will continue to
dig into the Pacific Northwest throughout the short- term forecast
period, bringing in a fall- like pattern of cooler temperatures,
cloudy skies, and periods of precipitation. Light shower and virga
activity will continue to slowly pivot eastward this morning
under southwest flow aloft. Another weak front will push inland
this afternoon, bringing more light rain showers across the region
this afternoon and evening. Rainfall totals will measure a few
hundredths across the lowlands throughout the day today, while
higher elevations of the Cascades will see totals between a tenth
and quarter of an inch of rainfall. Cloudy skies will limit high
temperatures today, with most areas outside of the Chehalis Valley
peaking below 60 degrees.

As the upper level trough shifts eastward towards British Columbia
on Wednesday, a stronger cold front will push across western
Washington, maintaining unsettled conditions and continuing a
cooling trend. Rainfall will spread inland early Wednesday
morning, with a colder air mass behind the front pushing inland
and causing conditions to destabilize by Wednesday afternoon.
Ensembles highlight the highest potential for thunderstorm
activity (10% to 20% chance) along the Pacific Coast Wednesday
afternoon, with potential for convective banding that may generate
locally heavy rainfall. A strong upper level jet may also allow
for breezy winds as the front crosses the region, with forecast
models continuing to highlight the development of Puget Sound
convergence zone showers Wednesday evening. Temperatures Wednesday
will drop below normal with highs in the mid to upper 50s across
the lowlands.

Energy from the upper level low will surge southward on Thursday,
swinging another front across the region. Shower activity will
continue throughout the day as temperatures continue to drop.
Highs across the lowlands will peak in the mid 50s with snow
levels dropping as low as 3500-4000 ft. While rainfall totals
between Wednesday and Thursday remain somewhat uncertain due to
convective banding, preliminary totals show amounts between 0.5"
to 0.75" for much of the lowlands, with up to an inch or more
along the coast and Cascade foothills. The mountain passes will
see a transition from rain to snow by early Thursday morning,
though temperatures above freezing will limit any accumulation
on the roads. Higher elevations of the Olympics and Cascades are
on track to see several inches of snow accumulation through
Thursday afternoon before precipitation tapers off.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Weak high pressure is favored
to develop on Friday morning as the upper level low exits to the
east, though this will likely only provide brief relief from wet
conditions. Forecast models continue to show good agreement over
an atmospheric river pattern developing along the Pacific
Northwest and British Columbia over the weekend, with potential
for significant rainfall through early next week. While the exact
placement and intensity of this storm system remain highly
uncertain at this time, ensembles show potential for 3 to 5 inches
of rainfall over higher terrain between Friday and next Monday.
This would provide some much needed moisture to the region after a
fairly dry summer and the third driest year so far in the last 30
years.

.HYDROLOGY...As fall-like weather settles into the region, a
series of frontal systems will bring periods of rainfall to
western Washington throughout the week and into the weekend. There
is a signal of an atmospheric river pattern developing this
weekend that could bring in moderate to heavy rainfall, though
the exact timing and placement of this storm system remains
uncertain. Precipitation amounts will continue to be monitored
closely over the next few days to determine if there is a risk of
elevated river flows. At this time, area rivers are not currently
forecast to rise into action stage or reach minor flood stage.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft with upper level trough
offshore through Wednesday. Weakening front moving through the
area tonight into Wednesday morning. A mixed bag of ceilings this
morning with most terminals across the interior reporting MVFR to
VFR conditions, while terminals along the coast and southern
Sound are still reporting LIFR to IFR ceilings. Expect ceilings
to improve towards more widespread VFR during the late afternoon
to early evening hours. Ceilings then look to lower towards MVFR
again overnight as the next frontal system approaches.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings through the morning hours improving to VFR
late this afternoon into this evening. Northerly winds persisting
at 5-9 kts this morning, transitioning to southwesterly around
4-7 kts this afternoon. Another round of MVFR ceilings expected
with the frontal system moving into the terminal overnight into
early Wednesday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure over the waters today. Next
front arriving late tonight into Wednesday morning. Weak high
pressure will try and build into the waters later Wednesday.
Another system moving through Thursday with the strongest system
of the week moving into Vancouver Island over the weekend.

The frontal system late tonight into Wednesday morning and the
one on Thursday will be weakening as they move into the waters.
Just the stronger system over the weekend has the potential to
produce small craft advisory winds over the coastal waters as well
as the northern portion of the inland waters.

Seas in the 6-8 foot range through midweek, increasing towards
8-10 ft across the outer coastal waters on Thursday. Seas then
look to subside briefly on Friday, before increasing towards 8-10
ft again over the weekend.
