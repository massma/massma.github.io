Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
908 AM PST Fri Feb 7 2025

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Apparent temperatures this morning dropped into the
upper teens and lower 20s across much of the lowlands, with weak
Fraser River Outflow winds causing wind chills in the lower teens
from Bellingham northward this morning. Conditions will slowly
warm this morning, and the Cold Weather Advisory will be allowed
to expire at 10 AM. Dry conditions with mostly clear skies will
prevail into the afternoon before clouds increase from the west as
another round of showers approaches the region. No updates.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper trough offshore will
push inland over the Pacific Northwest and will be followed by a
weak system moving across the region tonight into Saturday. This
system will bring the next chance for snow showers to the area.
Cool temperatures and showery conditions will persist into
Monday. Drier conditions and even colder temperatures are expected
Tuesday and Wednesday before another system looks to approach the
region on Thursday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>For most of the area, dry
conditions are expected to persist through much of the day as the
upper level trough that has been over the region the past several
days finally pushes inland and exits the area. Shower chances will
increase again later this evening and into Saturday, however, as
an upper level shortwave drops down into region. This system will
bring the next chance of snow showers to the area, with
precipitation expected to move inland along the coast by this
evening and spread into the interior overnight into Saturday. The
temperature profile will largely influence the precipitation type
and accumulation amounts. While uncertainty remains in regards to
exact snow amounts and the locations of the heaviest
precipitation, the most likely timing for snow will again be
during the overnight into early morning hours with temperatures
expected to drop back into the upper 20s to low 30s for much of
the area. At this time, snow amounts generally look lighter than
what we`ve seen the past few days - with most locations likely
seeing less than an inch. Latest NBM probabilities indicate
roughly a 20-30 percent chance of the Puget Sound lowlands seeing
an inch of snow. An area to monitor would along Hood Canal, where
easterly winds are expected and probabilities of seeing an inch of
snow are a bit higher at roughly 40 to 60 percent. With HREF
guidance showing similar probabilities, have held off on issuing
any winter weather headlines for now. However, will want to
continue to monitor the latest trends in guidance throughout the
day.

Snow showers will become more confined to the mountains by late
Saturday morning. Snow will accumulate at the passes, but expect
amounts to generally remain below advisory criteria at 2-4 inches
at this time. Temperatures will be slightly warmer over the weekend
with highs expected to be in the upper 30s to low 40s and overnight
lows to be in the upper 20s to low 30s. Showers persisting across
the lowlands Saturday evening will likely fall as a rain or rain/snow
mix. Some lingering shower activity is expected into Sunday, bringing
the potential for some light drizzle or even flurries to the lowlands-
but nothing impactful is expected at this time.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Ensemble clusters remain in
good agreement that western Washington will remain under a troughing
pattern through much of the next week. North to northeasterly
flow aloft associated with a positively tilted trough over the
region early in the week will bring drier conditions and cooler
temperatures into the area, with highs expected to be in the 30s
and overnight lows expected to dip down into the 20s and even
teens. Tuesday and Wednesday look to be the coldest overnight,
however uncertainty increases mid to late week as the spread in
temperatures increases. A system looks to approach late in the
week, reintroducing chances for showers to the region by Thursday.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly to northwesterly flow aloft as a weak ridge
sets up over the area. Most terminals are VFR this morning with
mostly clear skies across the region - the exception being KQHM
and KPWT. These lower conditions should gradually lift later
throughout the morning where VFR will take over and remain for the
rest of the day. Increasing clouds ahead of an approaching front
later this evening into tonight, with conditions likely lowering
back down to MVFR with a chance of rain/snow showers around by
Saturday morning. Northeasterly winds this morning 8 to 12 knots
will shift southerly around 18z-20z.

KSEA...VFR conditions early this morning with mostly clear skies at
the terminal. East-northeasterly winds at 4 to 6 knots turning
southerly around 19z-20z with around 4 to 8 knots. Clouds increasing
later this evening where MVFR will return into Saturday morning.

.MARINE...A surface trough moving inland this afternoon will
bring southerly winds over the coastal waters, with winds
remaining under small craft advisory criteria. Marine conditions
look to be generally calm and benign heading into early next
week.

Coastal seas 4 to 7 feet throughout the weekend and into the first
half of next week.
