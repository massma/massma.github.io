Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
227 PM PDT Sat Apr 27 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The active weather pattern will continue into early next
week as a series of fronts pass through the region. Snow is expected
in the passes Sunday night into Monday. A trend toward temperatures
closer to normal and somewhat drier conditions is expected during
the later half of the coming week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light precip continues to
spread across the area this afternoon ahead of an occluded front
that will dissipates as it moves onshore this evening. A few showers
will linger over Western Washington overnight behind the front. An
upper trough west of Haida Gwaii will dig southward into the region
later Sunday into Monday for cool, showery conditions. The cooler
temperatures aloft will destabilize the atmosphere enough for a
slight chance of thunder as well as lower snow levels to most of the
passes by Sunday night into Monday. Relatively warm ground
temperatures may limit accumulations at Snoqualmie Pass. Nonetheless,
higher Steven Pass may accumulate somewhere in the range of 5 to
7 inches over a 12 hour period (06Z-18Z Monday). Another shortwave
arrives Monday night into Tuesday. The focus with the precip with
that system may be a little further south...perhaps mainly the
southern half of the CWA.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Deterministic model runs
have shown little to no run-to-run consistency for the long term
forecast over the past couple of days. And this meshes well with the
high degree of uncertainty expressed by the NBM during that time
period. There`s increasing confidence that we`ll see a short break
in the weather on Wednesday, but the forecast picture becomes
increasingly murky Thursday through Saturday. Despite the fact that
deterministic runs of the GFS/Euro have flipped from earlier
solutions, some of the ensemble means (the Euro in particular)
maintain some positive height anomalies late next week. Current
forecasts for late next week look awfully close to climatological
norms...and that`s probably not a bad approximation at this time.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West-southwest flow aloft through the TAF period as
upper level troughing moves across the Pacific Northwest. A mix of
IFR, MVFR, and VFR CIGs this afternoon with rain and showers pushing
across the area. Any lingering VFR ceilings should lower tonight to
mostly MVFR. S-SW surface winds for area terminals (W for KCLM)
between 8-12 kt. Gusts up to 20-25 kt are possible this evening as a
front passes.

KSEA...VFR CIGs currently with rain showers along with a 30% chance
of MVFR through the remainder of the afternoon. Rainfall may be
steadier at times this evening as a front tracks over the terminal.
A gradual trend back to MVFR through the night is expected.
Southwesterly winds through the TAF period, with gusts to 20 kt
possible through this evening. VFR should rebound into Sunday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system is currently moving into area waters. SCA
are posted for most marine zones through this evening as the
aforementioned front passes. Most should be allowed to expire
tonight but a westerly surge through the strait will keep the
advisory going for the central and east strait through early Sunday
morning. Marginal wind gusts to SCA thresholds possible Sunday
afternoon (35% chance) over the offshore waters with another round
of Small Craft Advisories likely through the Strait with another
afternoon push and possibly through the beginning of next week.

Seas 6 to 8 feet tonight and through much of the day Sunday. Seas
look to increase to 8 to 10 feet Sunday night into Monday. Seas then
remain below 10 feet Tuesday onward.
