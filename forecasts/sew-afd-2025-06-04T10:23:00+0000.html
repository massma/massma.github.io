Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
323 AM PDT Wed Jun 4 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Strong high pressure remains positioned offshore for
the next several days. Expect mostly dry and mild conditions
during this time, but a pair of weak disturbances will bring
slightly cooler temperatures and increased cloud cover Wednesday
and Friday. A more significant warm up arrives late this weekend
as the upper ridge moves over the Pacific Northwest.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure
remains solidly in place offshore over the eastern Pacific this
morning. A weak disturbance embedded in the flow will enhance
the onshore flow today and bring more widespread clouds that
persist into the day, as well as cooler temperatures some 5
degrees or so cooler than we saw yesterday afternoon across the
Puget Sound region. With some weak lift ahead of this impulse,
can`t rule out a little bit of drizzle in the cloud layer,
especially along the coast this morning. Low-level onshore flow
will ease Thursday for decreasing clouds as the ridge begins to
build closer to the local area. This will bring temperatures
well into the 60s along the coast and into the upper 70s for the
warmest portions of the interior.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Another disturbance will
flatten out the ridge on Friday, providing for another deeper
onshore push and a brief pause to the warmer temperatures.
However, ensemble guidance continues to remain in strong
agreement that the upper high pressure will begin to amplify
over the late this week through the weekend.

Temperatures will more significantly Sunday, with weak low-
level flow and the strong ridge overhead bringing temperatures
well into the 80s for much of the interior. This will bring
Moderate (Orange) HeatRisk across most of the interior. Some
areas south of Puget Sound and into the Cascade foothills have a
better than 60% chance of reaching into the lower 90s.
Confidence decreases into the first half of next week, but it`s
likely that Monday will be similarly warm (especially for areas
east of Puget Sound). However, ensemble guidance begins to
depict larger ranges of potential values as there is some
uncertainty with respect to the ridge flattening out.
Regardless, it`ll at least be one or two very warm days across
the region and it`s worth noting that area water temperatures
will remain cold.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest flow aloft will continue as an upper level
ridge remains situated offshore. An increase in low level onshore
flow will pull low MVFR or IFR stratus inland to the interior this
morning. Ceilings will gradually lift to VFR this afternoon away
from the immediate coast.

KSEA...Low MVFR stratus is on track to arrive at the terminal by
around 10Z then persist through the morning. Ceilings will gradually
lift to VFR by mid-afternoon before eventually scattering out this
evening. Surface winds S/SW 5 to 8 knots will veer light N/NE late
this evening. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure will continue to remain offshore
throughout much of this week. Weak systems passing along the
periphery of the high will lead to varying degrees of onshore flow.

Diurnally driven westerlies will likely reach small craft advisory
strength at times in the central and east Strait of Juan de Fuca
most afternoons and evenings during the second half of the week.
