Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
315 PM PST Mon Nov 25 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper-low will slowly move south and eastward. While
this will still leave a chance for showers this evening and tonight,
drier conditions will emerge by Tuesday morning. A calmer weather
pattern is expected for the remainder of the week as upper level
ridging sets up over the Pacific. The chance for precipitation,
albeit low, returns for the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Still pretty gray out the
window but there are a few very small breaks out there. Current
satellite imagery does show a minor patch of less cloudy skies over
a small portion of western King and Snohomish counties...but
otherwise, plenty of low clouds to go around for the CWA this
afternoon. Radar still shows some scattered showers in W WA...one
big blob over the western half of Skagit while activity over the
Olympic Peninsula remains splotchy.

The upper level low that has been responsible for recent active
weather stretching all the way back into last week finally decides
to pick up sticks and slowly move eastward. This will allow the
system to continue to funnel moisture into the area and as such keep
PoPs going into tonight. Model solutions /both ensemble and
deterministic/ favor the low itself tracking south of the area as it
moves further inland. While some lingering showers may be possible
overnight and into Tuesday morning, this shift in trajectory will
take most of the moisture out of the area, allowing for the forecast
to begin to dry out as upper level ridging builds into W WA Tuesday
night into Wednesday. The majority of ensemble members and the
deterministic models keep the Thanksgiving holiday dry with W WA on
the leading edge of a building upper level ridge over the
Pacific...however some ensemble members are starting to throw out
hints at some possible showers. These perturbations are showing up
in the NBM, which in turn is putting slight chance to chance PoPs
into the forecast. Seeing precip emerge from these chances at this
time appears to be more the aberration than the norm.

Daytime highs in the short term will technically be on a bit of a
cooling trend, although most locations will only see about a degree
of cooling...if that...each day. Temp ranges will remain in the mid
to upper 40s. Overnight lows tonight and Tuesday night will remain
pretty similar, ranging in the upper 30s to lower 40s, however once
the ridge starts building in, lows will cool ranging in the lower to
mid 30s.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Model solutions largely in
agreement with the upper level ridge axis shifting eastward
throughout the long term period, which should suggest a dry
forecast. However, even just looking at the 12Z and 18Z runs, the
former suggested some shortwave disturbances that could introduce
PoPs, although weak, back into the forecast while the latter is not
showing much in the way of these disturbances at all. Ensembles have
a similar problem as a handful of members advertise some light
precip during this time frame as well. However, there is little to
no agreement in the timing as to when these may occur...and as such,
little to no confidence is assigned to these PoPs at this time.

Somewhat tying in with this, both daytime highs and overnight lows
do nudge upward slightly during this time frame...highs ranging in
the mid 40s to around 50 while overnight lows range in the mid 30s
to around 40, likely banking on the fact that at least some clouds
will be present to hold a little more heat in.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak upper level low off the Oregon coast drifting
east moving inland over Southern Oregon Tuesday morning and
dissipating. Light flow aloft becoming northerly Tuesday morning.
Light flow in the lower levels through Tuesday afternoon.

Weak system dissipating over the northern portion of the area this
evening. Mostly MVFR ceilings with isolated IFR ceilings from KSEA
northward. Ceilings improving to VFR 04z-07z. South of KSEA VFR
ceilings. All areas 11z-14z ceilings lowering back down to MVFR with
areas of IFR ceilings and visibility until 20z. Ceilings slowly
improving Tuesday afternoon.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings improving to VFR 02z-04z. Ceilings lowering
back down to MVFR after 09z and to IFR ceilings with possible
reduced visibility ( 3-5sm ) 12z through most of Tuesday morning.
Slow improvement Tuesday afternoon. Variable wind 5 knots or less.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak low off the Southern Oregon coast will move
inland and dissipate tonight. High pressure building over the waters
Tuesday will remain in place into the weekend. Small craft advisory
winds or seas not expected through the period. Some long period
swell is possible over the weekend with the weather system well to
the west. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The Skokomish River has fallen below flood stage this
morning and the warning has been cancelled. The river stage will
continue to slowly fall tonight and through this week. With no
hydrologically significant QPF, no river flooding is expected in the
next seven days.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
