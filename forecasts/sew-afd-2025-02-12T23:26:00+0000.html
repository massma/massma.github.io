Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
326 PM PST Wed Feb 12 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Dry conditions and cold conditions will continue
overnight with breezy easterly winds at many locations. A frontal
system moving to the south will spread precipitation northwards
Thursday in into Friday morning resulting in a wintery mix of
precipitation especially from Snohomish County southward. More
moderate temperatures with lowland rain and mountain snow returns
Saturday and continues into early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Very cold temperatures again
overnight with most areas expected to dip down into the upper teens
to mid 20s again across Western Washington. Wind chills will drop
into the down into the low teens especially with the easterly
winds that are expected to develop along the Cascade foothills
along the I-90 corridor and in and around Enumclaw. The most
likely forecast is for easterly winds 20 to 30 mph with gusts 45
to 50 mph through Thursday morning. Have updated the wind advisory
to include the Bellevue and Vicinity zone, with some potential
for the gusty easterlies to extend west of the foothills,
especially through Issaquah and the Lake Sammamish area and the
North Coast including Neah Bay. In addition, the Cold Weather
Advisory continues for most of Western Washington, make sure to
bundle up if you`re heading outside, Thursday morning may well
have the lowest apparent temperatures of the week for many areas.

Along with the increased easterly flow at the surface,
precipitation will begin to spread northwards Thursday morning
from the south, reaching the south Puget Sound by late morning and
the metro areas as midday. Temperatures may have enough time to
moderate in the afternoon there remains enough T/Td spread that
any precipitation falling could well start as snow, or at the very
least rain/snow mix. High resolution ensembles and deterministic
guidance show the first band of precipitation moving through the
metro areas through the afternoon, potentially affecting the
afternoon commute for many areas. Behind this more organized band
of precipitation, ensembles show showers moving into Western
Washington through the night from the Southwest - with additional
potential for snow accumulation into Friday morning. There is a
60-70% chance of accumulations 1 to 2 inches from the Hood Canal
area south along the I-5 corridor through Lewis County and
westward into Eastern Grays Harbor County, as well as the southern
Portion of the Cascade Foothills. In addition, for some areas
from eastern Grays Harbor County into Mason and Thurston Counties
there is a 10-15% chance of mixed precipitation including light
freezing rain at times late Thursday night. A winter weather
advisory has been issued for these areas from Thursday morning
into Friday morning to highlight the potential for winter weather
impacts. Showers should taper off later Friday morning, perhaps
lingering in the Southern Washington Cascades before moving south
and east of the area by midday leaving the afternoon generally
dry. Low temps Friday morning will be in the low 30s with highs
reaching into the low 40s.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...The next frontal system
will approach Western Washington Saturday bringing a steady
warming, and a shift to mainly lowland rain and mountain
snowfall. Saturday morning`s lows will still be in the low 30s so
a brief mix at the onset of precipitation, mainly around Whatcom
County and the Cascade Foothills is possible. Steady precipitation
and snow levels near the pass levels will result in snow
accumulations there Saturday afternoon through Monday morning of
near a foot. The unsettled - but typical - weather pattern
will continue Monday and potentially into Tuesday as another
trough moves across the Pacific Northwest around midweek.
Temperatures will be near/slightly below normal by early next
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northerly flow aloft will back to west to southwesterly
tonight as a weak upper ridge axis moves onshore and a broad upper
level trough approaches offshore. The air mass will remain quite dry
today with VFR expected areawide into tonight. Easterly winds will
pick up across the region this evening, with breezy E winds
overnight into Thursday. Snow showers will move north into the
region after Thurs/15z with precipitation overspreading most
terminals by Thursday afternoon.

KSEA...VFR with clear skies. Surface winds E/NE 9 to 12 knots this
afternoon and evening with gusts of 15 to 25 knots at times
overnight tonight into early Thursday morning. Forecast models show
a 20% chance of easterly gusts reaching 40 kt at the terminal
between 12z-18z Thurs. Low level wind shear is also possible at KSEA
early Thurs morning. Snow showers will move over the terminal by
early Thursday afternoon and continue through the evening.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A broad surface trough will move into the offshore
waters tonight into Thursday enhancing offshore flow with Small
Craft Advisory easterly winds expected in the west entrance to the
strait and portions of the coastal waters adjacent to gaps in
terrain. The low will weaken as it moves into the Oregon coastal
waters late in week, but seas will rise to 8 to 11 feet over the
outer coastal waters on Friday. A more organized frontal system will
reach the area over the weekend with headlines for both wind and
seas expected.

.PREV DISCUSSION... <span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>/issued 934 AM PST Wed Feb 12 2025/

UPDATE...Dry and cool conditions again today, with very cold
temperatures again overnight. Breezy easterly winds developing
overnight will result in gusty conditions along the gaps in the
Cascades including the foothills. Winds will also help drive down
the apparent temperatures in many locations into Thursday morning
into the teens for many locations and even below 0 at the passes
in the Cascades. There also remains a chance for lowland snow
as precipitation moves into western Washington from the South
Thursday morning, with highest probabilities of accumulations of 1
to 2 in over the Hood Canal area and areas south of Olympia. There
remains 30-40% chance of at least some accumulation as far north
as Snohomish County through early Friday morning. Please see below
for updates to the aviation and marine forecasts.
