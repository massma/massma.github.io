Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
219 PM PDT Tue Apr 8 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Troughing will maintain wet and breezy conditions
across western Washington today. High pressure will develop over
the region late tonight into Wednesday, allowing for brief drying
ahead of the next incoming system Thursday. Troughing will lead to
active weather towards the end of the week before another upper
level ridge develops by the end of the weekend into early next
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough axis
will continue to shift inland over the Pacific Northwest this
afternoon, maintaining widespread shower activity and locally
breezy winds. Showers will continue to pivot eastward into the
evening hours as a cold front continues to slide across the
region, with a slight chance for thunderstorms to develop along
the front. Additional rainfall over the southern slopes of the
Olympics has led to increased flows for the Skokomish River, where
a Flood Warning is currently in effect through Wednesday morning.
Showers will also continue through the evening over the Cascades
with snow levels ranging from 3000 to 4000 feet, and the Winter
Storm Warning remains in effect for portions of the western
Cascades through the afternoon before showers lighten up later
this evening.

As the trough axis pushes eastward, southerly winds will become
breezy this evening, with gusts peaking in the 25 to 35 mph range
for most areas. Post-frontal shower activity will continue into
early Wednesday morning along the coast, while convergence
showers are expected to linger over Snohomish and Skagit Counties
into early Wednesday morning.

A high pressure ridge will amplify over the western US throughout
the day on Wednesday, allowing for drier and warmer conditions
across western Washington. Despite cloudy skies, the interior will
see plenty of sun breaks with highs reaching the upper 50s to low
60s.

The next frontal system will cross the region on Thursday,
bringing in the next chance for widespread precipitation. Snow
levels will stay elevated on Thursday, rising above 5500 to 6000
feet, before a cold front lowers snow levels to 2000 to 3000 feet
by early Friday. Precipitation will be fairly light, with the
lowlands seeing a quarter to a half inch of rainfall and a few
inches of snow accumulation over the higher peaks through Friday.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Ensembles continue to
favor troughing heading into the weekend, with showers continuing
into Saturday as another trough axis passes over the region. This
will bring in another round of locally breezy winds and a chance
for isolated thunderstorms. Temperatures will also cool into the
upper 40s to low 50s across the lowlands.

Forecast models have come into better agreement over drier and
warmer conditions Sunday and Monday as high pressure builds over
the area. Highs are on track to peak in the 60s with mostly clear
skies under the influence of the ridge. Forecast confidence
decreases into Tuesday, as models show timing differences over the
next incoming system. The ECMWF keeps the ridge in place over the
Pacific Northwest well into next week, while the GFS and Canadian
models favor a wetter pattern towards the middle of next week.
Ensembles continue to lean towards a drier solution, with a slight
chance of showers on Tuesday.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly to southwesterly flow aloft as a trough axis
shifts inland over western Washington this afternoon. A front
moving through the region this afternoon has brought widespread
rain along with breezy conditions (gusts up to 25 to 30 kts). A
mixed bag of conditions out there this afternoon with localized
MVFR/IFR ceilings, and with some areas peaking around at VFR.
Expect this trend to linger through most of the afternoon, before
dropping off this evening (23z-02z), where VFR is expected to
rebound.

KSEA...VFR to MVFR conditions out there this afternoon as a front
tracks over the terminal with rain and occasional wind gusts.
Breezy S/SW winds with gusts up to 20 to 25 knots will gradually
taper off this evening maintaining 5 to 10 knots. VFR looks to
continue throughout tonight and into Wednesday morning.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface low has tracked over the coastal waters this
afternoon, leading to small craft southerlies over the coast, and
some of the interior waters this evening. In its wake, latest
guidance shows that winds will turn westerly and push down the
Strait of Juan De Fuca, before tapering off overnight.

Brief surface high pressure will build Wednesday into Thursday
before another frontal system enters the area near the end of the
week.

Combined seas 9 to 11 feet through tonight before subsiding
generally around to 5 to 7 feet by Wednesday, before gradually
building back up to around 10 feet by the end of the week.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Additional showers have caused the Skokomish River to
rise rapidly today, and the river is on track to reach Minor
Flood Stage by mid- afternoon today. A Flood Warning has been
issued for the Skokomish River, which is forecast to peak in Minor
Flood Stage by the late afternoon and recede back into Action
Stage by early Wednesday morning.

Elsewhere, area rivers are forecast to remain below flood stage
over the next 7 days and no flooding outside of the Skokomish
River is expected.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
