.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cooler temperatures on Sunday. A weak frontal system
will move into Western Washington Monday through Tuesday, bringing
light precipitation. Dry and warmer conditions Wednesday through
Thursday with high pressure over the region. Precipitation
chances return Friday into the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
the majority of the morning stratus has dissipated across Western
Washington this afternoon giving way to mostly clear skies.
Temperatures have slowly rebounded this afternoon into the 60s
across the interior.

Breezy conditions this afternoon/evening, primarily along the
Strait of Juan de Fuca, the coast, and southern interior (west of
Olympia). Gusts 20 to 25 mph are possible along the coast and
Strait. Sunday afternoon/evening will also bring breezy
conditions. The highest chances of seeing gusts above 20 mph on
Sunday are along the Strait and southwestern interior locations.

Split flow aloft on Sunday as a low pressure system to our south
moves across California. Temperatures will be cooler with high
temperatures in the upper 50s to low 60s. Upper level ridging
will flatten as it moves eastward towards Washington. Zonal flow
on Monday will give way for a weak frontal system to move across
Western Washington Monday evening into Tuesday. Rain is expected
at the passes as snow levels will be elevated with this system
(5000-6000 ft). QPF amounts will generally be light across the
interior (0.25 in. or less). Slightly higher QPF amounts are
expected along the coast and Cascades (0.25-0.40 in.).

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Upper level ridging is
favored among ensembles Wednesday through Thursday. This will
bring drier and warmer conditions to Western Washington, with NBM
probabilities giving a strong signal (80-95% chance) that high
temperatures on Thursday will exceed 70 degrees along Puget Sound
and southern interior locations.

Precipitation chances return on Friday as ensemble guidance
favors an upper level trough to move into the region. There is
uncertainty regarding QPF amounts at this time as ensemble solutions
begin differ in terms of intensity and timing.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Dry weather across western WA tonight and Sunday as
an upper level low spins to our south and southeast (over CA and
NV). The flow aloft is light northerly. A stronger onshore push
will bring stratus clouds farther inland tonight and Sunday for
IFR to MVFR conditions across the coast and interior. MVFR
conditions may persist longer in the interior Sunday afternoon,
with the coast remaining MVFR. 33

KSEA...SW/W winds 5-10 kt with VFR conditions this evening.
