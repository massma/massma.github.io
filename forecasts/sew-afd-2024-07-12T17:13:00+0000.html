Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge remains over Western Washington
through the weekend into next week with continued low level
onshore flow. This will maintain above normal temperatures, but
still notably cooler than the start of this week. No rain expected
with only subtle variations in the strength of the marine pushes
each night.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Flat upper level ridge over
Western Washington through Sunday with onshore flow in the lower
levels. 500 mb heights staying in the mid to upper 580 dms with
850 mb temperatures in the plus 16C to 20C each day. Varying
degrees of onshore flow with a shallow marine layer keeping the
morning stratus confined to the coast and Lower Chehalis Valley
for the most part. The stratus will retreat to the coastline each
day by midday. Highs in the mid 70s to mid 80s inland with mid 60s
to lower 70s along the coast. Lows in the 50s and lower 60s.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Very little change in the
pattern through the extended period. Weak trofiness developing
well offshore late in the period changing the flow aloft from
westerly to southwesterly. If the trough deepens enough to turn
the flow aloft southerly the threat of convection over the
Southern Cascades could develop Thursday afternoon. That`s a big
if right now. In the lower levels varying degrees of onshore flow
continuing through Thursday. Highs remaining in the mid 70s to mid
80s for the interior and mid 60s to lower 70s for the coast. Lows
in the 50s and lower 60s. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly winds aloft through the period as we`re locked
in zonal flow. Currently, marine stratus is hugging the coast and
causing IFR ceilings at KHQM. Conditions will look to improve
around 18-20z as stratus burns off. Elsewhere, VFR cigs are in
store for much of the upcoming TAF period with the exception of
coastal airfields (KHQM, KUIL, etc.).

KSEA...VFR for the upcoming TAF period. Light winds this morning
increasing out of the NW between 5-10 kt becoming lighter again
tonight into Saturday morning.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Stout surface high pressure remains offshore pushing
low-level onshore winds across area waters. SCA advisory remains
over the outer coastal waters. Diurnal westerlies will persist
into early next week with additional headlines possible for the
Strait. Will have to monitor winds for this area this afternoon as
well.

Seas 6 to 10 ft for the coastal waters with the highest waves over
the outer waters. Seas will then gradually decrease to around 4 to 6
feet into the weekend.
