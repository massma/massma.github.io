Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
332 AM PDT Sat Aug 3 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure aloft through the weekend with
continued above normal temperatures and dry weather. However,
increased onshore flow will bring near-normal conditions on
Tuesday before warming up shortly afterwards. Nearby disturbances
may usher marginal thunderstorm potential over the Cascades into
next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The Four Corners high remains
in place and won`t progress much in the next several days. As a
result, its influence continues here in W WA as dry conditions
reign. At the surface, marine stratus is tracking inland given
latest satellite imagery. Clouds will get to Puget Sound before
burning off readily as the morning progress. For today we`re in
store for more warm temperatures throughout the interior with
highs topping into the mid to upper 80s. It`ll be much cooler
along the coast and San Juans with 60s and 70s in store. CAMs are
showing precipitation tracking northward into the region
throughout the day but SW flow aloft should steer it clear of the
area. Tonight, W WA will see another round of stratus into Sunday
morning with less intrusion. Low temperatures are to range between
to 50s and 60s.

Much of the same for both Sunday and Monday although, a gently
moving shortwave trough will camp out along the coast. This
feature is helping to keep a slight (15%) chance of showers over
the far northern Cascades but current guidance suggest most of the
moisture should stay well east. Can`t rule out a strike of
lightning during this time. Temperatures again are to top out in
the mid to upper 80s with 60s along the coast. Overnight lows of
50s and 60s are to persist as well.


.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Deterministic guidance has
the aforementioned shortwave trough tracking across WA through
Wednesday. Will have to monitor the continued threat for elevation
convection. By Thursday-Friday, ensembles and deterministic
models are hinting at a upper-low drifting southward out of
Alberta/BC and upper-ridging upstream over the NE Pac. Can`t rule
out additional precipitation chances during this time. Ensemble
guidance continues to favor above normal temperatures through the
rest of the forecast period.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong upper ridge centered over the Four Corners
region combined with a weak upper trough offshore will continue to
produce southwest flow aloft over Western Washington today. The low
level flow is onshore. IFR stratus spreading inland from the
coast will reach Puget Sound this morning before burning back to the
coast by around 18Z. Continued onshore flow should bring marine
layer at least partway inland again on Sunday morning.

KSEA...IFR stratus expected to reach the terminal before 12Z and
continue through around 16Z before burning off for VFR the remainder
of the day. Surface winds southwesterly 8 knots or less veering to
west to northwest mid-afternoon into early evening.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>



&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A static summer pattern is expected over the next
several days with a broad surface ridge centered well offshore and
lower pressure inland for varying degrees of onshore flow. Diurnally
driven increases in the westerlies through the strait will come
close to or exceed small advisory levels on a near daily basis.
Persist northwest winds over the outer coastal waters will lead
to some choppy conditions through the weekend. Otherwise, a fairly
quiet period is expected to continue.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
