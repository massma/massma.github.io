Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
821 PM PDT Sat Oct 19 2024

.SYNOPSIS...An atmospheric river continues to bring moderate to
localized heavy rainfall across portions of Western Washington. A
front will move across the area on Sunday for additional breezy
winds and rain. Troughing overhead Monday for additional showers
and cooler temperatures. Drier weather later Tuesday into midweek,
with another system late week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No major forecast
updates have been made this evening, although there are some
hydrologic changes that will be discussed in that section below.
The atmospheric river continues to bring steady rain to the
northern Olympic coast and north interior of western Washington.
Reports from observers and spotters in the north Cascades report
over two inches of rain in the past 24 hours, with totals around
four to six inches in the windward slopes of the Olympics thus
far. The rest of the previous discussion can be found below with
minor updates to timing. Additionally, a hydrology section has
been included, as well as an update to the aviation and marine
sections.

Kristell

The steadiest rain will remain focused on the Olympics and North
Cascades through this evening before shifting northward further
into BC later tonight into Sunday morning. A frontal system will
then move across Western Washington on Sunday for additional
rainfall. Winds will also slowly taper off tonight, but increase
again Sunday morning. HREF suggests 60 to 90% probabilities of
gusts exceeding 45 MPH across the north coast, as well as
Admiralty Inlet, San Juan Islands, and western Whatcom/Skagit
Counties on Sunday. For this reason, another Wind Advisory has
been issued for these areas. Localized power outages and tree
damage is possible. However, the stronger southerly winds will be
relatively brief, at least compared to the previous 24 hours.
Elsewhere, breezy conditions are expected, with gusts ranging 20
to 40 MPH. The front will move east of the Cascades into later
Sunday evening, with lingering convergence zone activity across
portions of Snohomish and northern King Counties.

Troughing will move overhead and weaken on Monday for continued
unsettled weather and lingering showers for the area. In addition,
temperatures will drop 10-15 degrees for most areas on Monday,
with highs only in the mid 50s. Snow levels Monday will be
4000-5000 feet. A few showers may lingering into Tuesday,
especially during the morning, with more split flow aloft.
Otherwise, drier conditions expected into the afternoon with some
sunshine.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Dry weather expected to
continue on Wednesday with light southwest flow aloft.
Temperatures will also remain relatively cool, especially during
the overnight periods, with lows Wednesday and Thursday in the mid
to upper 30s, mainly away from the water. Uncertainty increases
later Thursday into next weekend regarding the influence of
troughing offshore. However, precipitation potential does look to
increase again later Thursday into Friday, and continue into next
weekend. Temperatures look to remain a few degrees cooler than
normal into late next week. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface cold front remains offshore (with the warm
front inland), with strong westerly flow aloft ahead of an incoming
trough. Rain continues this evening, primarily over the northwest
portions of the area, with off-and-on showers elsewhere. Most
terminals have MVFR Ceilings or visibilities (with isolated areas
down to IFR/LIFR) due to rain/mist. The rainy conditions will taper
back overnight tonight to primarily the coast/Olympics up into the
Victoria B.C. area. The lowest ceilings (IFR/LIFR) tonight will
generally be at terminals west and north of Puget Sound, with
remaining areas seeing MVFR or VFR ceilings, and any low ceilings
lifting to MVFR/VFR by Sunday morning. Winds have already begun to
drop down to 5 to 15 kt across the terminals out of the southwest.
The cold front is expected to make its way through western
Washington tomorrow morning, so there will be an uptick in surface
wind speeds between 15Z-18Z, lingering into the early afternoon as
it passes. LLWS will be monitored for inclusion in the TAF if
needed.

KSEA...Rain/Mist has brought conditions down to MVFR this evening.
Gusty winds have subsided (but still remain out of the south at
around 10 kt). The rain will continue through 06-07Z, with most
likely MVFR ceilings remaining through middle of Sunday morning. The
cold front offshore is expected to move over the area tomorrow
morning, with an uptick in surface winds expected around 17Z with
gusts of 20 to 25 kt likely again into the early afternoon. LLWS is
possible with the frontal passage and will be included in the TAF if
conditions are supportive of airspeed gains or losses.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front remains just to the northwest of the coastal
waters today, sending heavy rains and gusty winds throughout the
region. Winds have begun to die down across inland waters (but still
remain breezy out of the south at 10 to 15 kt). The wave heights
this evening over the coastal waters remain around 10 feet at 11
seconds.

Winds will pick up again across the area on Sunday as a cold front
sweeps across the area; new small craft advisories were issued for
some inland waters Sunday (Admiralty Inlet, East Strait of Juan de
Fuca, Northern Inland Water zones). The Small Craft Advisory has
been extended through Sunday afternoon for the coastal waters. A
push of westerlies down the Strait of Juan de Fuca will pick up
following the frontal passage Sunday afternoon, with the strongest
winds persisting through the east entrance Sunday evening. High
pressure will build into early next week, allowing winds to ease for
more tranquil conditions.

Seas 10 to 12 ft will continue through tonight, for which a Small
Craft Advisory remains in effect for the coastal waters, West
Strait, and Grays Harbor Bar through early tonight. Seas will begin
to subside on Sunday and through the beginning of the week, down to
3 to 5 ft by Tuesday and remain like so through the week.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A flood watch was issued for Clallam county with the
emphasis on the Bogachiel River near La Push. A river flood
warning is now in effect for it as it has reached minor flood
stage. Additionally, the hydrologic outlook remains for Whatcom
and Skagit counties. This will be something to watch as the
Nooksack River at Ferndale is now forecast to reach minor flood
stage by late Monday morning. Four to six inches of rain has been
observed on the west slopes of the Olympics and one to four inches
over the north Cascades.

It is important to note the river forecast models often struggle
with the first event of the wet season in terms of balancing
runoff and river flow losses going overbank, so overall conditions
will continue to be closely monitored.
