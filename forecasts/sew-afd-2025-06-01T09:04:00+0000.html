Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
204 AM PDT Sun Jun 1 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper ridging across the NE Pacific will bring
generally dry conditions and temperatures near to slightly
above normal through this week. Temperatures are expected to
warm a bit further next weekend with continued ridging
influence.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A mix of clouds and some
clearing early this morning across Western Washington. Mainly
dry conditions as well, other than a few weak showers east of
Puget Sound. Dry conditions will continue for most areas today
as ridging over the NE Pacific builds into Western Washington.
Troughing across British Columbia will slide southwards into the
Intermountain West later today into tonight, which may result in
a few showers in the vicinity of the North Cascades. Otherwise,
morning clouds for some areas of the lowlands will clear for
afternoon sunshine.

Dry and seasonable conditions are expected Monday and Tuesday
with continued ridging influence and NW flow aloft. Temperatures
through Tuesday will be in the mid 60s to mid 70s with a slow
warming trend each day.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak disturbance
may move across northern Pacific Northwest Wednesday. However,
very little in the way of QPF is expected, with the main impacts
being increased clouds, and perhaps some drizzle along the
coast. Otherwise, the pattern will be largely dominated by the
upper ridge over the NE Pacific through late week. Uncertainty
in ensembles increases a bit more next weekend, however, the
majority of ensembles maintain the upper ridge, resulting in
continued drier conditions and temperatures warming a bit
further during this period. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough axis remains over the region this
morning with westerly flow aloft becoming northwesterly later today
as the trough shifts east of the Cascades. A mixed bag of VFR and
high end MVFR ceilings will persist into mid-morning before
scattering out to VFR areawide this afternoon and evening.

KSEA...Remnant moisture with a trough overhead will lead to a mix of
VFR and tempo high end MVFR ceilings through around 16Z-17Z before
lifting and scattering out this afternoon. Surface winds
northeasterly 5 to 8 knots will become N/NW this afternoon and
rise to 9 to 13 knots. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong surface ridge centered around 700 nautical miles
offshore will remain in place into midweek producing onshore flow
across area waters. The ridge will weaken toward the later half of
the week. Diurnally driven increases in onshore flow will lead to
increases in westerlies each afternoon and evening in the central
and east portions of the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

The persistent onshore flow will generate seas at or above 10 feet
over the outer coastal waters into at least Monday along with some
fairly short periods for steep seas. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
