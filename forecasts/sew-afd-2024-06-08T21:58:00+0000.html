.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge
will continue to shift into the Pacific Northwest this afternoon
for dry and warm conditions. Current satellite imagery shows a
few high clouds moving in from the south with flow aloft mainly
southwesterly. Afternoon high temperatures will climb into the
upper 70s and lower 80s for the interior, while locations near the
coast and other areas of water will stay in the mid 60s to lower
70s with increasing onshore flow in the latter half of the day.

A weak upper level trough with meager moisture will nudge into the
area into Sunday with increasing cloud cover and a slight chance
of showers in the Cascades. Overall, interior locations should
remain dry. Onshore flow will continue, with high temps along the
coast in the low 60s, and high temps in the interior in the low to
mid 70s.

Heading into Monday, a more zonal pattern will develop with dry
conditions and temperatures remaining above normal for the
interior, in the low to mid 70s, and lower 60s for coastal areas.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...A shortwave will move
north of our area Tuesday into Wednesday for increased cloud
cover and increased precipitation chances mainly in the northern
portion of our region. Cooler temps will return as well with highs
in the low to mid 60s. Cluster and ensemble guidance continue to
depict an upper level troughing pattern into next weekend, with
the return of wet and cooler conditions.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge axis will continue to push
inland today, allowing for a weak upper trough to move across
western WA on Sunday. At the surface, a weak frontal system
offshore will dissipate as it approaches the coast tonight. Mid
to high clouds associated with the system continue to stream
overhead this afternoon. Conditions are VFR across the area
terminals and will remain so through this evening. Surface winds
will generally remain light and variable. Increasing onshore flow
tonight will allow for stratus to push inland on Sunday, likely
making its way into the southern Sound terminals between 13-16Z.
MVFR ceilings will be likely for terminals in stratus, with a
return to VFR conditions expected near 18Z.

KSEA...VFR through the TAF period. W/NW wind persisting at 4-7
kt. Winds look to transition back to the S/SW around 5-10 kt
overnight and persist through Sunday morning. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will remain situated across the
northeastern Pacific through the weekend. A weak front approaching
the coast will dissipate as it moves onshore tonight. Onshore
flow will increase this evening with gales expected through the
central and eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca. Another strong
westerly push down is expected down the Strait on Sunday night.
Onshore flow will prevail through Monday as high pressure remains
situated offshore. Another front will cross the area waters on
Tuesday, with high pressure expected to build back into the
coastal waters in its wake.

Seas over the coastal waters continue to hover between 3-5 ft
this afternoon, but will increase towards 7-9 ft tonight into
Sunday. Seas will then subside again Monday, hovering between 3-6
ft before building back towards 6-8 ft Tuesday night. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
