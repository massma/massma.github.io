Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak upper level ridge moving through the area today.
Warm front arriving tonight with trailing front Wednesday.
Another weak upper level ridge trying to build Thursday with warm
front moving by to the north. Tail end of front moving over
Western Washington Friday. Atmospheric river setting up over the
weekend could stay over Western Washington into Monday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
cloudy skies over Western Washington this morning. Doppler radar
has shower activity mostly over the Cascades and in the Cascade
foothills. Temperatures at 3 am/11z were in the upper 30s to mid
40s. The 3 am temperature at Seattle-Tacoma airport of 43 degrees
is warmer than any daily high temperature for Seattle the first
two weeks of the month.

Shower activity coming to an end later this morning with a weak
upper level ridge trying to build over the area. With the
saturated lower levels of the air mass could see pockets of
drizzle this morning. Warm front approaching the coast with rain
out ahead of the front beginning west of Puget Sound in the
afternoon. Highs in the mid 40s to near 50.

Warm front moving through the area tonight for rain at times.
Rainfall amounts from a half inch to an inch along the coast with
a tenth to a quarter of an inch inland. Snow levels in the
Cascades around 3000 feet but with the precipitation arriving
late in the evening new snow totals will be light, just a couple
of inches. Lows in the lower to mid 40s.

Trailing occluded front reaching the area Wednesday for more rain
in the lowlands and snow in the mountains. Snow levels rising a
little, closer to 3500 feet instead of 3000 feet, with Western
Washington in the warm sector for a bit. Easterly gradient
increasing with the approach of the front with the cross cascades
down to near -10 mb in the morning. Easterly winds in the passes
will put a thin layer of cold air near the surface of Snoqualmie
Pass creating the possibility of a little freezing rain. Breezy
conditions in the Cascade Foothills as well as the coast ahead of
the front. Highs near 50.

Frontal passage late afternoon/early Wednesday evening. Not much
cold air behind the front with another warm front on the heels of
the front eating up most of the post frontal cold air. This will
limit the post frontal shower activity Wednesday night. Lows a
couple of degrees either side of 40.

Another weak upper level ridge trying to build over Western
Washington Thursday. While the operational runs have the warm
front far enough to the north to keep Western Washington dry the
ensembles are not so confident with a few wet solutions. Will go
with chance pops for most of the area Thursday. Highest pops in
the Cascade Foothills for a few lingering morning showers and
over the Northwest Interior. Highs in the lower to mid 50s.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Warm front dissipating to the
north Friday with the trailing cold front weakening as it moves
through what is left of the upper level ridge later Friday into
Friday night.

Atmospheric river scenario setting up Saturday with the river
remaining over Western Washington at least through Sunday making
for a wet weekend. Snow levels rising into the 6000 to 7000 foot
range with rivers rising across the area. See hydrology discussion
for more details.

Extended models have two different solutions for Monday. The
ECMWF has the atmospheric river dying out over Western Washington.
The GFS shuts off the atmospheric river Sunday night then brings
an additional weather system through the area Monday. Either way
it`s another wet day. Ensemble solutions leaning towards the GFS
right now. This scenario lowers the snow levels down to around
5000 feet, still above pass levels keeping the precipitation in
the passes in the form of rain. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The flow aloft will be west to northwesterly today
as a weak upper ridge axis pushes onshore. The flow aloft will back
to southwesterly and increase tonight as a frontal system approaches
the region. Plentiful low level moisture remains in place across
Western Washington this morning. This along with light surface winds
are producing low MVFR and IFR ceilings as well as pockets of LIFR
fog. Ceilings will briefly improve to VFR across portions of the
interior this afternoon and early evening before sinking back to
MVFR areawide in increasing rain ahead of the next front. Gusty
surface winds will develop this evening along the coast.

KSEA...A mix of MVFR and IFR this morning is expected to briefly
lift to VFR 21Z to 03Z before sinking back to MVFR in increasing
rain this evening. Surface winds southerly 4 to 7 knots becoming
E/SE 8 to 11 knots tonight.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A warm front will lift northward across the offshore
waters tonight ahead of a deepening surface trough. A weakening
occluded front will move onshore Wednesday afternoon. Gales are
expected tonight over the outer coastal waters and near the west
entrance to the strait with small craft advisory conditions for
the remainder of the inner coastal waters and the Strait of Juan
de Fuca. Surface ridging will briefly rebuild across the waters
Wednesday night into early Thursday before the next in a series of
fronts moves across the waters later on Friday. Additional
systems will follow over the weekend. Coastal seas will briefly
drop below 10 feet today before building back above 10 feet
tonight into Wednesday and again during the active period Friday
through the weekend. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A pair of frontal systems will move across Western
Washington through Friday. Snow levels will remain in the 3000 to
4000 ft range. No river flooding forecast with the Skokomish
river rising into action stage Wednesday and remaining there into
the weekend.

Models continuing to show atmospheric river event this weekend
with the atmospheric river possibly remaining over the area into
Monday. Snow levels rising to 6000 to 7000 feet. Widespread river
rises with the possibility of flooding along the Skokomish River
and other rivers flowing off the Olympics like the Satsop and the
Bogachiel beginning Sunday. Hydrographs now indicating numerous
rivers flowing off the Central and Southern Cascades getting to action
stage Sunday into Monday. The current hydrograph has the Snoqualmie
at Carnation cresting near flood stage Monday. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.CLIMATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The last time Seattle had an inch or more of rain in
a day was December 5th, 2023 ( 2.39 inches ). 2024 was the first
year since records started at Seattle-Tacoma airport in 1945 where
there wasn`t at least one one inch plus rain day in the year. The
current 440 day streak without a one inch plus rain day is the
3rd longest on record. The longest is 586 days ( Jan 15, 1976 to
August 22, 1977 ). Second longest 582 days ( March 23, 1993 to
Oct. 25, 1994 ). Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
