Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
850 AM PDT Sat Apr 12 2025

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light shower activity continues this morning across
Western Washington and the convergence zone earlier this morning
has dissipated. Showers will taper off later this evening.
Outside of showers, mostly clear to partly cloudy skies. Otherwise,
no significant updates to the forecast. Please refer to an
updated aviation section below.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...A trough will pass through western Washington today,
triggering a few showers in the lowlands, and snow showers in the
mountains. High pressure will build back in the region Sunday
through next week. The morning temperatures will be chilly this
weekend, with many areas seeing lows in the 30s Sunday morning
with frost. Improvements will occur by Monday with highs
returning into the 60s through the week.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper air analysis shows a
trough just offshore western WA this morning that will slide
through our region today. Not a whole lot in the way of frontal
systems at the surface, but at 500 mb, a vorticity max will be
sufficient enough to keep shower activity going throughout the day
today. The focus of this activity will transition towards the
Cascades during the day today. With snow levels abnormally low
post-cold front (for this time of year) at around 2,000 ft, some
snow showers will be likely in the Cascades today. Snow totals
will be very light - just an inch or two at Stevens/Snoqualmie
Passes.

The next topic of concern this weekend is cool air and frost
concerns. Behind the trough, a ridge will quickly follow into the
region and propagate eastward through early next week. The initial
transition between the trough/ridge will take place early Sunday.
The associated jet max with the ridge will help funnel cooler air
from Canada into western WA. Winds are very quiet across the
region this morning, and will remain light northerly through the
weekend.

This morning: sky coverage was a mix of clouds and clear skies
across most of western WA. The Chehalis valley was one of the
clearest areas forecasted for Saturday morning, and this has been
true so far with the cooler temperatures in the upper 30s as of
230 AM this morning. The lowest temperatures are expected just
before sunrise, and the current frost advisory headline in this
area remains on track for Saturday morning. Areas with
showers/increased clouds had temperatures in the mid 40s early
this morning. Highs today will again only reach the mid 50s for
the lowlands.

The NBM for tonight/Sunday morning increased the amount of
clearing expected for a majority of western WA. As a result,
low temperatures Sunday morning dropped a degree or two in most
spots. Most areas will see lows in the 30s (upper 30s close to
water, and low to mid 30s the further away from the water you
are). Given that dew points will be at or just below freezing
(along with calm or light winds and clear skies), the most likely
result (meteorologically speaking) will be frost formation for
areas that get cold enough (32-36 ambient temperatures). The
frost advisory for tonight/Sunday morning was expanded to include
all valley areas close to the Cascades, Lake Crescent area, as
well as Shelton/Olympia, and adjacent areas east of Everett and
east of Bellingham (away from the water). A freeze is not
expected, but the Chehalis Valley region did have a 40% chance of
seeing temperatures lower than 32 degrees Sunday morning. For
areas that have dew points above freezing, there will be a chance
of some fog development in the morning (does not appear to be
widespread at this time).

The ridge axis will slide over western WA Sunday night into
Monday. Temperatures will have a good recovery on Sunday, with
highs expected to get back into the upper 50s and low 60s in the
lowlands. Clouds filling back in Sunday night into Monday will
keep lows Sunday night in the upper 30s to low 40s, with highs on
Monday climbing back into the mid and upper 60s (can`t rule out a
couple 70s too!).

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The dry and slightly warmer
weather will continue through much of next week with intervals of
clouds and sun and clear skies through the week. An very weak
trough passing through Tuesday/Wednesday to the north is not
expected to produce any precipitation over the region (but will be
enough to drop temperatures a few degrees Tuesday and Wednesday).
Another ridge will build back in Wednesday through the end of the
week, with temperatures climbing back up into the mid and upper
60s. A couple ensembles hint a chance of showers next weekend,
but confidence is very low at this time. Lows in the lowlands are
not expected to drop below the upper 30s in this period.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft will become more northwesterly
today as an upper trough exits the region and upper ridging
builds in from the Pacific. Radar shows some convergence zone
persisting across the central Sound early this morning. Terminals
within this shower activity are mostly reporting MVFR conditions.
Otherwise, outside of shower activity, area terminals are
primarily VFR. Showers will continue through the morning hours,
but look to gradually become more confined to the Cascades through
the day before completely tapering by tonight as high pressure
builds in. Terminals in shower activity look to rebound to VFR by
this afternoon and expect the majority of the area terminals to
remain VFR into Saturday morning.

KSEA...VFR conditions expected through the much of the TAF period.
Winds variable this morning, then increasing out of the W/NW this
afternoon and veering to the N/NE, persisting at 5-10 kt through
this evening.

33/14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...High pressure will build over the northeastern Pacific
today into Sunday, generally promoting calm conditions for the
majority of the area waters. Onshore flow will increase again this
afternoon and evening however, for another round of small craft
strength westerlies through the Strait of Juan de Fuca. A thermal
trough looks to build along the Washington coast late Sunday into
Monday, allowing for flow to briefly turn offshore by early Monday.
A weakening frontal system will then approach the region Monday
afternoon, but looks to break up over the region and does not
look to have much of an impact across the area waters at this
time. High pressure will then quickly build back into the region
in its wake and will interact with lower pressure inland into
midweek.

Seas hovering between 6-8 ft early this morning will continue to
subside towards 4-6 ft by Sunday. Seas then look to build towards
10-13 ft Tuesday into Wednesday as a westerly swell arrives into
the region.
