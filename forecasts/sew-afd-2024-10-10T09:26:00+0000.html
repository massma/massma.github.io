.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A building upper level ridge will lead to drier
conditions and a gradual warming trend through the upcoming
weekend. The ridge will break down early next week for increasing
chances of rain and cooler temperatures.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Only a couple showers
remain early this morning across portions of the north and central
Cascades. These will dissipate before dawn and a gradually
building upper ridge will lead to drier conditions across Western
Washington today. After areas of morning low clouds clear out,
varying degrees of high clouds will continue to stream across the
region today into Friday as the upper ridge remains somewhat
dirty. Upper ridging gains some amplitude heading into the
weekend and the low level flow turns weakly offshore. This should
give the area less in the way of cloud cover (apart from areas of
morning fog) and boost high temperatures back to a little above
normal. This bodes well for catching a possible glimpse of Comet
Tsuchinshan-ATLAS shortly after sunset Saturday evening.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...The dry and mild pattern
continues into Sunday as the upper ridge axis continues to shift
east of the region. And then the inevitable reality that is
autumn in Western Washington begins to take shape. There is near
unanimous agreement amongst the ensembles that a shift toward
wetter and cooler conditions will begin on Monday and continue
through most of next week as a broad upper trough digs southward
into the area. By the middle of next week, highs cooling into the
50s look probable for most of the lowlands with widespread lows
in the 40s. And the higher elevations of the Cascades and Olympics
look set to receive their first noteworthy snowfall of the
season. And so it begins. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak high pressure over the region today for dry and
stable weather. The low level air mass remains moist with pockets
of low clouds and fog this morning. Expect VFR conditions this
afternoon with mainly high clouds aloft. 33

KSEA...MVFR cigs this morning, becoming VFR by 18z. Winds N around
5 kt, increasing to 8-10 kt by 21z. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light offshore winds today as high pressure
shifts inland. The next frontal system will weaken over the
offshore waters on Friday, with offshore flow prevailing through
the weekend. A cold front will move inland on Monday with
increasing southerly flow and seas building to 10 to 13 feet. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
