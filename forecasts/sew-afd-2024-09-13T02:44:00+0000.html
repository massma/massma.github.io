Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
744 PM PDT Thu Sep 12 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak upper level ridging will allow for drier
conditions tonight before another upper level trough enters the
region Friday. Wet, cooler, and unsettled conditions will continue
through the weekend. Next week will start with brief drying ahead of
another wet system, maintaining below-normal temperatures through
the period.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mid level clouds scattered
over W WA this evening...otherwise fairly uneventful. Temperatures
as of 7 PM PDT generally ranging from the upper 50s to lower 60s
which is on track for overnight lows from inherited forecast.
Lingering low level moisture will likely allow for some low cloud
development overnight.

No plans for an evening update as forecast looks to be on track. For
additional forecast details, please refer to Previous Discussion
section below.

From Previous Discussion...Cloudy skies with isolated shower
activity south and east of the Puget Sound will persist today under
northwest flow aloft. Onshore flow will cause cloudy skies to stick
around, with periodic sun breaks in the afternoon. High temperatures
today will stay on the cool side but will increase a degree or two
from yesterday, peaking in the mid to upper 60s for much of the
lowlands.

Flow will flatten overnight into Friday as weak ridging passes
over the region. The next system will move into the Pacific
Northwest later in the day, with a front and associated showers
moving onto the coast by the late afternoon. Showers will
overspread western Washington by late Friday evening with a
surface front sliding across the area Saturday afternoon. The bulk
of the moisture will be focused over the North Cascades, where
weak instability will allow for locally heavier showers and may
produce a few lightning strikes. Convergence zone showers are
also favored to develop Saturday evening over and east of the
Puget Sound while activity decreases elsewhere. Temperatures will
remain below normal through the short-term in the mid 60s for most
low elevations.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...From Previous Discussion...An
upper level trough will dive south of the region on Sunday,
maintaining cooler temperatures and generating more scattered shower
activity across western Washington. Split flow will develop overhead
by Monday as ridging amplifies from the west, allowing conditions to
briefly dry out and warm up a few degrees. Uncertainty increases
heading into next week, though ensembles continue to highlight
another storm system moving into the region on Tuesday with another,
potentially heavier, round of precipitation across western
Washington. Cooler temperatures will also persist, remaining several
degrees below normal for mid-September.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow aloft will persist tonight with an
upper level ridge over the region. Flow aloft will become more
westerly through the day on Friday as the ridge flattens and a
trough sinks down into the region from the north. Onshore flow
will continue in the low levels through the period.

Widespread VFR conditions over the majority of W WA with MVFR
conditions already present along the coast. Ceilings expected to
lower area-wide overnight into Friday morning, with most terminals
likely becoming MVFR with IFR conditions possible along the coast
and those terminals that favor lower cigs. Conditions will improve
and return to widespread VFR between 18-20Z Friday.

KSEA...VFR conditions in place this evening and early tonight.
Redevelopment of low stratus is expected by Friday morning, with
probabilistic guidance showing a 45-50 percent chance of MVFR
conditions developing at the terminal near 12Z. Winds are W/SW at 4-
8 kts and will become light again overnight. 14/18<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure will continue to build into the
coastal waters tonight, with onshore flow expected to persist
over the next several days. Westerly winds along the Strait of Juan
de Fuca will increase to 10-20 kt this evening. Conditions in the
Strait remain very much marginal when it comes to inherited SCA,
however, still seeing occasional gusts at scattered sites within the
advisory area as well as Race Rocks remaining just above criteria.
As such, will leave headline in place for now. Winds will diminish
again late tonight through early Friday morning.

A weak system will sink southward and move into British Columbia
Friday into the weekend. This will push a weak cold front through
the area waters Friday night into Saturday. Increased onshore flow
will persist in its wake, so may see another round of gusty
westerly winds along the Strait Saturday night into Sunday. High
pressure then looks to build back into the coastal waters early
next week, before another system moves into the area waters on
Tuesday.

Seas are generally hovering between 4-7 ft this evening and will
continue to subside towards 3-5 ft again by the weekend. Seas then
look to build back towards 5-8 ft again across the outer coastal
waters by early next week. 14/18<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
