Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
1058 AM EDT Fri Apr 4 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Brief high pressure builds in through early tonight. Thereafter,
a triple-point low brings a warm front on Saturday followed by
a cold front early on Sunday, which stalls to our south Sunday
afternoon/evening. Weak waves of low pressure track along the
stalled frontal boundary Sunday night and Monday. Another cold
front pushes through the area Monday night into Tuesday. High
pressure returns for Wednesday before pushing offshore by late
Thursday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow kicks in behind the departing cold front,
leading to drier air filtering in. Rain will stay farther south
in central/southern New Jersey where moisture is better
available south of the front.

An upper-level ridge builds in this afternoon and into the night.
Cloud cover will decrease this morning, remaining partly cloudy this
afternoon and into tonight.

Temperatures were running a few degrees warms so have bumped up
hourlies and MaxT. Although some cold advection kicks in, not
expecting it to beat out daytime heating, especially with
gradual thinning and clearing of clouds from north to south.
Tonight will be cooler than previously under some cold air
advection with lows in the mid/low-40s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
On Saturday, an upper-level ridge remains in place, then begins to
weaken and exit east under lowering heights Saturday night into
Sunday in response to a long-wave trough that moves east to our
north in Canada.

A triple point surface low will approach us from the west early on
Saturday then move nearby to our north late Saturday/early Sunday,
exiting northeast into Sunday. This triple point low will bring a
warm front on Saturday followed by a cold front overnight Saturday
or early on Sunday. The warm front brings the next best chance for
rain Saturday afternoon/evening with a bit of a lull late Saturday
night until rain chances pick up again early on Sunday with the
passage of the cold front. Spotty rain chances may linger somewhat
through Sunday as the front stalls to our south with pockets of
energy passing aloft before the next system approaches to the
southwest Sunday evening/night.

Cool air will still be in place before the warm front arrives on
Saturday, leading to highs in the low-50s to upper-40s. Then due to
the warm front and rainfall, temperatures will remain mostly steady
Saturday night, with lows staying in the 40s. Uncertainty remains
for high temperatures on Sunday. The 03Z NBM 25th has highs for KNYC
at 57 while the 03Z NBM 75th has highs up to 77. This is a 20 degree
spread for high temperatures on Sunday, and it mainly has to do with
the timing of the cold front. Having gone with the slightly earlier
timing for the front, temperatures should be more limited on Sunday.
Forecast highs to be in the low-60s to upper-50s. This is subject to
change, however, depending on how guidance trends with regards to
the timing of the cold front, which will eventually stall to the
south Sunday evening.

&&

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...
A longwave trough builds toward the region Sunday night through
Tuesday, and moves offshore Tuesday night into Wednesday. At the
surface a cold front pushes through the region Sunday and stalls
somewhere in the vicinity, with most guidance indicating the front
stale just south of the area. With waves of low pressure tracking
along the frontal boundary unsettled weather is likely Sunday night
into Monday. With the uncertainties with the setup of the front,
have leaned toward the NBM deterministic guidance. Although for
Monday went a little toward the 75th percentile for highs, if the
front setup up a little further to the north. A rather strong
shortwave rotates into the upper trough Monday night into Tuesday,
and this brings another cold front across the region Tuesday.
However there is little moisture with this front. With this front
bringing a cold airmass into the entire region, temperatures Tuesday
and Tuesday night will be 5 to 10 degrees below normal. Tuesday
night, freezing temperatures are expected across the region, except
for metro New York City, where temperatures will be just above
freezing. And with the growing season having begun in the NYC metro
area, frost and/or freeze headlines are possible for Tuesday night.
Temperatures remain below normal through Wednesday night, and return
to near normal Thursday as surface high pressure builds off the
coast. Also, gusty northwest winds in the wake of the front will
produce wind chills from around 15 to 25 degrees.

.AVIATION /14Z FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front just to our south will settle over the Mid
Atlantic states by this evening before lifting back to the north
late tonight into Saturday. At the same time, high pressure
will build in from the NW today, passing to the north and east
tonight.

VFR. Showers will again be possible toward 12Z Saturday as a
warm front approaches.

Wind NW around 10 kt this morning with occasional gusts to
15-20kt late morning into the early afternoon. Winds diminish
after sunset and veer to the north then northeast overnight,
becoming east toward 12Z Saturday.

.MARINE...
Small craft advisories remain in place on ocean waters early this
morning for waves 5-7 feet, but waves are expected to drop below 5
feet west to east later this morning and into the early evening west-
to-east, with the SCAs expiring in response.

Waves remain below 5 feet until Sunday where they may climb
above 5 feet on ocean waters. Winds remain below SCA criteria,
but could come close on ocean waters, and possibly non-ocean
waters Saturday with a passing warm front and Sunday with a
passing cold front.

Sunday night ocean seas remain elevated near 5 feet, especially on
the eastern ocean waters, with a northwest flow, becoming northeast
Monday. Another cold front moving through Monday night into Tuesday
with bring gusty SCA level winds to the ocean waters by late Monday
night and through Tuesday, with ocean seas building to 5 to 6 feet.
Small craft conditions remain on the ocean waters into Tuesday
night, slowly diminishing overnight, and falling below advisory
levels late Tuesday night into early Wednesday as a high builds
towards the waters.
