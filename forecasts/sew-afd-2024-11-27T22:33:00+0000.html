.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light isolated showers possible today, tapering off by
the evening hours. A weak weather system on Friday will bring
cooler air and light precipitation to portions of the region.
Drier conditions expected into early next week as a surface high
pressure begins to settle over the region this weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Current radar shows some
light isolated showers moving through portions of the region.
Precipitation chances should decrease into the evening. Partly to
mostly cloudy skies tonight. Low level moisture and light winds
will bring another round of patchy fog possible in the southern
interior on Thursday morning. On Thanksgiving Day, northerly winds
will advect drier air into the region, limiting precipitation
chances along most of Western Washington. NBM guidance is showing
some chances of precipitation in northern Olympic Peninsula (20%
to 30%). However, any precipitation that does occur will be light.

A weak disturbance will move south on Friday from British Columbia
bringing precipitation chances and slightly cooler air to the
region. Higher PoPs are limited mainly to the northern Olympic
Peninsula and northern Cascades (30% to 50%). Any precipitation
that does occur will be light and should pose no significant
impacts. Precipitation chances will decrease as Friday progresses
and Saturday should remain relatively dry. High pressure building
in the Pacific will gradually begin to shift east and settle
over the area on Saturday.

Mostly to partly cloudy skies are expected to continue throughout
the week. High temperatures will be in the 40s. Low temperatures
will be in the 30s, with the coldest spots being in the southern
interior.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...The upper ridge will
continue to build across the Pacific Northwest on Sunday allowing
for continued dry conditions, with areas of fog in the morning.
Ensembles begin to diverge a bit early next week in regards to the
magnitude of ridging, or if the ridge flattens allowing for more SW
flow aloft. NBM begins to introduce precip chances on Monday,
although only approximately 25% of ensemble members suggest
measurable QPF through 00z Tuesday. Otherwise, continued uncertainty
exists Tuesday and Wednesday with further increase in precipitation
probabilities due to a more SW flow component aloft, despite a
continued ridging influence. Temperatures will be slightly below
normal on Sunday and a few degrees above normal the middle of next
week. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow aloft as an upper level ridge builds
across the northeast Pacific and into western Washington. Ceilings
are slowly beginning to break up and rise, with mostly MVFR ceilings
being observed early this afternoon. Periods of low-end VFR
conditions are possible later this afternoon and into early this
evening as ceilings continue to slowly rise and break up. The
forecast remains on track for areas of fog to develop, most notably
across the Southwest Interior and portions of the Kitsap Peninsula,
through more fog could develop in the morning approaching the
Seattle area and the other fog-prone valleys (including PAE and HQM).

Winds remain very light (5 kt or less), somewhat variable as the
direction veers throughout the day, with mostly calm conditions
expected tonight.

KSEA...MVFR to VFR conditions this afternoon with ceilings slowly
lifting and scattering out. Conditions should trend towards VFR for
the rest of the afternoon and early evening before ceilings begin to
lower again to MVFR. There remains a 15-25% chance of LIFR/fog
conditions, potentially as early as 09Z Thursday but focused
primarily on the 12-19Z time range. Fog may be able to clear
Thursday morning after 19Z, but MVFR CIGs will likely persist into
the early afternoon. Winds remain light today (5 kt or less),
currently southwesterly and expected to gently veer throughout the
day to northerly by this evening then back to easterly overnight.
Winds look to remain light on Thursday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will continue to dominate over the coastal
waters through the rest of the week and into the weekend. A weak
system will just clip the region to the north on Friday. The next
system to move through the area does not look to arrive until early
next week. Another round of fog development is expected early
Tuesday morning, primarily impacting areas of Puget Sound and Hood
Canal. Winds remain light northwesterly across the coastal waters
through the week, becoming southerly this weekend. Seas 2 to 4 ft
through the week, increasing to 6 to 8 ft this weekend as long
period swell arrives to the area from a system over Alaska.
