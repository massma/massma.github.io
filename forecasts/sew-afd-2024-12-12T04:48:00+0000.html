Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
848 PM PST Wed Dec 11 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A weak disturbance will move into the region tonight,
bringing lowland rain and light snow to the mountains. A stronger
system will move into the region Friday into Saturday and will
bring the potential for gusty winds, lowland rain, and mountain
snow. Active weather will persist into early next week as
additional systems move across the region.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Increasing rain from
south to north with a weak system lifting across the area. Some
patches of fog have also developed in the South Sound and near
Port Townsend, but these aren`t terribly widespread and with the
arriving weather system expect a low stratus to be more common
than dense fog. Forecast remains on track as a result with no
updates this evening. Previous discussion follows and details the
array of potential weather hazards in store for the weekend.

The bulk of the energy with this system remains focused on
northern California, so expect precipitation to remain rather
light. With snow levels hovering between 2500-3500 feet, expect
snow accumulations of 1-3 inches to be possible for the Cascade
passes.

Another, stronger system will move into the region Friday night
into the weekend. This system will bring the potential for gusty
winds, lowland rain, and mountain snow. In addition to this,
coastal flooding and high surf is expected to impact areas along
the Pacific Coast. Details on these hazards have been outlined
below:

LOWLAND RAIN: Expect more widespread lowland rain to move into
western Washington starting Friday morning as this system moves
through the area. The heaviest rain will be focused along the
coast and the southwestern slopes of the Olympics. While area
rivers will rise, only the Skokomish River is currently expected
to reach minor flood stage over the weekend. For more info on
river flooding, see the hydrology section below.

MOUNTAIN SNOW: Snow levels across the Cascades will start out
between 3000-3500 ft on Friday and will hover near pass level
throughout the day Saturday, before falling to around 2500 ft on
Sunday. Light snow accumulations will be expected throughout the
weekend for the Cascade passes and could result in minor travel
delays at times. There remains some uncertainty in regards to the
snowfall amounts for Snoqualmie Pass as easterly winds look to
pick up on Friday night, and could keep snow levels initially lower
than 3000 ft.

GUSTY WINDS: Winds will start to increase Friday evening and look
to peak overnight into Saturday. Winds will then gradually ease
through the day Saturday. The strongest winds are expected to be
along the Pacific Coast, Whidbey Island, the San Juan Islands, and
western Skagit and Whatcom counties, where wind gusts to 35-45
mph will be possible.

COASTAL FLOODING: Coastal flooding will be possible starting
Friday and persisting through the weekend during the late morning
to mid-day high tides. Significant coastal flooding will be
possible along the Pacific Coast on Saturday with an inundation of
2-3 ft above ground level possible. Large waves building along the
Pacific coast could exacerbate impacts to coastal communities.

HIGH SURF: Large waves will build towards 15 to 18 feet at around
15 to 16 seconds along the Pacific Coast on Saturday. Large waves
may wash over beaches, jetties, and other structures unexpectedly.
Localized beach erosion will be possible. 14

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Deterministic models and
ensemble members in agreement on a weak upper level ridge entering
the PNW Sunday...although timing has some minor variations. Majority
of solutions also pointing toward this feature not being strong
enough to entirely dry conditions out, with PoPs lingering in the
Chance range. This feature hits the bricks pretty quickly as next
frontal system reaches the coastline by late Monday morning. The
upper level low associated with this front pulls northward and opens
up as rainfall becomes more widespread over W WA, leading to more
showery activity with light precip amounts for Tuesday. There are
hints at an upper level ridge come Wednesday, but there is a wide
array of solutions regarding its strength. The consensus however
seems to be pointing to more of a dirty ridge...as clouds and at
least some lingering precip remain over W WA.

Daytime highs Sunday and Monday largely remain in the lower to mid
40s with overnight lows in the mid to upper 30s. Tuesday and
Wednesday will see a slight nudge upward with highs in the mid to
upper 40s, however this will not impact nighttime lows, remaining in
the mid to upper 30s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>South-southwesterly flow aloft tonight becoming somewhat
westerly by Thursday morning as a upper level trough gradually
approaches W WA. Surface winds generally light and variable with
speeds 5 kts or less. The exceptions to this are HQM, with easterly
winds 8-12 kts and PAE also easterly but a little less at 5-10 kts.
The expectation is that PAE winds will ease tonight to 5 kts or
less, while keeping the easterly direction.

VFR conditions in place for majority of W WA this evening although
seeing some IFR conditions emerge in the SW interior and OLM,
resulting in typical fog/vis restrictions there. A lingering patch
of low clouds also present along the Strait having some occasional
impact to CLM and periods of MVFR to IFR conditions. This area is
expected to see some improvement tonight, but will need to monitor
as this patch has been very stubborn throughout the day. Cigs
gradually eroding overnight and Thursday morning with approaching
weak front yet still remaining largely VFR. MVFR conditions will
spread west to east with precip starting in the late morning and
carrying over into the remainder of the TAF period.

KSEA...VFR conditions persist through Thursday morning. Mid to high
level clouds will continue to stream in ahead of an approaching
front. Light easterly winds turning more southerly Thursday
afternoon with the arrival of rain and low MVFR clouds.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak splitting front will impact the coastal waters
tonight into Thursday morning, bringing increased southerlies and
seas building upwards to 10 to 12 feet. Interior waters will see
these southerlies emerge by Thursday afternoon with speeds remaining
below any headline thresholds.

A stronger storm system will then cross the waters Friday night
into Saturday, with gale force winds possible across the coastal
waters. As such, a Gale Watch remains in effect. Elsewhere, small
craft southerlies are likely at the entrances of the Strait of Juan
De Fuca, the Northern Inland waters and Admiralty Inlet.

Coastal seas 5 to 8 feet will start to build upwards to 8 to 12
feet later tonight into Thursday. Seas will then rapidly build
upwards to 18 to 22 feet, with the higher seas (20-22 feet) being
particularly in the outer coastal zones. In the inner water
zones, seas will be around 15 to 18 feet.

.HYDROLOGY...Next round of precipitation with a weak system
Thursday will only result in small rises on the rivers. A stronger
storm will set up along the coast over the weekend with the
potential to bring more significant precipitation to the region.
While area rivers will rise, only the Skokomish River is currently
expected to reach minor flood stage Saturday into early Sunday.
Additional rounds of precipitation could keep the Skokomish river at
or near flood stage into early next week.
