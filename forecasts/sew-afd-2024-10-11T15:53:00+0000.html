Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
853 AM PDT Fri Oct 11 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge will provide dry conditions and
a gradual warming trend through the upcoming weekend. The ridge
will break down early next week for increasing chances of rain and
cooler temperatures as a series of frontal systems reach the
area.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low clouds/patchy dense fog continues this morning for
most of the region this morning (particularly along and east of
the I-5 corridor). Much of it has lifted and will continue to burn
off through the morning hours, transitioning to mostly clear skies
this afternoon. Rest of the weekend remains dry with precipitation
returning next week (see discussion below for more details).

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...High clouds cleared just
enough to afford much of Western Washington some excellent views
of the aurora overnight. After areas of low clouds dissipate
later this morning, considerable high cloudiness will continue
to spread across Western Washington today into tonight as an
upper level low cuts off well to our southwest. Upper level
ridging will strengthen over the upcoming weekend and the low
level flow will remain weakly offshore. This will lead to more
sunshine and a modest warming trend Saturday into Sunday. Areas
of low clouds will remain a fixture each morning as nights grow
longer and nighttime inversions set up. Weather conditions remain
favorable for those hoping to catch a glimpse of comet
Tsuchinshan-ATLAS before it dips below the horizon Saturday
evening.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Ensembles continue to
strongly support a sharp change in the longwave pattern next
week. Upper ridging over the interior West will finally give way
as it eventually does in autumn and a broad upper trough will dig
southward from the Gulf of Alaska. The first of a series of
frontal systems will spread precip onshore Monday afternoon into
Monday night. A more potent front will follow Tuesday into
Wednesday with some pretty healthy QPF and locally gusty winds.
An upper trough axis is slated to shift onshore by the middle of
the coming week with heights falling into the mid 540s dam and
snow levels tumbling to at or below 5000 feet. Showery conditions
are likely to continue into Thursday as the upper trough axis
remains overhead. By this time next week, it wouldn`t be
at all surprising to see some fresh snow on the ground at some of
the higher passes...(i.e. Stevens). The switch to the wet season
will be effectively be put in the "ON" position. 27

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft will continue today with weak high
pressure over the area and an upper low moving towards OR/CA. Low
clouds and fog remain in place across the Puget Sound lowlands and
extending into the Southwest Interior, but is already beginning to
show signs of rising and lifting. Ceilings should slow scatter out
this morning between 18-20z with VFR high clouds later in the
afternoon and evening. Light N/NE winds early this morning with
light N/NW winds for most this afternoon. With decreasing clouds
tonight and light winds, rapid cooling should allow for another
round of widespread fog and low clouds across the area developing
early tomorrow morning.

KSEA...LIFR conditions in fog continue this morning, with
improvements generally beginning between 18-19z. Cigs expected to
improve to VFR high clouds by 19-20z, and continue through the
afternoon. Light N winds this morning will become more NW this
afternoon. Expecting another round of fog/low ceilings to develop
early tomorrow morning. JD/LH<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper ridge will continue into the weekend for
Western Washington, which will result in more of a north to
offshore flow pattern into Saturday. East winds will likely peak
over the western Strait of Juan de Fuca today, but remain below
SCA threshold. Winds will generally remain lighter for the
interior waters through Saturday. Southerly winds will begin to
increase on Sunday with an approaching front that will move
through the area into Monday. Although most areas are expected to
remain SCA with the front Sunday into Monday, there is
approximately a 30 to 50% of SCA wind gusts for the outer Coastal
Waters during this period. Otherwise, a more active weather
pattern looks to return during the middle of next week for periods
of increased winds.

Seas of 3 to 5 feet will continue through Friday night. Seas will
then build 5 to 7 feet Saturday and Sunday. Seas will build further
Sunday night into Tuesday with the frontal system, likely reaching
10 to 13 feet on Monday before subsiding later Tuesday. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Signals for two atmospheric rivers early next week are
appearing in the forecast. The first will arrive late Sunday night
into Monday, and a second following in short succession Tuesday into
Wednesday. The second one looks to be somewhat stronger in terms of
integrated water vapor transport into western Washington. The
concern with two atmospheric rivers over a short duration relates to
flooding and the QPF will need to be monitored closely over the next
few forecasts in order to determine which basins are at most risk
for elevated river flows or possible flooding. The storm total QPF
at this stage shows the most rain, 2 to 3 inches occurring in the
Olympics and Cascades, with locally higher amounts up to 5 or 6
inches in the north Cascades.
