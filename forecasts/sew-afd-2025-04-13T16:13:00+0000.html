Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
913 AM PDT Sun Apr 13 2025

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A chilly start to the morning across Western Washington.
Temperatures are gradually warming up this morning(currently in
the upper 30s and low 40s as of 9 AM) and the Frost Advisory has
expired. Plenty of sunshine is expected today (locations near the
north coast may see some partly cloudy skies). Otherwise, no
significant updates to the forecast this morning. Please refer to
an updated aviation section below.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...Abundant high pressure will build into western
Washington through nearly all of this week with a couple of ridges
moving through the region. The coolest day of the week with be
this morning, as clear skies and cold air from Canada will lead to
frost in valley and rural areas away from water. Otherwise, high
temperatures will improve up to the upper 50s to low 60s. A couple
areas may hit 70 this week as well. Sky coverage will range from a
mix of clouds and sun to clear skies this week.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Yesterday`s trough has moved
out of the region this morning (and is currently centered over
western MT/Alberta). Already a ridge sits up the Pacific coast
with the axis along the Yukon/AK borderline. An associated jet max
between the ridge/trough has accelerated some cooler Canadian air
into the region this morning.

Sunday will be a near crystal-clear day (minus a few clouds in
spots, particularly the coast). This will help high temperatures
recover substantially - lowlands should see highs in the upper 50s
to low 60s today (warmest temps towards Chehalis). Lows
tonight/Monday morning will be a bit warmer (upper 30s to low 40s
in the lowlands with the loss of the jet). Monday will see highs
climb from the low 60s in the Bellingham area, to 70 in Centralia
(there will be a few more clouds to the north compared to the
south). On Tuesday there will be a small trough bypassing western
WA to the north in Canada. This will drop temperatures a few
degrees Tuesday to the low and mid 60s. Winds will remain light
out of the north or calm.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...The ensembles push the
middle of the week trough out of the coverage area to the east
(eastern WA down through ID/NV). This pretty much dried out all
PoPs in the forecast midweek (exception being a slight chance of
showers in the far north Cascades Wednesday). Wednesday will be
slightly cooler with highs in the upper 50s to low 60s across the
lowlands. Once the trough moves out of the region, another ridge
is expected to build and tilt westward through much of Canada.
Once again temperatures will warm up into Thursday/Friday by a few
degrees each day. There is a split in the models next weekend as
to if we`ll see a trough or keep the ridging going (but for now
have a slight chance of showers next Saturday night/Sunday).

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridging moving over the region will
promote northerly flow aloft through the TAF period. Widespread
VFR conditions at all area terminals this morning with clearing
skies and light winds. Northerly surface winds will persist for
the majority of the TAF sites and will increase towards 7-12 kt
for the afternoon and evening hours.

KSEA...VFR conditions expected through the TAF period. Light
northerly winds this morning will increase this afternoon and
evening towards 7-12 kts.

33/14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...High pressure will persist over the coastal waters
today. A thermal trough will then build northward along the
Washington coast tonight into Monday, allowing for flow to turn
briefly offshore on Monday. A weakening front will approach the
area waters on Monday afternoon and evening, but does not look to
have much impact to the area waters at this time. High pressure
will build back into the northeastern Pacific as the front dissipates
and will remain situated through midweek. N/NW winds across the
coastal waters will increase as a result Tuesday and Wednesday and
could result in additional small craft headlines at times.

Combined seas over the coastal waters will range between 4-6 ft
today into Monday. Seas will start to build towards 10-13 ft
Tuesday, with seas for the outermost coastal waters likely
building towards 14 ft. Seas then look to gradually subside
throughout the day Wednesday and look to subside back towards
4-6 ft again by Thursday.
