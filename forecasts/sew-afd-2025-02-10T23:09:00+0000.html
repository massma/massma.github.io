Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
309 PM PST Mon Feb 10 2025

.SYNOPSIS... <span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The dry and cool pattern will continue through
Wednesday with record low temperatures possible the next couple of
mornings. Precipitation associated with a system passing well to
the south of the area could reach as far north as the Puget Sound
area Thursday afternoon into Friday - falling as snow with cold
temperatures still in place. A Pacific frontal system over the
weekend will bring warmer and wetter weather to the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery showing
a lingering middle level cloud deck from western King County
extending south and westward to the coast as a weak upper level
circulation exits the region. This has produced a few light snow
flurries in a few spots this afternoon. Mostly clear skies for
the remainder of the area with breezy northerly winds. Dry and
cold northerly flow aloft tonight coupled with the low level
outflow will result in a clear, cold night. Temperatures will drop
to near record levels the next two mornings - reaching down into
mid teens to mid 20s. Weak Fraser River outflow winds will
continue over Whatcom County into the San Juans tonight, easing
overnight into Tuesday. Even with plenty of sunshine Tuesday and
Wednesday, highs will struggle reach near 40.

The large scale pattern will begin to transition Wednesday as an
upper level trough sliding along the 45th parallel begins to nudge
the upper level ridge over the Eastern Pacific. This system is
expected to primarily move into Northern California and
Oregon Thursday - it will bring some chance of precipitation
spreading northward into Western Washington from the south -
Thursday afternoon overnight into Friday morning. With the very
persistent cold air mass in place, this precipitation would be
expected to fall as a rain/snow mix Thursday afternoon and snow
Thursday night. NBM 24 hour snow probabilities are showing a
20-30% chance of light accumulations - less than 1 in - as far
north as Everett through Thursday night, and around 15% chance of
1 or more inches Olympia southward. How far northward the
precipitation will reach into Western Washington remains generally
uncertain, as well as the timing, the signal now in the ensembles
is for higher odds at very limited accumulations where there is
snow.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Temperatures into Friday
morning will remain cold enough for snow, but with temperatures
beginning to moderate any lingering showers should transition to
a rain snow mix by Friday afternoon.

What is left of the system should move well to the south and
east Friday night. The grand ensemble suite continues to highlight
the large scale pattern continuing to shift with a Pacific frontal
system moving into the region during the weekend. This will result
in a much warmer air mass, rising snow levels and much wetter
conditions through the weekend. Snow levels should rise to the
lower pass levels by late in the weekend. Highs will remain below
normal - but significantly warmer than they have been for some
time - rising into the mid 40s both Saturday and Sunday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak upper trough axis will continue to move southward
across the area this afternoon with northerly flow aloft settling in
tonight. The flow aloft becomes northerly tonight. VFR this
afternoon at the terminals with mid clouds in place. Skies will
clear out tonight, with patchy freezing fog favored to develop
mainly south of the Puget Sound overnight. Outside of breezy
northerly Fraser River outflow winds near KBLI, surface winds
generally N to E 5 to 12 kt this afternoon, decreasing to 4 to 8 kt
overnight.

KSEA...VFR ceilings with mid-level cloud deck scattering out by the
late afternoon. Surface winds light N/NE 9 to 12 knots through this
evening and easing to 5 to 8 kts overnight.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Fraser River outflow winds will continue over the Northern
Inland waters through this evening, reaching low end SCA criteria
through this evening. An approaching surface trough over the Oregon
offshore waters will turn the flow increasingly offshore toward
midweek followed by a return of more active weather by the end of
the week, bringing in increased winds across area waters heading
into the weekend.

Combined seas will stay between 4 to 7 feet through midweek before
building to 10 to 12 feet by late Thursday into Friday. Seas will
calm to 7 to 9 feet over the weekend, with potential for seas to
rise as high as 10 to 13 feet by early next week.
