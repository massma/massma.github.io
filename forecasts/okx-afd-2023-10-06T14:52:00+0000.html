Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
1052 AM EDT Fri Oct 6 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure offshore continues to shift east today as a
frontal system slowly approaches from the west. This frontal
system will drag a cold front through the area Saturday into
Saturday night while TC Philippe tracks north, about 250 to 300
nm east of Montauk Point on Saturday. The post tropical low
pressure tracks into northern New England and southeastern
Canada Saturday night. The low then tracks through southern
Canada early next week allowing weak disturbances to move
through the area during the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No significant changes with this update.

High pressure is currently offshore, well to our north and east,
and will continue to head east today.

Strong shortwave energy digs into the Upper Mississippi Valley,
around a southern Ontario closed low and deep eastern Central US
trough, while a broad upper low off the SE US coast gradually lifts
north, influencing TC Philippe to accelerate north towards Bermuda.
At the surface, a frontal system associated with the Ontario Low
pushes into the eastern Great Lakes.

Refer to the National Hurricane Center, https:/www.nhc.noaa.gov
for official forecasts on Philippe.

Scattered showers will be possible through the day with the
approach of lead and southern shortwave energy aiding lift of
the gradually increasing Atlantic and sub-tropical moisture
feed. The heaviest of the shower activity likely stays to the
north and west of the area through the day today with
orographics and in vicinity of weak warm front/pre-frontal
trough. Right now light returns can be seen over northeast NJ
and NYC and also approaching the south fork of Long Island. Have
adjusted PoPs to reflect this in the latest update.

Temperatures will be back to normal today, with highs in the low
70s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH SUNDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>As the upper level trough approaches, it will become negatively
tilted late tonight into early Saturday. Overall confidence
remains low due to the amount of interactions between features,
but the thinking remains the same that there will likely be a
focus for a 6 hour period of moderate to heavy rainfall late
tonight into Saturday. This will be forced by the negatively
tilted trough, and right rear quad of an upper level jet in a
moist airmass with pwats 1.5 - 1.75 inches. These values are
well above the 90% moving average for the OKX 12z 10/7 launch
per SPC`s Sounding Climatology Page.

NBM probabilities for 1 inch of rain over any 6 hr period tonight
continue to be about 5-10%, with the higher values over the Lower
Hudson Valley and southwester CT. The HREF also continues to show a
10% area over the western half of the area for 3 inches in 3 hours
in both the 3 hour periods ending 12z and 15z Saturday. These trends
need to continue to be monitored over the next 12+ hours. Bumped up
totals overall with this update and now have mainly 1.25 - 1.5 for
the Lower Hudson Valley, northeast NJ, NYC and portions of southern
CT.

The aforementioned Ontario low will drag a cold front through the
area late Saturday into Saturday night. Behind the front, showers
taper off and the coldest airmass of the season will filter in.
Gusty northwest winds will peak early Sunday morning with 15-20mph
sustained winds and 25-30mph gusts. Lows Saturday night will be in
the mid 40s to low 50s and highs on Sunday will only reach the upper
50s to low 60s.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...
High amplitude trough in association with strong low pressure over
northern New England Sunday will track into southeastern Canada and
retrograde into southern Ontario, north of the Great Lakes by Monday
night. This upper trough will remain over the Northeast and
upper Mid-West through much of next week, with some
weakening/deamplification as the low becomes vertically stacked
and weakens over Ontario. During this time frame, weak
disturbances in association with the cyclonic flow aloft will
move through the region. Where and when is still somewhat
uncertain at this point, but best timing right now look to be
Monday night through Tuesday night. However, it will not be
raining the entire time, with at most about a 30% chance of
showers during this time frame.

As far as temperature is concerned, a cooler air mass will be
advected into the region for much of the week. Temperatures on
Sunday and Monday will only be in the upper 50s to lower 60s. Some
moderation is expected by Tuesday onward as temperature are forecast
to rise into the lower to upper 60s.

&&

.AVIATION /15Z FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure centered well east of the area will gradually
retreat farther offshore today while a frontal system
approaches from the west.

IFR/LIFR conditions continue through mid morning. Vsbys have
improved for eastern terminals and expect that to continue for
western terminals as back edge of fog seen on satellite tracks
westward. Occasional VLIFR with vsbys 1/4 mile or less through,
mainly affecting KHPN through 16Z.

Cigs are expected to improve to MVFR by later this morning into
the early afternoon. Timing of this improvement is uncertain,
but along with improvement in vsbys, cigs look to be improving
over eastern areas (as per satellite imagery), though most
eastern terminals are still reporting IFR cigs in these
locations. However, KGON has just recently reported VFR cigs, so
will monitor for the potential for VFR conditions developing
later this morning for these areas.

Scattered showers and/or areas of drizzle remain possible
through much of the day, becoming increasingly likely into the
evening. Conditions expected to improve a bit to MVFR for most
places by 15Z and remain steady MVFR through the day. Conditions
then expected to drop back down to IFR by 00Z Friday evening.
Showers become more likely tonight. Locally moderate to heavy
rain is possible into Saturday morning. Thunder is possible
toward 12Z Saturday, but not high enough confidence in
occurrence and placement to include in the TAFs at this time.

ESE-E winds around 10 kt today and into tonight. Wind shift to
SW then W expected Saturday toward 18Z.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Timing of improving flight categories could be off by a couple
of hours this morning.

OUTLOOK FOR 12Z SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...

Saturday: MVFR or lower in rain showers. Improving late with a cold
frontal passage and NW winds 10-15kt G20-25kt.

Sunday: VFR. W winds 15-20kt G25-30kt.

Monday: Mainly VFR. Chance of showers late. SW G15-20kt

Tuesday...Manly VFR. Chance of showers. S-SW G15-20kt.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The Dense fog advisory for the Long Island Sound and eastern
Long Island bays will be allowed to expire at 1100 AM EDT.

Ocean seas near the lower New York Harbor were running about a
foot higher than forecast, and were increased ti around 4 feet.

Sub SCA winds are expected to continue through Saturday
morning, but ocean seas build to 5 ft tonight as swells increase
from TC Phillipe. By Saturday night, ocean seas are expected to
be 9-10 ft. SCA winds likely behind a strong cold frontal
passage late Saturday, continuing into Sunday.

SCA conditions look to continue for Sunday and into the first
part of Sunday night on all waters, though winds and waves will
be diminishing starting late Sunday afternoon. Waves peak on
the ocean to 6 to 10 ft, while 4 to 6 ft are expected on the
central and eastern sound waters by Sunday afternoon. A strong
WSW to W flow is expected, with sustained winds of 20 to 30 kt
on all waters, and gusts 30 to 35 kt. Gales are possible on the
ocean for Sunday, so will continue to monitor for this
possibility.

By late Sunday night, only the ocean waters are expected to remain
in SCA as wave heights above 5 ft. From Monday through Tuesday, sub
SCA conditions are expected on all waters.

.HYDROLOGY...
A basin wide average of 1 1/4 to 1 1/2" is likely from NYC and
points N&W, tapering to 1/4 to 1/2" along the coast from today
thru Sat evening. 00z HREF is indicating a 10% probability of
3"/3hr early Saturday morning into Saturday afternoon in
vicinity of NYC/NJ metro, which does pose some concerns for
isolated flash flooding across NYC/NJ metro and the quick
reacting river basins across NE NJ, Lower Hud and SW CT due to
saturated soils and streamflows at 75th percentile or greater.
Some CAMs also indicating potential for some very localized
swaths of 1-2"/hr rainfall rates in this area, which supports a
localized flash flood threat from any training
downpours/embedded tstms. Higher probability appears to be for
minor urban and poor drainage and small river/stream flooding.

Given the low confidence in the forecast overall with multiple
features interacting, decided to hold off on a Flood Watch. If
high res guidance becomes more bullish on coverage/duration of
these enhanced rainfall rates aver the next 12 hrs, a watch may
be needed.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
Long period SE swells from Phillipe will build to 6 to 8 ft
tonight into Sat Night, presenting likelihood of additional
beach erosion/escarpment from an east to west sweep of 5 to 9 ft
breaking surf. Because water levels are not astronomically
high, the dune erosion threat during times of high tide is
isolated.
