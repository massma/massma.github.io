Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
932 AM PST Thu Dec 19 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A series of weak fronts will bring several rounds of
light precipitation through the rest of the week, paired with
breezy winds and warmer temperatures. A more active pattern will
develop this weekend and into next week, with an increased risk of
impactful weather during the holiday.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The current forecast
remains on track with no planned updates. 33

Previous discussion...Showers will continue to spread inland
early this morning as a warm front sweeps across western
Washington. Much of the region will see little more than a drizzle
this morning, with most of the measurable rain falling over the
Olympic Peninsula. The most notable feature of this warm frontal
passage will be breezy winds, where gusts along the coast could
reach 35 to 40 mph into the early afternoon. A trailing cold front
will move inland later this afternoon, bringing in a heavier band
of precipitation with snow levels well above pass level. Rainfall
totals throughout the day will be light, with up to a tenth or
two for the interior lowlands, and up to a half of an inch to an
inch over the Olympic Peninsula and North Cascades. Temperatures
will peak several degrees above normal, in the mid 50s across the
lowlands.

Friday is on track to be the driest day of the period, though a
chance of showers is maintained in the forecast mainly over higher
terrain. Weak high pressure will build overhead late Thursday into
Friday morning, with another weak warm front and trailing cold
front on track to bring another round of breezy winds and light
rainfall to western Washington throughout the day Friday. Forecast
models show this system grazing the Olympic Peninsula, with up to
a tenth or two throughout the day and little more than a trace
elsewhere. Southerly flow aloft will maintain warm temperatures
with a degree or two of warming, allowing for another day in the
mid 50s for the lowlands.

Saturday will provide a similar story, though this system will be
slightly stronger. A wave of more widespread rainfall and breezy
winds will move northward across western Washington Saturday
afternoon as a trough lifts across the region. Snow levels will
drop to 3500-4000 ft by Saturday evening, though any snow
accumulations through the Cascade passes will be minimal. Rainfall
amounts will increase with this system, with up to half an inch
for most areas and up to an inch or more over the Olympic
Mountains. This storm system also has higher potential to bring
another round of gusty winds to the region, and the potential for
strong winds particularly along the coast continues to be
monitored for Saturday. The additional rainfall through Saturday
will also maintain elevated river flows across the region, but
river flooding is expected to be limited to the Skokomish River.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Active weather will
continue into the extended forecast period, with each subsequent
system growing in strength and bringing cascading impacts to the
region. Ensembles continue to show potential for rounds of strong
winds and periods of moderate to heavy rainfall Sunday and beyond,
with periods of accumulating mountain snow through the Cascade
passes Tuesday and beyond. These additional storm systems will
gradually increase in strength, increasing the risk of river
flooding and landslide. Long range models also continue to show
potential for hazardous weather conditions that may impact travel
mid-week and beyond, depending on how the forecast trends as
things get closer.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A quick upper level ridge has shifted inland this
morning. This will be followed by a shortwave trough pushing
northeast towards the Washington Coast today (creating southwest
flow aloft). Rain showers will continue on and off this
afternoon resulting in a mix of MVFR/VFR conditions across the
area, with lower conditions in heavier showers.

S/SE winds will have a few gusts up to of 25 to 30 kt expected at
terminals along the coast (and in the Northwest Interior).
Elsewhere, winds will likely remain around 5 to 10 knots within
the interior terminals.

KSEA...VFR conditions this morning. Spotty showers are possible
between 17Z-21Z. A more organized area of precipitation will
arrive after 22Z thus afternoon, and move out by 03Z Friday.
Convection is not expected. Ceilings will remain VFR trough the
day today, with a drop to MVFR generally expected after 03Z this
evening through 15Z Friday. Winds will remain out of the south at
or below 06 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Western Washington early this morning sits in between two
surface lows, with brief high pressure passing over us early this
morning with the next system already on short approach. The next
surface frontal system will produce areas of precipitation (expected
to be lighter overall compared to Wednesday). Gusty winds will also
pick back up later today into the afternoon. Confidence increased on
the probability of gales in the outer coastal waters (upgraded the
small craft to a gale warning). Another area of blustery south winds
exists in the East Strait of Juan de Fuca, Admiralty Inlet, and
the Northern Inland Waters. More systems are expected to impact
the region, beginning this weekend and continuing for a good chunk
of next week.

Seas will remain at or above 10 feet through the forecast, and will
approach at or above 20 feet late this weekend into next week.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Rivers will continue to recede this morning, with the
Skokomish River being the only river remaining in flood stage.
The Chehalis River at Grand Mound has crested below flood stage
early this morning and will continue to slowly recede. The Chehalis
River at Porter will likely follow close behind, cresting below
flood stage today.

Additional incoming precipitation later this week and into next
week will maintain the threat of river flooding across western
Washington, but models continue to show large discrepancies and
the forecast remains uncertain at this time. Ensembles show
potential for significant precipitation to return by mid to late
next week, which may cause elevated river flooding and landslide
concerns that may impact holiday travel.
