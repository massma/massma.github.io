Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
908 PM PDT Mon Sep 2 2024

.SYNOPSIS...An upper level trough will continue to push inland
across the Pacific Northwest tonight, bringing in chances for
isolated showers and thunderstorms. An upper level ridge will
follow suit on Tuesday, allowing a return to warm and dry
conditions. A slow cooling trend is expected for this weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Forecast remains on track
this evening with isolated lightning remaining generally southeast
and east of the Cascades this evening. Otherwise, widespread
stratus remains with areas of fog returning overnight. Light
drizzle remains possible with weak lift in the cloud layer and
sufficient moisture. Remainder of previous short/long term
sections follow below.

Temperatures across the region remain in the 60s. Temperature may
reach right around 70 later this afternoon, but not much warming
is expected today. Lows tonight in the 50s.

With the shortwave trough centered over Oregon ejecting eastward
tonight and ridging building back in beginning Tuesday, stratus
should clear out fairly quickly late tomorrow morning into
tomorrow afternoon. Highs will depend somewhat on how fast the
clouds clear out, but it will be slightly warmer with highs in the
low to mid 70s.

Temperatures will really begin to warm starting Wednesday as the
ridge becomes more centered over the area. A thermally induced
surface trough will build over the Washington coast, developing
light offshore flow. This will allow the airmass to warm and dry
out, with high temperatures Wednesday in the upper 70s to low 80s,
with mid to upper 80s possible in the Cascade and Olympic valleys.
Thursday looks to be the warmest day with the ridge axis directly
overhead. High temperatures rise into the mid 80s to low 90s, with
mid 90s possible in the Cascade valleys. There is quite a large
amount of model uncertainty regarding high temperatures along the
Pacific coast on Thursday, depending on the exact location of the
thermal trough and the timing of it moving inland and the flow
switching to onshore. The most likely solution allows highs to
rise into the low to mid 80s before onshore flow begins to cool
the coast, but if offshore flow is able to persist, temperatures
could be significantly warmer. This results in HeatRisk being
Moderate/Orange across almost the entire region, with some pockets
of Major/Red in the mountain valleys.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Friday will be another warm
day with the ridge beginning to depart and the thermal trough
moving eastward. Winds will be more solidly onshore which will
help the coast stay cool in the 70s. Elsewhere highs will be in
the 80s to low 90s in the Cascade valleys. Moderate/Orange
HeatRisk continues for Friday. Temperatures will begin a slow
cooling trend as the ridge continues to be pushed further east.
Ensembles are keying in on upper level troughing to develop just
offshore, which may set us up for the potential of slightly cooler
(though still slightly above average) temperatures and chances
for precipitation, but there remains discrepancies across the
ensembles on how far west the trough sets up and the evolution of
any shortwaves that progress through the trough.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest flow aloft and moderate onshore low-level
flow will continue across the region tonight. Shower and isolated
thunderstorm activity will still be possible through the evening
hours, but will primarily be confined to the Cascades and
especially to the southeast and east. Some slight lifting in
ceilings through around 06z remains possible in a few spots, but a
return of widespread MVFR and local IFR expected by 09z. Ceilings
look to scatter and return to VFR by the afternoon on Tuesday.

KSEA...Expect a return of lower ceilings around 1500 ft or so by
09z and remaining low through the morning push. Ceilings look to
improve back to VFR between 19-21Z Tuesday. Winds will from the
southwest around 6 to 8 kt.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...An onshore flow pattern will continue into Tuesday.
Westerly winds along the Strait of Juan de Fuca will increase
this evening, generally persisting between 10-20 kt. Latest
guidance does hint at some gusts to 25 kt, however gusts did not
look frequent or widespread enough for advisory issuance at this
time.

A thermally induced trough will extend northward along the coast
on Wednesday, allowing for flow to transition to offshore on
Wednesday and persist through Thursday. The trough will move
inland on Friday, allowing for high pressure over the northeastern
Pacific to build back into the coastal waters and for flow to
transition back to onshore.

Seas are generally hovering between 4-7 ft across the coastal
waters this afternoon. Seas will subside to 3-5 ft by midweek
before building to 5-7 ft again on Thursday and Friday.

.FIRE WEATHER...Onshore flow allowed for a return of cooler
and more moist air to Western Washington today. A few showers and
isolated thunderstorms moved across western Washington this morning.
While a possibility exists for a couple more storms this afternoon,
the chance has decreased with activity focused east of the Cascade
Crest. With drier fuels, the combination of lightning strikes and
low precipitation with these storms may be enough to start new
fires. Coverage of storms today is isolated in nature.

Warmer and drier conditions will return by mid week as upper level
ridging and surface troughing creates dry and unstable air over the
region. Mid Haines of 5`s and 6`s will result from high temperatures
in the upper 80s to low 90s Thursday, as well as light offshore
flow. The Thursday timeframe will be monitored for possible red flag
conditions, particularly over the Cascades.
