Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
336 AM PST Sat Dec 28 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An active weather pattern will continue across western
Washington over the weekend as a series of weather systems moves
across the area. A brief break in the pattern will be possible
late Monday into Tuesday, before additional systems move into the
region mid to late week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Overall, an active weather
pattern remains on tap throughout the short term. Radar shows
showers continuing to make their way across western Washington
early this morning as a frontal system progresses through the
region. It`s associated surface low remains situated just offshore
Vancouver Island and will push inland and weaken today. Snow
continues for the Cascades, where a Winter Weather Advisory
remains in effect through the afternoon and where additional snow
accumulations of 3 to 9 inches will be possible for the passes.
Snow levels will rise towards 4000 feet today, so expect snow to
mix and then change over to rain at Snoqualmie Pass later this
morning. Southerly winds have also started to pick up across
portions of the north interior overnight. Expect winds to increase
area-wide through the early morning hours and to remain breezy
into the afternoon. Wind gusts to 20 to 35 mph will be possible,
with a few localized gusts to 40 mph possible at times. Winds will
start to ease again through the late afternoon and evening hours.
For areas along the coast, expect seas to build towards 18 to 20
feet today. Large waves may run up further on area beaches and
localized erosion will be possible for coastal communities. Seas
will gradually begin to subside again by this evening.

Another frontal system will then lift northward into the area
on Sunday, bringing another round of lowland rain and mountain
snow to western Washington. Snow levels look to fall between
2500-3000 feet by Sunday night for another round of accumulating
snow at the passes. Latest HREF guidance suggest periods of heavy
mountain snow will be possible, with snow rates greater than 1
inch per hour, across portions of the southern and central Cascades
Sunday night into Monday. Isolated thunderstorms will also be
possible along the coast Sunday into Monday with cooling occuring
aloft. Lastly, the potential for minor coastal flooding will need to
continue to be monitored late this weekend into early next week
as the next round of perigean spring tides occurs.

Showers will then taper and become more confined to the mountains
through the day Monday, bringing a brief break in the unsettled
weather.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Expect the break in the
weather to continue into Tuesday as a transient upper ridge moves
over western Washington. This break will remain short-lived,
however, as the next system moves into the area midweek and brings
the next round of precipitation and breezy conditions to western
Washington. The warmer system will allow for snow levels to rise
to 5000-6000 feet and for temperatures to warm a couple degrees
above normal on Thursday. Currently, it looks as if the long term
will remain active, with yet another system expected to move into
the area on Friday. Unsettled weather then looks likely to persist
into next weekend. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Frontal activity has kept showers in the area into early
this morning. Another batch of showers is moving inland from the
coast per the radar trends this morning, which has been keeping area
terminals generally MVFR. As the back edge of precipitation moves
through Puget Sound, generally after 12Z, expect breezy conditions
to begin with gusts of between 25 to 30 kt throughout much of the
day today out of the southwest, tapering after 00Z. Some of the high-
res guidance is more excited over gusts lingering longer, but appear
to be outliers in the grander view. Area model soundings still show
unidirectional flow, limiting LLWS concerns. MVFR cigs persistent
throughout Puget Sound today, with MVFR to VFR oscillation along the
coast and Strait of Juan de Fuca.

KSEA...MVFR cigs at the terminal early this morning, with south to
southwest winds of 10 to 15 kt. Another round of precipitation is
approaching from the west, arriving likely around 12Z. This will
bring about some gusty conditions to the terminal ranging in speeds
from 20 to 25 kt through early afternoon. Showers and vicinity
showers through 00Z, becoming more scattered thereafter. Wind gusts
should also drop off after 00Z, but remain southerly.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Rain showers are expected to continue over all
waters tonight into Saturday (brief visibility reductions due to
mist are likely). Breezy southwest winds will today, and are
expected to peak at 20- 25 kt sustained, and 30 kt in gusts
(isolated gale gusts to 35 kt are possible). Behind the front, west
winds down the Strait of Juan de Fuca are expected. Small craft
advisories have been expanded to include all waters, and are timed
for when the most impactful winds will arrive between now and
Saturday evening. The advisory for the coastal waters will likely
continue into the whole weekend (due to seas increasing up to 18 to
22 feet Saturday, decreasing down to 8 to 10 feet Sunday into
Monday). As such, the small craft advisory for the coast has been
extended into Sunday, as well as the advisory for the west entrance
to the Strait of Juan de Fuca for heightened seas.

Going into next week, a weak system will pass through Sunday into
Monday. The only concern with this system is seas remaining at 8 to
10 feet (steeper seas in the outer coastal waters). A stronger
atmospheric river-style system middle of next week will likely bring
another round of gusty winds and increasing seas above 10 feet.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Several rounds of rainfall are expected over the next
week as a series of systems track across western Washington.
Currently, the Skokomish is the only river in flood and forecast
to remain in flood stage over the next few days. The Chehalis
river will continue to be closely monitored as it is forecast to
crest in action stage this weekend into early next week. A break
in the rain will allow for rivers to recede later Monday into
Tuesday before an active, wetter period begins again mid to late
week. Additional rainfall amounts of 2-4 inches over the Olympic
Peninsula may bring rises to Olympic area rivers once again by
late next week. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
