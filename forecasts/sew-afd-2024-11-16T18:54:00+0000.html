Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
1054 AM PST Sat Nov 16 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A strong storm system will enter approach the region
today bringing in widespread precipitation and breezy winds
until the system passes later Sunday. Unsettled conditions Sunday
night and Monday. Next system arriving Wednesday with
precipitation out ahead of the front reaching the area later
Tuesday. Wet conditions continuing through the end of next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Satellite imagery shows
cloudy skies over Western Washington early this morning. A bit of
clearing ahead of the clouds allowed fog to form over the
Southwest Interior, Lower Chehalis Valley and near the Hood
Canal. Visibilities less than a mile in some locations. The break
in the cloud cover also allowed temperatures to drop with most
places in the 30s at 3 am/11z.

Next system to reach the area poised offshore this morning. Rain
out ahead of the front will reach the coast later this morning
with rain spreading inland during the afternoon. The fog in parts
of the area this morning is shallow and with a little increase in
wind the fog will dissipate by noon. Snow levels starting out as
low as 1500 feet will rise to around 3000 feet by the end of the
afternoon. Precipitation not arriving until the afternoon in the
Cascades which will limit the amount of new snow in the passes.
Temperatures with the cloud cover and rain will only get into the
mid 40s.

Rain overnight as the front slowly moves closer to the coast and the
upper level trough behind the front digs south. Southwesterly
flow aloft ahead of the front will continue to pump warmer air
into the area with the snow levels rising up to 4500 feet in the
North Cascades and to near 7000 feet in the South Cascades. Winds
picking up overnight as the front inches closer with gusts in the
30 to 40 mph range for most areas by the early morning hours.
Temperatures will not drop much overnight. Lows in the lower to
mid 40s.

Front moving through Western Washington Sunday morning with a much
colder air mass moving in behind the front in the afternoon. This
will lower snow levels back down below all the passes, 3500 to
4000 feet, except Snoqualmie. Steady rain will give way to showers
in the afternoon. Post frontal 500 mb temperatures -30 to -35C
along the coast creating good lapse rates. Chance of afternoon
thunderstorms along the coast could get as far east as the
Olympics and Lower Chehalis Valley. Highs near 50.

Cool upper level trough hanging out over Western Washington Sunday
night and Monday. Nothing organized with the trough. Unstable air
mass over the area will keep showers in the forecast through the
period. Post frontal convergence zone near the East Entrance of
the Strait of Juan de Fuca extending east southeast into the
Cascades will enhance the shower activity and perhaps produce a
thunderstorm. Snow levels dropping Sunday night to 2000 to 2500
feet and to 1500 to 2000 feet Monday. Orographics are not very
strong with higher snow totals depending on the intensity of the
shower activity. Right now highest accumulations look to be near
Stevens Pass with the convergence zone.

Will keep the winter storm warning in the Cascades going but make
some adjustments to the elevations.

The combination of lower pressure from the front and a very high
tide cycle will keep coastal flooding going through the weekend during
high tide periods along the coast. Increasing potential for
coastal flooding in the interior waters this weekend. See
hydrology discussion for river flooding information.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Extended models having
trouble latching on to a solution for most of the latter half of
the week. Good agreement initially with operational models and
ensembles showing a possible atmospheric river Tuesday night into
Wednesday. The differences start showing up later Wednesday. The
operational solutions sag the atmospheric river into Oregon and
stall it south of Washington Wednesday night into Thursday leaving
at least the north part of the area dry. The operational runs
then lift the system back up over Western Washington Thursday
night into Friday. The ensembles are not in agreement with the
operational runs with almost all of the ensemble solutions
indicating precipitation over Western Washington Wednesday night
into Friday. There is better agreement that the deep layer of
moisture gets cut off a little beginning Wednesday night leading
to lower precipitation amounts Thursday and Friday. Models in a
little bit better agreement Saturday with what is left of the
atmospheric river still hanging around the area. Will have rain or
rain likely in every period through the extended forecast. Snow
levels could be as low as 4000 feet in the Central and Northern
Cascades bringing up the possibility of heavy snow in the higher
elevations. Felton

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest flow aloft today as a incoming system
approaches the area. VFR for most terminals this morning. High
clouds are moving overhead of the approaching system currently.
Ceilings will start to fall later today as rainfall spreads
throughout the region. Coastal terminals will fall first, by 18-20z
to MVFR/IFR, with interior terminals falling shortly afterwards.
Light surface winds this morning will start to gradually increase
from the S/SE, to around 8 to 12 knots this afternoon. Winds may be
gusty, especially around the coast (KHQM, KCLM) and northern
terminals (KPAE, KBLI) with gusts up to 20-25 kts.

KSEA...VFR this morning will turn to MVFR this afternoon as rain and
low clouds start to move through the terminal. MVFR will likely stay
in place throughout the TAF period, with a 20% chance of IFR
conditions generally through the afternoon. Visibilities may be
limited at times as heavier showers move over the terminal
throughout the day. Light southerly winds this morning will slowly
ramp up into the afternoon, around 5 to 10 knots.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A warm front is on track to cross the area waters this
afternoon. As this front passes over the waters, Gale Force
southerlies can be expected over the coastal waters, along with
the East Entrance of the Strait of Juan De Fuca, and Admiralty
Inlet. Elsewhere, small craft advisories have been issued for the
remaining waters through this evening. A trailing cold front will
sweep onshore early on Sunday, for likely additional small craft
advisories.

Weak surface ridging will build near the area waters Monday into
Monday night. Progressing into midweek, models have been showing
an intense sub 960-millibar surface low deepening over the
offshore waters Tuesday night. There is uncertainty regarding the
track and strength of this system, but ensembles are hinting at
the possibility of some large seas (20+) in our coastal water
zones. In addition, wind speeds over the coastal waters may reach
Storm Force criteria Tuesday evening. It is still far out, but we
will continue to monitor changes in the strength of this system.

.HYDROLOGY...Another round of widespread precipitation this
weekend as a front moves through the area Sunday. Precipitation
amounts from this morning through late Sunday afternoon in the
mountains ranging from 2 to 3.5 inches. In the lowlands 0.5 inches
to 1.25 inches. Snow levels will fluctuate quite rapidly, with
snow levels rising up to 4500-7000 feet tonight then back down to
2000-2500 feet Sunday night and a little lower Monday. Expect
rises on area rivers, with the largest rises again expected on the
rivers flowing off of the Olympics. With the precipitation spread
out over the weekend the only river forecasted to go above flood
stage is the Skokomish River in Mason county. The river is
forecast to reach flood stage Sunday morning.

A warmer air mass will arrive in the middle of the week. Some
model solutions are indicating an atmospheric river Wednesday
possibly hanging around into Saturday. Rivers will continue to be
monitored through the next week. Felton
