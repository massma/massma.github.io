Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
347 PM EST Wed Nov 22 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Deepening low pressure east of New England tonight will track
slowly northeast through Thanksgiving Day, while high pressure
builds in from the southwest. A cold front will then pass through
the area dry on Friday. High pressure builds over the region on
Saturday, sliding offshore by Sunday. A low pressure system then
impacts the area late Sunday into Monday as it passes just
offshore. High pressure gradually builds back in through mid
next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Multiple shortwaves one in the northern branch of the polar jet,
and the other in the southern branch, will phase well offshore
tonight, allowing for a rapidly deepening low east of New
England. At the same time, high pressure will begin to nose in
from the SW. This will allow for an increasing pressure gradient
and the potential for gusty NW winds before daybreak. There is
some uncertainty to how mixed the airmass will be with only weak
cold advection and neutral to anticyclonic flow. Closer to the
coast and the warmer marine waters, mixing will be enhanced
with gusts up to around 25 mph possible, but weaker inland. It
will also be mostly cloudy to start with some clearing behind
the shortwave trough later tonight. Lows tonight will range
from the upper 30s inland to the lower 40s at the coast. The
cloud cover and winds will keep it a bit above normal.

For Thanksgiving Day, NW winds at the start of the day will
gust to around 20 mph, but then gradually back off toward the
afternoon. Skies will be mostly sunny with daytime highs near
normal, ranging from the upper 40s inland, to the lower 50s at
the coast.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A broad upper vortex tracking across eastern Canada Thursday
night into Friday will send a dry cold frontal passage through
the region Friday late morning into the afternoon. NW winds may
gust up to 20 mph behind the front with highs only getting into
the upper 40s. This is slightly below normal. Morning lows
Friday will be in the lower to mid 30s, but closer to 40 for
the NYC metro.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The period begins on a cold note, with CAD behind a dry fropa
Friday as surface high pressure builds in from the west. Friday
night looks to be the first widespread freeze of the season,
including the NYC metro, with morning lows ranging from the
lower 20s to around 30. BUFKIT soundings prog 925 mb
temperatures as low as
-6C to -8C on Saturday, and most should struggle to climb out of the
30s in the afternoon, or about 10 degrees below normal for late
November.

High pressure builds overhead on Saturday, maintaining dry
conditions for the first half of the weekend. The high slides
offshore Saturday night ahead of a digging upper trough over the
Central US. As this trough swings east, surface low pressure spins
up off the Southeast coast and tracks north on Sunday, passing near
the 40N/70W benchmark Monday morning. This should bring a period of
precipitation beginning Sunday evening. With SE flow, and limited
cold air in place, this appears to be predominantly liquid event for
the local region. While a bit of wet snow is possible at the onset
in parts of the lower Hudson Valley, this looks to be brief, if it
occurs at all. NBM probabilities for measurable snow (0.1"+) are
mostly confined to Orange Co, but even here, remain under 20%.

Drying conditions late Monday as the low pulls off into the Canadian
Maritimes. Behind it, global guidance is in good agreement that a
deep longwave trough sets up over the Eastern US, with several days
of below normal temperatures likely. Despite the colder regime, dry
conditions look to persist into mid next week as high pressure
gradually builds back into the region. Generally followed the NBM
for this update, with subtle adjustment.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /21Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure will pass to the east this evening. High pressure
builds in from the west tonight as the low tracks along the New
England coast.

Widespread MVFR will generally prevail through the evening and
tonight. VFR expected to develop Thursday morning with VFR expected
for the remainder of the TAF period.

NW Winds 10-15 kt G20-25kt are expected to develop tonight and
continue into Thursday morning.  Wind Gusts diminish later in the
day.

 ...NY Metro(KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Amendments possible for changing flight categories and wind speed
magnitude and direction.

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY...

18z Thu: VFR. NW winds 10-15 kt with gusts around 20 kt
diminishing.

Fri-Sat: VFR.

Sun: VFR early, then a chance of MVFR in showers late.

Mon: Chance of showers early otherwise becoming VFR. NW gusts to
25 kt in the afternoon.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A tightening pressure gradient due to deepening low pressure
east of New England and high pressure nosing in from the SW will
bring marginal SCA conditions to some of the non-ocean waters
(except NY Harbor and Western LI Sound). For the ocean,
lingering high seas and gusts 25 to 30 kt will keep a SCA in
effect through the day Thursday. There is a chance some 5 ft
seas linger into Thursday evening, especially east of Moriches
Inlet.

Sub-advisory conditions expected on all waters Friday through
Sunday.

A period of SCA conditions appears possible early next week as low
pressure passes nearby. Increasing SE flow associated with this
system may allow gusts to exceed 25 kt on Monday, especially on the
ocean. Winds lower by Tuesday, though ocean seas potentially linger
at or above 5 ft into mid next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
