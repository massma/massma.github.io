.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge over the area will weaken and shift
west tonight and Thursday. Weak system moving down British
Columbia coast moving through Thursday night. Upper level ridge
strengthening offshore Friday will nose into British Columbia
through the weekend into Monday with dry northeasterly flow aloft.
The ridge will start to weaken Tuesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows high
clouds streaming over the area. Stratus spilling out of the Strait
of Georgia covering the San Juans and northern slopes of the
Olympics. The stratus is as far south as Port Ludlow at 3 am/11z.
Areas of freezing fog formed after midnight in the Southwest
Interior and South Puget Sound. Temperatures were in the mid 20s
to mid 30s.

Upper level ridge remaining in place over the area today with some
high clouds moving through the ridge. Stratus and freezing fog not
very deep and will dissipate by midday. Highs in the lower to mid
40s.

Ridge beginning to weaken tonight and retrograde westward as a
shortwave moves over the top of the ridge into Haida Gwaii around
12z Thursday. High clouds not thick enough to prevent some patchy
freezing fog in the usual places like the Southwest Interior. Lows
once again will be in the mid 20s to mid 30s.

Ridge continuing to retrograde Thursday opening the door for the
shortwave to move down the British Columbia coast towards Western
Washington. By 00z Friday system just to the north over Southern
British Columbia. Close enough for slight chance pops near the
Canadian border Thursday afternoon. Increasing clouds during the
afternoon for the remainder of the area. Highs in the lower to
mid 40s.

Shortwave moving through Thursday night. With the track mainly
over land combined with fighting its way through the backside of
the ridge there will not be a lot of juice left with this feature
as it reaches the area. Chance pops for most locations. Best
chance of precipitation over the North Cascades and even there
precipitation amounts looks to be a tenth of an inch or less.
Temperatures dropping to the lower and mid 30s before the cloud
cover thickens up enough to stop the temperatures from dropping.
Could see temps warm a couple of degrees overnight. Lows in the
lower to mid 30s.

Shortwave south of the area Friday morning with just chance pops
over the southern portion. Upper level ridge offshore gaining
amplitude with the flow aloft becoming northerly creating sunny
skies in the afternoon from about Tacoma northward. Highs once
again in the lower to mid 40s.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement, as they have been for the last few runs, with the upper
level ridge nosing into British Columbia through the weekend then
drifting south over Western Washington Monday and Tuesday. Upper
level low over Southern California/Nevada creating a rex block
pattern in the upper levels. If you liked the weather the last
couple of days you will like the weather in the extended since it
is going to be instant replay. Light surface gradients through the
period with patchy freezing fog forming in the morning in favored
locations like the Southwest Interior. The fog will not be deep
enough to last into the afternoon hours. Temperatures will
continue to be below normal with highs in the lower to mid 40s and
lows in the mid 20s to lower 30s.

Models are hinting at the pattern breaking down in the middle next
week with the possibility of an organized front arriving for the
end of the month. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow aloft as high pressure continues to
dominate over western Washington. VFR conditions at most area
terminals early this morning, with lower clouds hanging out over the
Strait of Juan de Fuca and Strait of Georgia near the Canadian
border. High cirrus has begun to spread over western Washington.
This should help limit widespread fog development across the area,
though some area terminals in the south Puget Sound area (including
PWT and OLM) have begun to experience some periods of freezing fog.
Cirrus should continue through this morning with little expansion of
the fog expected. VFR conditions are expected through the rest of
the day on Wednesday with just high clouds overhead.

Winds remain light to calm this morning. Light winds do look to pick
up a touch today, up to around 6 to 10 kt. Winds will be northerly
through the Puget Sound, turning northeasterly as they are pulled
through the gaps in the Strait of Juan de Fuca and around Grays
Harbor.

KSEA...VFR conditions with some high clouds overhead. Expect
conditions to remain like so through the TAF period. Calm winds
early this morning will become northerly, 6 to 10 kt, by 18-20Z
Wednesday. Winds will remain north/northeasterly but decrease to 5
kt and less by 03Z Thursday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will remain in place over the coastal waters
through Thursday, maintaining light offshore flow and generally
benign conditions. A weak front will move southward from British
Columbia across the area Thursday, increasing northerly winds
Thursday night into Friday. Small Craft Advisory strength winds
likely across the outer coastal waters. High pressure remains in
place offshore this weekend into early next week, keeping winds
northerly and conditions dry and calm. Additional high pressure over
interior B.C. will allow for weak Fraser outflow across the northern
interior waters Friday into Saturday.

Seas will remain around 4 to 6 ft through early Thursday. Seas will
then slowly build up to 8 to 12 feet across the coastal waters on
Friday then subsiding to 3 to 6 feet over the weekend.
