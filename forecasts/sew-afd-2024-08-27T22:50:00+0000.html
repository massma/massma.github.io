Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
350 PM PDT Tue Aug 27 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A trough will continue to move through the region
today with lingering showers and convergence zone activity through
the evening. High pressure will start to build on Wednesday,
leading to a warm and drying trend into the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Recent radar imagery shows
convergence zone activity still continuing mainly around the
King/Snohomish county line, with showers in and around the zone.
Thunderstorm activity have been observed this afternoon around
the Puget Sound Convergence Zone, with a few bouts of lightning
here and there. PSCZ activity will continue to steer southward
towards Pierce county into this evening, with again chances of
showers and possibility a lightning strike or two. Again, most of
the precipitation will be mainly in the Cascades, but cannot rule
out a couple of potential showers near the zone this evening. With
any thunderstorm that develops, lightning, small hail, and brief
heavy downpours are the primary hazards. Shower activity will
decrease throughout the remainder of the evening, along with any
thunderstorm threat. High temperatures this afternoon will top
out in the mid to upper 60s across the interior, and lower 60s
along the coastal regions.

Conditions will begin to dry out tonight as a high pressure begins
to build offshore with higher upper level heights. With residual
surface moisture and mostly clear skies by tonight, can likely see
some patchy fog across the region early Wednesday morning.

Warmer and drier conditions will prevail throughout the short
term as upper level ridging continues over western Washington.
Temperatures will warm into the low 70s by Wednesday, and into the
upper 70s and lower 80s Thursday and Friday. What a way to end
August!

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Ensemble guidance
continues to highlight the aforementioned upper level ridge
starting to break down by Sunday, with a weak trough sliding
northward near our region by the beginning of next week. There is
some uncertainty regarding the exact placement and intensity of
this feature, which may result in differences in temperatures and
precipitation chances. As of now, confidence is low in any
particular detail, but will continue to monitor the trends.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow continues across the region with an upper
trough moving east into Western Washington. With this continued
onshore flow, a few isolated thunderstorms or strong showers will
continue to track southeast in a weak Puget Sound Convergence Zone
as it fades out. Otherwise, mostly VFR conditions under scattered
mid level clouds. Some low clouds likely return tonight near the
coast and portions of the interior, especially in the more favored
locations.

KSEA...VFR conditions and generally south surface winds this
afternoon with a persistent PSCZ bringing a few strong showers
in/around the terminal area through the afternoon. Expect this to
begin to fade out and shift south by evening with a switch to
northerly surface winds after this slides through. Light southeast
winds return by 12z tonight with some scattered low clouds but
likely VFR conditions remaining. Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow continues in the wake of the cold front
that passed earlier. Winds have eased a bit over the coastal waters,
but seas remain steep (especially beyond about 20 nm from shore), so
have extended the advisory for the outer coastal waters through 11
PM. Meanwhile, west winds through the Strait of Juan de Fuca
continue this afternoon to 20-25 kt. Onshore flow will begin to
relax tonight into Wednesday as broad surface ridging rebuilds over
the offshore and coastal waters. Thermally induced low pressure will
then expand northward along the Oregon and Washington coast Thursday
through Saturday, turning the flow northerly. Winds are expected to
remain generally under advisory levels across area waters with the
exception of perhaps the southern outer coastal waters. Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
