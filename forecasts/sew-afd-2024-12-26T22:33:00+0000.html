.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The unsettled weather pattern continues through the
weekend. Another frontal system will slide northward Friday into
Saturday with additional lowland rain, mountain snow, and
localized breezy winds. Another system expected on Sunday.
Lingering showers Monday into early Tuesday, before a frontal
system the middle of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showers linger over the
Cascades and Olympics this afternoon with continued westerly
flow. There is also some sunshine, especially over central Puget
Sound. Winds continue to taper off this afternoon with a few
remaining gusts of 20 to 30 MPH, otherwise, winds will continue to
become lighter into tonight. The next system is already sliding
northward as seen on satellite offshore of the Oregon coast and
will spread precipitation northward tonight through Friday. A
secondary front will immediately follow Friday night into Saturday
for additional precipitation. During this period, mountain snow
will continue for the Cascades and Olympics. Snow levels will
initially be around 3000 feet before rising to 3500 to 4000 feet
Friday afternoon through Saturday. A Winter Weather Advisory has
been issued for the Cascades due to the additional snowfall later
tonight through Saturday. A rain/snow mix is expected at times
for Snoqualmie Pass, resulting in lower accumulations, mainly
ranging 2 to 6 inches. Heavier snowfall amounts for Stevens and
White Passes ranging 10 to 18 inches. In addition, southerly winds
will increase Friday night through Saturday, with wind gusts
ranging 20 to 35 MPH for most of the lowlands. NBM suggests the
probabilities of gusts greater than 45 MPH are approximately 10 to
30 percent along the coast and Everett northward. High surf
concerns continue due to elevated seas generally between 16 to 22
feet into early Friday.

Another frontal system will slide northward along the Oregon
coastline Sunday with additional precipitation moving northward
during the day. Another round of mountain snowfall later this
weekend, with potentially heavier mountain snow generally south of
I-90. Otherwise, temperatures will mainly be near normal into the
weekend.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Wet and unsettled weather is
expected to continue next week as a multiple systems are set to
impact the region. A weak system will move across Western Washington
on Monday bringing the chance of light precipitation. Ensemble model
solutions are hinting at a possible atmospheric river impacting the
PNW on New Year`s Day through Thursday, bringing the chance for
steadier rain and snow across the region. As of now, guidance is not
showing a strong signal for impactful winds/wind gusts.

High temperatures will generally be in the 40s, with a few spots
seeing temperatures in the low 50s by Thursday. Low temperatures
expected to be in the upper 30s and lower 40s throughout the week,
with a slight dip in temperatures on Tuesday down to the mid-30s in
some of the lowlands.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface low pressure system has pushed east of area
this afternoon. Flow aloft has turned westerly aloft behind this
morning`s cold/occluded front. Breezy conditions continue at the
surface, with southwest winds still gusting up to 25 to 30 kt this
afternoon. The highest winds this afternoon have been located in
South Puget Sound and the South Interior, as well as the Pacific
Coast and Strait of Juan de Fuca areas. Guidance has winds
decreasing to around or under 10 kt tonight. Another frontal system
Friday will turn the winds briefly offshore out of the northeast.
They will turn back to the south Friday afternoon (with a few gusts
to 20 kt possible).

Radar has a few post frontal showers continuing in the Olympics,
Cascades and North Interior this afternoon. These will remain
isolated in nature through the afternoon, and wind down into the
evening. Ceilings have improved to VFR for a majority of areas
(pockets of clear sky have opened up over Puget Sound). The next
frontal system Friday morning will light showers (best chance is for
terminals south of I-90). The trailing occluded front will produce
more showers Friday afternoon and evening. Ceilings Friday morning
will drop to MVFR across a majority of the region, and remain MVFR
through the day. Pockets of IFR are possible (especially in the
South Interior up to Kitsap Peninsula, and Cascades/Olympics).
Lower visibilities are possible due to mist and precipitation
falling.

KSEA...MVFR still holding on this afternoon (broken cloud deck at
1,500 is beginning to erode based on Satellite, so will go VFR later
this afternoon through the evening). Breezy south-southwest winds
continue (gusting up to 25-30 kt) - will wind down going into
Thursday evening to around 10 kt and drop to around 5 kt later
tonight. Quick turn to the northeast is expected from roughly 03Z-
18Z ahead of the warm front with rain showers early Friday morning.
Ceilings will drop tonight down to MVFR, and decrease to around
1,000-1,500 feet Friday afternoon. Some mist may mix in. Winds pick
up Friday afternoon out of the south at around 8-10 kt gusting to 20
kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Conditions are still active but much more benign compared
to what`s been observed previously. An occluded surface low that
brought gusty winds has now crossed well into BC. However, the next
disturbance is in line to approach the PNW coast as early as Friday
morning. Guidance has this feature barreling into the mouth of the
Columbia so the strongest winds should remain to our south. But, a
SCA will remain over the East Strait due to a quick shot of winds
overnight. SCAs will remain over the coastal waters, Grays Harbor
Bar, and West Strait due to high seas into the weekend. The pattern
will remain active through Monday as successive frontal system bring
the potential for more headlines.

An updated wave height forecast have seas this evening 15-18 ft
through Friday before ramping back to up to 18-22 ft towards
Saturday. A gradual fall to 10-13 ft Sunday-Monday before
finally settling below 10 ft by Tuesday.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Additional frontal systems will move across Western
Washington through Sunday, resulting in continued QPF. Although
the precipitation amounts will be less with these systems during
this period, the lack of a break will keep rivers over the
Southwest Interior rising this weekend. It remains possible that
the lower reaches of the Chehalis could flood Friday into the
weekend, although river forecasts have lowered slightly due to
QPF.

Rivers across the remainder of the area will also be on the rise
at times in the next few days but the combination of a less
precipitation and a little cooler temperatures in the Cascades
will keep the rivers flowing off the Cascades in their banks
through the weekend into early next week.

With all of the precipitation the landslide threat will continue
to increase into the weekend. JD/Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
