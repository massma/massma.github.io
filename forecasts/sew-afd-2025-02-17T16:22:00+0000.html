National Weather Service Seattle WA
822 AM PST Mon Feb 17 2025

.SYNOPSIS...A frontal system continues to push through Western
Washington this morning, bringing lowland rain and mountain snow.
The next organized system will arrive Tuesday night into
Wednesday, which will bring another round of lowland rain and
mountain snow. Wet and unsettled conditions are expected to
continue into the weekend.

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Precipitation will continue to scatter out this morning,
becoming more isolated in coverage later today. This also includes
snow in the Cascades (which will be tapering back as well). High
temperatures today will likely be a couple degrees cooler post

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Radar imagery shows
the a second round of widespread precipitation moving across
Western Washington early this morning.  Additional rainfall
amounts will range from 0.10-0.60 inches through Monday morning.
Another round of snowfall across the Cascades is expected to last
into the morning, expect an additional 4-8 inches of snow across
the passes. The heaviest snowfall is expected to occur between now
and Monday morning. As a result, a Winter Storm Warning remains
in effect through 10 AM today. Precipitation should start to
decrease in coverage and intensity into the afternoon/evening
hours. Any precipitation lingering around will be light.

Brief dry period during the the first half of Tuesday as an upper
level ridge will settle over the Pacific Northwest. However, the
ridge will quickly exit the region as a shortwave trough continues
to push east into Western Washington Tuesday night. Precipitation
is expected to continue into Wednesday as the shortwave continues
to move across the region. Snow levels on Wednesday morning will
be around 1500-2000 ft and will rise to around 3000 ft by
Wednesday night. There is uncertainty in exact snowfall
accumulations in the passes at this time. However, the NBM`s 10th
percentile shows around 1-3 inches, while the 90th percentile
shows 10-13 inches.

High temperatures will be in the upper 40s to low 50s. Low
temperatures will continue to increase through midweek to the low
to mid 40s.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Conditions will dry out
on Thursday as upper level ridging settles over Western
Washington. There is good agreement between long-range models that
the wet and unsettled weather pattern will continue into the
weekend. A shortwave trough will push through the region on Friday
night through Saturday morning, bringing another round of lowland
rain and mountain snow. Snow levels will be around 3500-3800 ft
on Friday morning and will rise above 4500 ft by Friday night.

The next system of concern is the shortwave that will move over
Western Washington during the weekend. Snow levels on Saturday
will increase above 5000 ft and rise above 6000 ft on Sunday.
Therefore, expect rain for the majority of Western Washington,
including the passes. Mountain snow will be limited to elevations
higher than 5000/6000 ft. There is a lot of uncertainty regarding
QPF with this system at this time. However, long-range models and
IVT analysis are hinting at a potential atmospheric river that
could bring significant precipitation to Western Washington.

Temperatures will continue to warm up into the weekend, with high
temperatures reaching the mid 50s and low temperatures in the mid
to upper 40s by Sunday.

.HYDROLOGY...A pair of frontal systems will move across Western
Washington this week bringing modest precipitation to the area.
Snow levels will remain in the 3000 to 4000 ft range into Friday.
Models continuing to show the potential for at atmospheric river
event this weekend with the atmospheric river possibly remaining
over the area into Monday. Widespread river rises will result if
this scenario plays out with the possibility of flooding along the
Skokomish River and other rivers flowing off the Olympics like
the Satsop and the Bogachiel. A longer duration atmospheric river
event would also put pressure on rivers flowing off the Cascades.
Until this weekend, no flooding is forecast. The Skokomish may
rise into action stage Tuesday or Wednesday. Felton
