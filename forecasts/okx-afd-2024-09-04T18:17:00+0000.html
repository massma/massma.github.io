Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
217 PM EDT Wed Sep 4 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure over the region slides offshore this afternoon and
remains northeast of the area through Thursday. The high then
drifts east Friday. A cold front will move through the area
sometime Saturday night into Sunday morning. High pressure then
slowly builds in thereafter.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
Prior adjustments have held firm. However, dewpoints have gone a
little lower in spots. Have adjusted accordingly. Otherwise, the
forecast remains on track.

High pressure remains over the region today, and slides off the
northeast coast late this afternoon. With a deep dry atmospheric
column sky conditions are expected to be clear. High
temperatures will be slightly below seasonal normals.

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH FRIDAY/...
The high will remain off the northeast coast through Thursday,
and then begin to drift eastward late Thursday night and Friday.
Temperatures tonight and Thursday will remain near 5 degrees
below seasonal normals.

Clouds will be increasing Thursday night as offshore low
pressure moves northward, reaching east of the Delmarva by
Friday morning. Also, low level temperature warm slightly. While
Thursday night`s lows, and Friday`s highs will be higher than
Wednesday`s and Thursday`s temperatures will still be slightly
below normal.

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
A longwave trough digs into the Great Lakes Friday night, with a
closed 500mb low forming this weekend. The low will be slow to
depart, with general troughing over the northeast through early next
week. An associated surface low will form and deepen well to our
northwest, but will send a cold front through the area sometime
Saturday night into Sunday morning. At the same time, strong low
pressure will pass well offshore. High pressure slowly builds in
thereafter, with the potential for a few surface troughs to move
through the area early next week.

The only chances of rain in the long term period will be ahead of
and along the cold front Saturday into Sunday. Due to the timing of
the frontal passage, the best chances of any heavier showers and
thunder looks to be to our west, but can not be completely ruled
out. Have kept slight chance of thunderstorms in the forecast. At
this time, any hydrologic impacts are expected to be minor and
north and west of NYC. See Hydrology section below.

High pressure that builds in thereafter will bring another dry
airmass to the region. Dewpoints drop on Sunday and should stay in
the 40s to low 50s for a few days. High temperatures will be 5 to 10
degrees below normal on Sunday and Monday and then right around
normal on Tuesday and Wednesday. Lows look to be back in the upper
40s and 50s Sunday night and Monday night.

.AVIATION /18Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>VFR with high pressure in control.

SE sea breeze about to make it to KLGA and is already in at the
other coastal and metro terminals. These winds should die down
tonight and then back E-NE overnight. SE sea breezes either side
of 10 kt expected by afternoon on Thu except at KLGA, which
should hang onto an ENE wind off Long Island Sound until mid to
late afternoon.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

High confidence on winds.

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY...

Thursday afternoon through Friday: VFR.

Friday night: MVFR cigs possible late at KGON, otherwise VFR.

Saturday: MVFR cigs possible in the afternoon. Showers with MVFR
or lower cond also possible mainly late day and at night. SE-S
winds G20kt possible in the afternoon.

Sunday and Monday: VFR.

forecasts, can be found at: https:/www.weather.gov/zny/n90<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...
High pressure over the region will result in a weak pressure
gradient over the area waters, keeping winds and gusts below
advisory levels. However, with an increasing E/SE swell through
Thursday ocean seas are expected to build up to 5 feet by late
Thursday and remain elevated into Friday. A SCA has been posted
for Thursday afternoon and Thursday night, and will likely be
extended into Friday. Five to 6 ft seas are anticipated through
early Sunday on the ocean waters as easterly winds of 10-15 kt
combine with a building ESE swell from offshore low pressure.
Conditions thereafter lower below SCA criteria as high pressure
builds in.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
The potential for convection, which would help maximize PWATs of
around 1.50 to 1.75 inches in the area, is low during the time a
cold front passes through the area sometime Saturday night into
Sunday morning. Flash flooding is therefore not anticipated during
this time, but there is still a chance of minor/poor drainage
flooding mainly north and west of NYC. No hydrologic impacts are
expected otherwise through the rest of the forecast period.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
The rip current threat for today and Thursday is expected to be
moderate. A 7-9 second period ESE swell builds from 2-3 ft to
4-5 ft during this time. With the increasing swells Thursday,
the rip current risk may increase to high during the afternoon.

&&

.OKX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CT...None.
NY...None.
NJ...None.
MARINE...Small Craft Advisory from 2 PM Thursday to 6 AM EDT Friday for
