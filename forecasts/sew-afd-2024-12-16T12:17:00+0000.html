Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A series of frontal systems will move across Western
Washington this week with a continued active weather pattern. A
front today will bring widespread rain for the lowlands this
morning and mountain snow. A stronger system Tuesday into
Wednesday will bring heavier precipitation, breezy winds, and
mountain snow. Warmer, and unsettled conditions, likely to
continue late week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A front continues to bring
precipitation to Western Washington early this morning. The
majority of the precipitation is expected to lift northwards into
British Columbia by the midday timeframe, although showers will
linger at times into the afternoon. Snow will continue over the
mountains during this period, with a Winter Weather Advisory
remaining in effect for the southern and central Cascades, the
accumulating snowfall mainly above 3000 feet. An atmospheric river
will then be focused on Western Washington Tuesday into Wednesday.
During this period, an associated warm front will lift northward
Tuesday before a cold front moves across the area on Wednesday.
More information on this system below:

Rainfall: Precipitation associated with the aforementioned warm
front will slide northward Tuesday morning, with steadier rainfall
for the lowlands in the afternoon and overnight. A cold front will
follow rather quickly Wednesday morning, allowing for continued
heavier rain at times. During this period, snow levels will rise
rather quickly, peaking around 7500 to 8000 feet Tuesday night.
Uncertainty exists on the exact QPF values, especially for the
Olympics and Cascades, which will impact the potential for any
river flooding. Refer to the .HYDROLOGY section below for more
information. With that said, the 50th percentile NBM (24 hour
period through 18z Wednesday) suggests widespread 1-2 inches of
QPF for Puget Sound, with amounts around 3 inches for the coast.
Widespread 3 to 5 inches of QPF expected for the North Cascades
and Olympics during this period as well, with near 8 inches of QPF
for the Olympics on the 90th percentile NBM, highlighting the
continued uncertainty in exact amounts.

Mountain Passes: Another impactful aspect to this system may be
the precipitation type for the Cascade Passes, particularly
Stevens and Snoqualmie Pass, Tuesday night into early Wednesday.
Accumulating snowfall is initially expected on Tuesday before
snow levels rise quickly Tuesday night. The primary concern is
Tuesday night for the Passes with continued easterly winds and
warming temperatures aloft. Model soundings at Pass level suggest
a freezing rain concern during this period, also observed at the
end of the 00z HREF later Tuesday. The exact details will need to
be fine tuned in regards to the timing and any potential ice
accumulation, but if you`re traveling over the Passes Tuesday into
Wednesday morning, continue to monitor the weather forecast.

Winds: Southerly winds will increase in the warm sector Tuesday
night before the frontal passage on Wednesday. NBM probabilities
generally range 30 to 60 percent for gusts greater than 45 MPH
during this period for the coast, as well as Everett northward
along the water. Probabilities elsewhere around Puget Sound are
generally 15 to 30 percent of reaching that threshold. Will have
to monitor for any wind headlines during this period, especially
for those aforementioned areas that are likely to be breezy with
the increased southerly winds.

Post-frontal showers may be around Wednesday afternoon, however a
brief dry period is expected Wednesday evening. Otherwise, highs
will slowly warm each day through midweek, with highs reaching the
low to mid 50s by Wednesday.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Ensembles are in agreement
that ridging will build into the Interior West Thursday into
Friday. However, Western Washington will remain on the western
fringe of the ridging, which may allow for frontal systems to
bring precipitation at times through Saturday. WPC Cluster
Analysis shows the ECMWF ensembles as a more drier solution
compared to the multi-model ensemble mean (GFS, CMC, ECMWF ens).
Have kept the NBM probabilities in the forecast, which shows the
higher probabilities for precipitation late week along the
Olympic Peninsula and northern Cascades. Troughing nears the area
offshore later in the weekend, resulting in another round of
increased precipitation for the area. Temperatures will be above
normal during this period, with NBM highs in the 50s. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Majority of terminals currently trending VFR as
rain has started to move into Western Washington. However conditions
are expected to trend towards as the rain becomes more widespread
across the terminals on Monday morning. Expect lower visibilities
and lower ceilings. Based on model guidance, it is possible
terminals near the Kitsap Peninsula may trend toward IFR (35%
chance). Rain coverage should cease on Monday afternoon allowing
ceilings to improve towards VFR for a few hours. Another chance of
rain is expected to move in Monday night into early Tuesday morning,
which will trend ceilings again down to MVFR across the terminals.

Southerly/southeasterly flow expected to dominate the TAF period.
Terminals along the coast will likely see gusty conditions with
gusts up to 25 kt.

KSEA...Light rain has started to move over the terminal. Expect
these conditions to continue into the morning hours. Currently VFR
conditions but they are expected to trend into MVFR with the rain.
Ceilings are expected to improve to VFR during the afternoon hours
on Monday as rain showers dissipate and are expected to last into
the late evening hours. Another storm system will bring rain and
bring down ceilings down to MVFR, where they will likely remain for
the remainder of the TAF period.

Current surface flow is northeasterly. However, southeasterly
conditions are expected to dominate most of the TAF period. There
will be a short time period (around 21Z Monday to 04Z Tuesday),
where will winds will shift east, around 5 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weather system has moved over Washington`s waters and
winds and the gale force warning has expired for the coastal waters
and winds are expected to remain below advisory criteria. However
seas will likely still remain above 10 ft. Hence a small craft
advisory will be in effect for the coastal waters, Grays Harbor,
and the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

Another weather system is expected to move over the coastal waters
on Tuesday into Wednesday bringing the chance for small craft
criteria winds and gale force winds. Model guidance hints at
possible gales in the outer coastal waters, east entrance of the
Strait, and Northern Inland Waters. Waves with this system will
range between 10-15 ft for the coastal waters.

Multiple systems are expected to move over the waters throughout the
week keeping waves above 10 ft and more winds falling under small
craft criteria. Model guidance does hint at another strong system
coming at the end of the week with waves potentially building above
20 ft and another round of gale force winds.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Area rivers will rise with additional precipitation
through Tuesday morning ahead of an incoming atmospheric river
event that will cause significant rises to area rivers. Latest
deterministic forecasts show incoming liquid amounts of 4 to 7
inches over the Olympic Peninsula between Tuesday and Wednesday,
with up to 5 inches over the Cascades. Snow levels will also be
elevated during this event, lifting as high as 7000-8000 ft
Tuesday night. The 90th percentile NBM shows potential for up to
8 inches of liquid over the Olympic Mountains mid-week (24 hour
period), which would contribute to a significant rise in rivers.
The exact details of this mid-week system remain uncertain, but at
this time the Skokomish River is forecast to enter Moderate Flood
Stage on Wednesday with multiple area rivers reaching Action
Stage.

Additional incoming precipitation towards the end of the week
maintains the threat of river flooding across western Washington,
but models continue to show large differences and the forecast is
uncertain.
