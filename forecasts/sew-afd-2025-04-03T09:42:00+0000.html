.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will build into the region through the
remainder of the week, allowing conditions to dry out and warm up.

weekend as troughing settles into the Pacific Northwest.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Latest radar imagery shows
light shower activity east of the Puget Sound and along the
Pacific Coast early this morning slowly tapering off as dry
northerly flow develops aloft. Temperatures will continue to lower
into the 30s this morning with areas of patchy frost possible
mainly south of the Puget Sound through Lewis County. As drier air
continues to move into the region throughout the day, sky cover
will clear by the afternoon with highs peaking today in the mid to
upper 50s.

High pressure will continue to amplify and shift inland into the
weekend, with high temperatures reaching the 60s across the
lowlands by Friday with plenty of sunshine across the interior.
Temperatures will follow a warming trend into Saturday, with areas
along the Cascade Foothills reaching highs in the lower 70s.
As the next storm system slowly approaches, cloud cover will
increase throughout the day Saturday but with plenty of sun breaks.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...The next chance for
widespread precipitation increases throughout the day Sunday as
high pressure moves eastward and a front moves inland across the
Pacific Northwest. Southwest flow will maintain mild temperatures
in the 60s across the lowlands with snow levels between 6000-7000
feet on Sunday. A cold front will push inland late Sunday into
Monday, maintaining widespread showers as temperatures cool and
snow levels lower. Moist westerly flow will continue through the
first half of next week, with periods of breezy winds, persistent
rainfall over the lowlands, and periods of accumulating mountain
snow.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Variable to southeasterly flow early this morning, with
largely MVFR to VFR cigs. The exception being PWT in IFR likely
through 12Z. Conditions will be monitored at CLM, HQM and OLM as
well as there is potential for reductions in cigs through the early
morning hours as well.  Expect a transition to north/northwest flow
early this afternoon between 5 and 7 kts across most terminals,
generally after 20Z. Cigs will remain VFR through the period as high
pressure settles into the region.

KSEA...MVFR and VFR conditions are present early this morning, with
light southerly flow at 4 to 5 kts. This will persist through much
of the morning hours before VFR cigs return for the rest of the TAF
period. A transition to northwesterly flow is likely after 20Z
today, with speeds in the 5 to 7 kt range through 23Z, increasing
slightly to 7 to 8 kts after 00Z. Speeds look to drop back to around
5 kts after 03Z.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure will continue to build offshore,
easing marine winds and seas through the rest of the week. Benign
conditions will continue through the weekend, before a frontal
system approaches the waters Sunday evening. Here, we will likely see
elevated winds and seas return to the coastal waters.

Combined seas 3 to 5 feet through the rest of the week and into the
weekend. Seas will start to gradually build upwards by Sunday
ranging from 9 to 12 feet.
