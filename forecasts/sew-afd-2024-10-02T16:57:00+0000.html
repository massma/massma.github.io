Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
957 AM PDT Wed Oct 2 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Weak system moving by to the north today. Upper level
ridge building tonight shifting east Thursday. Frontal system
arriving Friday bringing rain to the area. Upper level ridge rebuilding
Saturday into Sunday will weaken again Monday and Tuesday as
another weak system moves by mainly to the north.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Forecast remains on track
this morning with a few light showers through the day but
generally dry today.

Cloud cover decreasing a little over the southern portion of the
area while a weak shortwave moving by to the north will keep a
slight chance of showers near the Canadian border this afternoon.
Weak upper level trough over Western Washington this morning will
dissipate this afternoon. Cooler air aloft from the trough will
keep high temperatures in the upper 50s to mid 60s, slightly below
normal.

Upper level ridge building tonight with light surface gradients.
The combination of light flow in the lower levels and longer
nights this time of year will create some fog in the fog prone
areas like the Southwest Interior and interior river valleys early
Thursday morning. Lack of cloud cover will produce some cool low
temperatures with some locations in the Southwest Interior
dropping into the upper 30s. Lows in the 40s for the remainder of
the area.

Upper level ridge shifting east Thursday but next front still well
to the west making for a sunny day. The fog that does form will be
shallow and dissipate by late morning. Highs temperatures a few
degrees warmer than today, in the 60s.

Next front approaching the area Thursday night. Rain out ahead of
the front reaching the North Coast in the early morning hours.
Chance of rain for the rest of the area west of Puget Sound after
midnight. Increasing clouds will prevent the temperatures from
dropping as much as Thursday morning. Lows in the 40s.

Front moving through Western Washington later Friday. Rain out
ahead of the front moving into the area Friday morning. Parent low
associated with the front weakening as it moves into Central
British Columbia during the day. Even with the low well to the
north and weakening some gusty southerly winds over the area just
ahead and with the front Friday afternoon. Rain most of the day.
Highs near 60.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Extended models in pretty
good agreement this morning. Upper level ridge building in behind
the front Saturday with 500 mb heights near 580 dms by Saturday
afternoon. Ridge axis moving east Sunday with Western Washington
remaining on the backside of the ridge. Better agreement this
morning versus yesterday morning between the ensembles and the
operational runs with both GFS and ECMWF ensembles indicating dry
conditions for the weekend. Ridge weakening slightly with a
weakening front trying to reach the area later Monday into
Tuesday. Ensembles not impressed by the front with just a few (
less than 20 percent ) of the solutions indicating light
precipitation Monday night. More wet solutions in the ECMWF
ensembles Tuesday but not enough to raise the pops out of the
chance category. Highs in the 60s through the period with Sunday
and Monday slightly warmer than Saturday and Tuesday. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly/northwesterly flow aloft will continue, with
northerly offshore low level flow. Mostly all terminals are VFR
this morning, with a few lingering MVFR decks in the Puget Sound.
Expect remaining clouds to scatter out later this morning, to lead
to VFR everywhere for the remainder of the day.

KSEA...VFR this morning will continue through the TAF period.
Light NE winds this morning will take a more northerly component
around 18z-20z and remain around 4 to 8 kts.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Continue to observe hazardous seas behind a weak cold
front that went through the waters yesterday. Have observed wave
heights of 11 to 13 feet at 12 to 14 seconds at buoy 41 this
morning. With the current west/northwest swell, these waves are
expected to continue through Thursday morning.

Expect the flow to become more northerly Thursday as ridging
builds back in southern British Columbia. The next frontal system
will pass through Thursday/Friday. It appears at this time that
there may be gusty winds through the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
Otherwise predictability of hazards still remains relatively low
at this time.

Seas will drop gradually down to 4 to 6 feet Thursday/Friday,
building back to 5 to 7 feet towards the end of the week.
