.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The current forecast
remains on track with no planned updates this morning. 33

Previous discussion...Convergence zone over mostly Snohomish
county will begin dissipating later this morning. Weak shortwave
associated with the upper level low over Central British Columbia
slowly moving northeast of the North Cascades this morning. Both
of these features will produce isolated showers this morning. For
the remainder of the area mostly cloudy skies. Cloud cover
decreasing across the area this afternoon. With the cloud cover
and cooler temperatures aloft highs today will be a little below
normal, in the mid 60s to mid 70s.

Upper level trough east of the area tonight with a weaker trough
beginning to form offshore. Low level onshore flow will become
light. This will prevent the marine layer from getting much into
the interior. With the lack of cloud cover the cooler locations in
the interior will drop into the upper 40s overnight. Lows for the
remainder of the area in the lower to mid 50s.

Weak upper level trough developing over Western Washington late
Friday. Not much with this feature with mostly sunny skies for
all but the coast. Shallow marine layer bringing some low clouds
to the coast in the morning. The clouds will retreat offshore by
afternoon. Highs near normal with 70s and lower 80s interior and
mid 60s to lower 70s coast.

Weak trough remaining over Western Washington Friday night and
Saturday. Increasing onshore gradients Friday night will pull the
marine layer into the interior but at this point the onshore flow
does not look strong enough to get the marine layer east of Puget
Sound Saturday morning. The stratus will retreat to the coastline
by midday. Lows FRiday night mostly in the lower to mid 50s.
Highs Saturday in the 70s in the interior and mid to upper 60s
coast.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Extended models in pretty
good agreement with the weak upper level trough over the area
Sunday followed by a rare late July frontal system Monday into
early Tuesday. Main portion of the front moving into British
Columbia with Western Washington getting the southern end of the
front. With 500 mb heights in the mid to upper 570 dms plus
Western Washington on the southern end of the front plus the
climatology for this time of the year will keep pops in the chance
category for Monday and Tuesday. July 29th is the driest day of
the year in Seattle. In 79 years of records at seattle- Tacoma
airport it has only rained a total of 0.31 inches on July 29th (
0.17 inches in 1993, 0.11 in 2008, 0.02 in 1955 and 0.01 inches in
1981 ). Upper level trough axis moving through later Tuesday. Highs
in the mid 60s to mid 70s with lows mostly in the 50s.

Weak upper level ridge building Tuesday night and Wednesday for
dry and warmer weather. Lows Tuesday night in the mid 50s to lower
60s. Highs Wednesday near normal, 70s and lower 80s inland and mid
60s to lower 70s coast. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low will continue to fill as it moves
inland over southern British Columbia today. This will swing
around a jet max over the state with strong west flow aloft
(particularly at higher altitudes over 30,000 feet with 100 kt
winds). Winds aloft will be out of the west/northwest. Satellite
shows stratus has pushed into the interior this morning, with
conditions at area terminals primarily VFR to MVFR. Radar also
shows a few showers persisting across the North Cascades this
morning. Winds at the surface remain breezy in spots, mainly
across the northern interior terminals. Winds will ease and
persist out of the west at 8 to 12 kt (with gusts to 16-18 kt
periodic throughout the day) along the Strait. Remaining inland
areas will see southwest winds 6 to 10 kt (couple gusts to 15 kt
possible) turning northwest late this afternoon. Expect CIGs to
lift and gradually scatter late this morning and afternoon.

KSEA...MVFR cigs with stratus. Expect CIGs to lift and scatter
by 20Z for a return to VFR conditions. Winds southwest this
morning persisting at 4 to 8 kt, becoming northwest later this
afternoon at 6 to 10 kt (a gust or two to 15 kt possible).

.MARINE...A strong upper level low will fill moving inland this
morning. High pressure remains out in the east central Pacific Ocean
with ridging up to Alaska. This will continue onshore flow with west
winds in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and northwest winds in the
coastal waters. The associated jet max with the low has been able to
mix strong winds down to the Strait of Juan de Fuca (observed wind
gusts to 35 kt at Smith island this morning). With the push
gradually weakening this morning, the gale threat will end, but
there remains a strong chance (based on HREF ensemble guidance) for
frequent gusts to 25 kt in the Central/East Strait of Juan de Fuca
throughout the day. A small craft advisory will replace the gale
warning from 5 AM to 11 PM Thursday. Winds will drop off in the
advisory area late tonight.

The outer coastal waters may see northwest winds up to 20 kt and
gusts to 25 kt Friday evening/Saturday. Otherwise winds remain light
at 8 to 14 kt for remaining areas. Wave heights will hold at 3 to 6
feet through next week.
