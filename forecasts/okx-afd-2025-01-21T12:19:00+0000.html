Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
719 AM EST Tue Jan 21 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure will gradually build in from the west through
midweek. The high will move over the local region Wednesday
night and then offshore on Thursday. A low pressure system then
travels offshore Thursday night into early Friday. High pressure
returns thereafter into Saturday and then moves offshore
Saturday night into Sunday. Low pressure approaches Sunday night
into next Monday with an accompanying cold front moving across.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Forecast generally on track this morning with just some minor
adjustments to current temperatures. Otherwise, high pressure
over the region will keep conditions mostly dry through the near
term period. An upper level shortwave will pivot across the
region late Tuesday into Tuesday night. This will bring some
cloud cover to the region. Expect a mostly cloudy
afternoon/evening. As the shortwave exits the region, a few
light snow showers or flurries may be possible across far
eastern portion of the CWA. POPs will be limited to 20 percent.
Sky conditions will gradually clear from west to east,
especially towards midnight. This should set up another night of
decent radiational cooling. Winds will remain rather light,
especially north and west of NYC, where the coldest temperatures
of the night are expected. With respect to temperatures, expect
highs today to climb into the teens and lower 20s. Tonight lows
will fall into the single digits and teens. A few of the
normally colder spots may see temperatures fall below 0.

Just like Monday night, In terms of zone averages, wind chill values
are expected to remain short of cold weather advisory criteria,
which is -10 degrees F or lower for all but LI and the metro NYC,
where it is -5 degrees F or lower. Would not be surprised if one or
two isolated locations reach criteria, but at this time, we are not
expecting these conditions to warrant any headlines.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/...
High pressure will primarily dominate through the short term with
mostly dry and cold conditions. The arctic airmass will remain over
the region Wednesday highs only in the teens and lower 20s. However,
temperatures will start to moderate a bit on Thursday, as a more W-
SW flow develops. Highs on Thursday will be range from the middle
20s to lower 30s, with a few locations across Long Island possibly
getting back above freezing. Overnight lows both nights fall into
the single digits and teens, except NYC may see lows in the lower
20s Thursday night.

An area of low pressure passes offshore Thursday night. This is
expected to remain far enough offshore but some forecast models show
a closer approach, bringing a slight chance of snow along the
southeast coastal sections of the local region Thursday afternoon
into Thursday night. Once again, will limit POPs to slight chance to
account for this.

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
Main jet stream will remain south of the region and mid level
trough will remain over the Northeast Friday into Friday night.
The pattern shifts thereafter to more zonal aloft going into the
weekend. An upper level shortwave trough approaches next
Monday.

At the surface, low pressure approaches from the west next Monday
along with an accompanying cold front. There are differences between
forecast models in regards to timing and placement of the low
pressure and front. This will allow for a another slight chance of
snow as wet bulb cooling and thicknesses show more in the way of
snow. However, forecast models do not have much moisture associated
with the front, with some models keeping the area dry.

Moderating temperatures for Friday into the weekend, though they
will still be well below normal through the first half of the
weekend. Temperatures climb above freezing by Sunday for much, if
not all of the forecast area. Temperatures slowly cool for the
beginning of next week, but only to slightly below normal
levels.
