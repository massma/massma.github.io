Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
735 PM EDT Sat Oct 28 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front continues to move through the region this evening.
A wave of low pressure will ride along the front Sunday. Low
pressure impacting the region Monday moves northeast through
Monday night as high pressure builds in from the west. Another
low quickly follows Tuesday night through Wednesday, tracking
northward off the east coast. High pressure builds into the area
late Wednesday, and moves off shore toward the end of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SUNDAY MORNING/...
Made minor adjustments for the cloud cover, which has been
increasing ahead of a cold front, and temperatures and dew
points.

A weak cold front will move into the area through tonight
accompanied by an increase of clouds. Temperatures will cool off
quickly following the cold front passage tonight as high
pressure briefly builds down from Ontario. Temperatures are
expected to be in the 40s inland and 50s elsewhere.

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT/...
A steady rainfall expected for most of the day Sunday. The rain
could become moderate for a time during the late afternoon
mainly inland north/west of NYC, then may lessen in intensity to
a light rain or drizzle before picking up once again late
Sunday night as a surface wave approaches and moves across or
just south of the area.

Sunday`s high will remain cool, with highs in the upper 40s
inland and mid to upper 50s across the NYC metro/Long Island.
Lows Sunday night will be in the lower 40s inland and low to mid
50s across NYC metro/Long Island.

&&

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
A nearly full latitude longwave trough will be affecting the area
Monday through Wednesday night as the trough slowly translates
eastward from the Rocky Mountain states and off the coast Wednesday
night. The flow becomes nearly zonal with a weak shortwave tracking
through the flow Friday. Colder air will be moving in behind a
departing low Monday night, with temperatures near seasonal levels
Monday and Monday night. Temperatures will then be 5 to nearly 10
degrees below normal Tuesday and Tuesday night. Even colder air
moves into the region Wednesday and Wednesday night as another low
tracks off the eastern seaboard, and another high brings in colder
Canadian air. With the changeable temperatures remaining below
normal, blended the NBM and mostly CONSALL for temperatures
remaining below seasonal normals. Wednesday night, and again
Thursday night, temperatures are expected to be as much as 10
degrees below normal. A gradually warmup begins during the day
Thursday as high pressure south of the area drifts east and a return
flow develops. Temperatures return to normal levels by next weekend.

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
Astronomical tides will continue to increase into early next

Sunday morning for S Nassau and SW Fairfield where water levels
should be well into the minor category at the Freeport,
Reynolds Channel and Bridgeport gauges.

A statement was issued for Jamaica Bay where the Inwood gauges
may touch the minor threshold as well as S Westchester with the
