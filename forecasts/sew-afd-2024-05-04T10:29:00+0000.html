Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A return to cool and unsettled conditions will
continue across the Pacific Northwest this weekend, with little
change through early next week. A shift in the pattern is then
expected for the second half of next week as high pressure aloft
likely develops over the region. This will bring a return of drier
and much warmer conditions to the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Latest NWS radar imagery
reveals the steady precipitation has largely remained draped along
and south of a roughly Port Angeles to Mount Rainier line early
this morning. With the boundary making little significant
progress, still expect the progression of any rain north of
Seattle to be rather minimal through the morning today. Some light
rain likely expands inland and a little more north, but the focus
for the consistent precipitation will remain across the
southwestern portions of the local area. In fact areas of Whatcom
County near the border will likely remain mostly dry and also a
bit on the warmer side. The upper level trough slides east of the
region by early Sunday but remains close enough to continue to
spread some showers across the local area. More significantly, the
next cold upper trough induces stronger onshore flow as it
approaches, which will increase the rain coverage across the
region. With stronger orographic support, expect heavier rainfall
up in the mountains (and snow in the higher Cascades above 4000
ft or so) but some shadowing to keep rainfall totals in the
Seattle metro area notably lower. We stay locked in the active
pattern with the upper trough crossing the region into Monday. As
lapse rates steepen, will have the potential for some isolated
thunderstorms and stronger onshore flow will likely bring a
developing Puget Sound Convergence Zone.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The start of the long term
period likely remains unsettled and showery with the lingering
upper trough still over the region. Strong support in the ensemble
guidance for a pattern shift around midweek though, with high
confidence in an upper ridge taking shape over or near the region.
While still some subtle variations among the various clusters of
solutions, the general trend suggests this warmer and drier
weather will be with us for the second half of the week. Have
maintained temperatures in line with the NBM, with likely
temperatures in the mid to upper 70s across much of the lowlands
late in the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
