Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
312 AM PDT Thu Oct 17 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Shower activity will taper off throughout the morning
today, providing some relief to wet conditions before an
atmospheric river brings moderate to heavy rainfall to western
Washington over the weekend. Split flow will develop by early next
week, allowing conditions to dry out for a few days.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough axis
will continue to swing across western Washington this morning,
pushing shower activity southeastward and filtering cooler air
inland. Snow levels will continue to lower throughout the morning,
dropping as low as 3500 ft. With low temperatures hovering near
freezing at some of the higher Cascade mountain passes, some
passes including Stevens and Rainy Pass may see an inch or two of
snow accumulation on the roads through the morning. Precipitation
will taper off across the lowlands by noon, and higher terrain
showers will linger into the afternoon with several inches of snow
accumulation over the higher peaks of the Cascades and Olympics.
Drier air will surge inland with weak high pressure, allowing for
sun breaks this afternoon and mostly sunny skies along the coast.
Temperatures today will peak in the mid 50s across the lowlands.

Weak high pressure will continue to build inland overnight and
into Friday morning, providing brief relief from wet conditions
before an atmospheric river pattern develops over the region.

An atmospheric river will push into western Washington and
British Columbia mid-day Friday, bringing significant rainfall to
the region. While forecast models continue to highlight the bulk
of the moisture initially focused northward over British Columbia,
moderate to heavy rainfall is on track for the northern coast,
Olympics, and North Cascades on Friday. Rainfall over much of the
interior lowlands will be rain shadowed initially but will
continue to fill in across the region throughout the weekend as
the storm system slowly pivots to the south and exits the region
by late Sunday. Ensembles continue to show good agreement over
significant rainfall totals, with up to 3 to 6 inches currently
forecast over the Olympic Peninsula and North Cascades. The rest
of the Washington Cascades will likely see rainfall amounts up to
2 to 3 inches, with 1 to 2 inches across the lowlands. Higher
peaks of the Olympics and Cascades will also see a few additional
inches of snow accumulation over the weekend. Area rivers will
likely see sharp rises with this atmospheric river, though models
continue to keep river flows below action stage with limited
flooding impacts expected. Gusty winds will also accompany this
storm system, with gusts reaching 30 to 40 mph particularly along
the north coast and gusts of 20 to 30 mph elsewhere. Temperatures
will warm up several degrees as this system moves over the region,
peaking in the low 60s across the lowlands on Saturday and
Sunday.

.LONG TERM / MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...A front will cross the
region on Monday as a positively tilted trough pushes the
atmospheric river system eastward, maintaining light remnant
shower activity across western Washington. At the same time, a
cutoff low is forecast to develop offshore near California,
developing split flow aloft by Monday afternoon. This will allow
conditions to dry out early next week, providing relief from the
first atmospheric river event of the season. High pressure is
favored to develop aloft by mid- week, maintaining dry conditions
and mostly clear skies. Temperatures through the first half of
next week will peak below normal in the low to mid 50s across the
lowlands.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak system will dissipate over the waters this
morning. High pressure will build this afternoon then weaken
tonight. A warm front moving into the northern portion of the
waters Friday stalling into Saturday. The warm front will lift
north Sunday as the trailing cold front approaches the waters.
Cold front will move through the area waters Sunday night. High
pressure rebuilding over the coastal waters Monday.

Gale force winds with the warm front over the coastal waters as
well as the entrances to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Admiralty
Inlet and the Northern Inland waters FRiday afternoon into early

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The first atmospheric river of the fall season is on
track to bring periods of moderate to heavy rainfall to western
Washington over the weekend, which will cause sharp rises to area
rivers. Forecast models continue to show potential for 3 to 6
inches of rainfall over the Olympic Peninsula and North Cascades,
with 1 to 2 inches across the lowlands. Despite the significant
incoming rainfall, area rivers are not expected to rise into
action stage or reach minor flood thresholds, though river
conditions will continue to be monitored closely.
