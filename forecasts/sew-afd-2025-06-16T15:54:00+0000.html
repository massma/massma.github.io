.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level troughing will remain the dominant
influence across western Washington through much of the week as
an upper level low spins across the northeastern Pacific. This
system will push a few weak fronts into the area Tuesday and
Wednesday, bringing chances of showers to western Washington.
More notable chances of precipitation are expected Friday into
the weekend as the upper low pushes inland over the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level troughing
will continue to influence the region through the first half of
the week as an upper level low spins across the northeastern
Pacific.

An upper level shortwave will move across the region today, while
a weak front approaches at the surface, breaking up as it gets
closer to the coast. Overall, expect today to be a mostly dry day
across western Washington. Onshore flow will continue in the low
levels, with increased cloud cover expected this morning as the
shortwave makes its way across the area. Clouds will make way for
some sunshine this afternoon and afternoon high temperatures will
be in the upper 60s to low 70s across the interior. Highs along
the coast will be in the low 60s.

The next frontal system will approach the region on Tuesday,
bringing chances of showers mainly to the coast. Overall rainfall
amounts look to be light, with most coastal areas only expected
to see a couple hundredths of an inch of rain. Afternoon highs
will be similar to Monday`s, with temperatures topping out in the
upper 60s to mid 70s across the interior and low 60s along the
coast.

The frontal system will then push inland Tuesday night into
Wednesday, bringing chances of showers and cloudy skies to the
interior. The bulk of the moisture with this system remains
focused on the Olympic Peninsula and across the North Cascades,
where up to a quarter of an inch of rain is possible. Most lowland
locations will see lighter amounts of a few hundredths of an
inch. High temperatures on Wednesday will be a few degrees cooler,
with most spots likely only climbing into the 60s, though a few
may make it into the low 70s.


.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...A few post-
frontal showers may linger into Thursday, but expect Thursday to
be a drier day across western Washington as a whole. The most
notable precipitation of the week is likely Friday into Saturday
as the upper level low across the northeastern Pacific sinks
southward and moves inland over the area Friday night into
Saturday. Rainfall amounts across the lowlands at this time
generally look to range between a tenth of an inch to a quarter
of an inch. This cool system will bring snow levels down to
5000-6000 ft over the weekend and looks to bring light snow
accumulations to the tallest mountain peaks. Those with plans
for outdoor recreation in the mountains will want to make sure
to stay tuned to the forecast over the coming days. High
temperatures over the weekend will generally trend below normal
as a result, with highs only expected to be in the 60s. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High clouds continue to move across most of Western
Washington this morning. Low clouds at the coast bringing down
ceilings to MVFR, with improvement expected by 19Z today. VFR for
all terminals into the afternoon and evening hours. MVFR stratus
will form again on the coast tonight, with the potential to drop
down to IFR. The low stratus will move inland early Tuesday morning
and possibly get as far east as South Puget Sound by 12Z Tuesday
morning.

KSEA...High clouds at times today. Southwesterly surface flow around
5-8 kt. Winds will attempt to become northwesterly in the 21Z-0Z
timeframe, but most likely will end up in the 250-280 degree range
