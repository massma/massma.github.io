.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The upper level ridge that has been planted over
Western Washington the past few days will begin to move east,
being replaced with troughing and a weak frontal system bringing
rain showers primarily west of Puget Sound. A stronger front is
expected to bring more widespread precipitation this weekend, in
the form of snow in the mountains, and rain at lower elevations.
Breezy south winds are expected with this front Saturday morning.
Next week does not appear to be an all week washout, but there
will be continuing chances of showers at times with additional
frontal systems moving through.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The state of Washington
still remains centered under an upper level ridge this morning,
with an upper level trough just offshore. As a result of the
mostly clear skies during the day and night Wednesday and cool
temperatures down into the low and mid 30s, areas of dense fog
developed late Wednesday evening. The lowest visibilities are
currently in and west of Puget Sound (primarily affecting the
Kitsap Peninsula up through Hood Canal/Whidbey Island/Strait of
Juan de Fuca through San Juans to the Canadian border. There still
could be fog at times in the urban corridors east of the sound,
but light southerly winds have been able to break up the large
bands of fog in these areas. Will continue the dense fog advisory
for areas along the I-5 corridor and Puget Sound areas through 10
AM (though the fog may wrap up sooner). There may also be local
areas of freezing dense fog (due to the cool temperatures this
morning).

And now: back to our regularly scheduled program of frontal
systems and disturbances. The trough just offshore this morning
is driving a weak occluded front that will weaken coming towards
the shore. The only real chance of precipitation will be the
chance of showers along the Pacific Coast. Otherwise, remaining
areas will remain dry today with increased cloud cover moving in
ahead of the trough/front. The temperatures will also increase
beginning Thursday night/Friday morning; lows will be about 5
degrees warmer than Thursday morning, and highs will return into
the low 50s Friday.

A closed upper level low from Alaska will track towards the
region Friday into the weekend. The center of the low will likely
track through central British Columbia, with the polar jet being
pushed to the south. A stronger warm/cold front combo is expected
to bring more widespread precipitation into the region Friday
afternoon through the weekend. The initial warm front will produce
showers along the coast Friday morning. The wettest day appears
to be Saturday morning with the cold front moving through, with
decent QPF totals of around 2-3 inches in the Northern
Cascades/Olympics/Pacific Coast, and around half an inch to an
inch in lowland areas. The snow levels will increase to around
9,000 feet Friday into Saturday morning with the warm front, but
quickly fall back to 3,000 feet Saturday afternoon. The
deterministic snow amounts increased slightly for the passes
(around 6 inches at Snoqualmie and 9.5 inches at Stevens Pass),
but probabilistically the mean still supports below advisory
accumulations for the North Cascades. Definitely will be worth
checking conditions (if traveling through the North Cascades this
weekend).

Additionally, there will be a brief period of breezy south winds
late Saturday morning and afternoon with the cold frontal
passage of up to 30 mph (breeziest points will be on the Pacific
Coast, Northwest Interior, and the Cascade Foothills. Again, these
are expected to be below advisory thresholds at this time.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Expect the shower activity
from Saturday to continue into Sunday, beginning to taper by the
afternoon. The cool air aloft will help keep any precipitation
falling as snow in the Cascade Foothills and Olympics (above 3,000
feet). There may be enough cool air aloft to concern a slight
chance of thunder along the coast Sunday (but could definitely
change between now and Sunday). There will be a mix of clouds and
blue sky going into next week. Temperatures will cool slightly,
with highs in the mid 40s and lows in the mid and upper 30s. Off
and on showers will be possible Tuesday into Wednesday, with
ensembles showing the potential for heavier precipitation next
week Wednesday.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow will persist aloft today as an
upper level trough approaches the region. Flow aloft will
transition to northwesterly late tonight as the trough pushes
inland. At the surface, a weak front will approach the region
today and dissipate.

Latest satellite imagery shows fog still draped across portions
of the interior early this morning. Conditions at area terminals
are a mixed bag, with terminals LIFR/IFR in fog and VFR/MVFR under
clear skies. Confidence on where the fog will linger through the
morning is low as an increase in S/SE winds have allowed for
better mixing and have resulted in a clearing of fog for some
terminals across the central and south Sound. Fog may briefly move
back into the terminals early this morning should winds ease.
Increasing mid to high level clouds streaming inland ahead of the
front should start to help mitigate additional fog formation
through the early morning. Terminals currently in fog may have
IFR/LIFR conditions stick around through the morning hours, before
improving this afternoon. Light showers look to move inland for
coastal terminals this morning and interior terminals this
afternoon as the weak front dissipates over the area.

KSEA...SE winds persisting at 4-8 kts overnight have allowed for
better mixing and a clearing of fog at the terminal. Should winds
ease this morning, could see fog briefly make its way back into
the terminal - however confidence in this scenario remains low.
Increasing mid to high level clouds will move into the terminal
this morning. Outside of any morning fog making it back into the
terminal, expect conditions to be VFR through most of the day.
Light showers may move into the terminal between 20-22Z. Winds
will be out of the SE, persisting between 4-8 kts. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak front will approach the region today, dissipating
as it moves into the coastal waters. Although marginal, there
remains some potential for this system to bring wind gusts to 25
kt to portions of the coastal waters through this afternoon so
have issued a small craft advisory for the outer coastal zones
this morning.

A stronger frontal system will move into the region Friday into
Saturday and will bring more widespread advisory strength winds
to the coastal waters and portions of the inland waters, like the
eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Northern Inland Waters.
Gales will also be possible for portions of the northern coastal
water zones as this system approaches. These southerly winds will
allow for steep seas to develop across the coastal waters on
Friday. Winds will switch to westerly in the wake of the front on
Saturday and will remain breezy across the coastal waters and
along the Strait of Juan de Fuca into Sunday as a low pressure
system pushes inland over BC/WA. Seas will build towards 15-19 ft
across the coastal waters on Sunday as a larger wave group arrives
from the west. High pressure will then build back into the coastal
waters early next week, promoting lighter winds and gradually
subsiding seas. Additional disturbances look to approach the
coastal waters near midweek. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper ridge over western WA will slowly move
east today, allowing a weak trough to move through. This will
bring, at best, a few light showers. Another weather system Friday
into Saturday is forecast to bring heavier precipitation. In
addition, snow levels are expected to rise later Friday into early
Saturday to 7000 to 9000 feet. This, combined with rainfall, will
result in rises on rivers across western Washington. The amount
of precipitation expected remains quite uncertain with the upper
amount 3 to 5 inches in the mountains, but only 2 to 3 inches
might be more likely.

At this time, the Skokomish River is the main river of concern for
potential river flooding during this period, and even that would
take something more than the lower end of the precipitation range.
The heavier precipitation amounts could drive some rivers to close
to or over minor flood. Due to this and the higher snow levels
Friday into Saturday, other area rivers will need to be monitored
for flood potential as well.
