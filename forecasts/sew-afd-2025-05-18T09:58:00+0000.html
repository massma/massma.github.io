Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
258 AM PDT Sun May 18 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Periods of showers will continue over western
Washington through the remainder of the weekend into part of the
work week. Some snow showers may make it down to the passes Sunday
with the cold air aloft making it down to near 3000 feet. The week
will gradually dry and warm up progressing towards next weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weather pattern across
western WA continues to remain unsettled this weekend. Saturday`s
surface and upper level troughs currently sit in eastern WA this
morning. The radar has remained active with a descent convergence
zone continuing in King/southern Snohomish Counties. The track
remains virtually stationary, and there will likely be at least
some lingering showers continuing into a good chunk of Sunday.
Radar estimated hourly rain rates are 0.10-0.25 inches/hour (but
will trend downward as the convergence zone becomes lighter during
the day). There has been some good rainfall totals with the
system (any moisture is welcome to improve the drought
conditions). While flooding is not expected, plenty of urban roads
with poor drainage areas may see ponding into Sunday, so beware
(if driving). The thunder threat has also dropped quite a bit with
this activity through the rest of the weekend (less than 10%
chance - too low to include in the forecast).

Outside of the convergence zone, couple pockets of showers will
continue through Sunday morning. The more prominent areas seeing
the showers are northern Whatcom County up into Canada, and along
the coast. These areas will see showers clear going into Sunday
afternoon. For those in the Cascades, snow levels with this system
did drop to just above 3,000 feet. ANyone traveling through the
passes may see some snow showers mix down with the convergence
zone. Stevens would have the best chance of seeing up to a inch of
snow (if it sticks well), otherwise accumulations will generally
be above the passes. Highs for Sunday will struggle to hit 60 in
most lowland areas (mid and upper 50s), and 30s and 40s in the
mountains.

Another frontal system/trough will swing down through western WA
tonight/Monday morning. This is expected to bring an initial
widespread band of showers early Monday morning (commute might be
sloppy with up to a quarter of an inch of rain falling Monday
morning in the lowlands). Behind the front, there will be some
lingering showers throughout the day, and will have to keep an eye
on any post- frontal convergence zone development. The trough
will become more positively tilted back into B.C. going into
Tuesday, so this will likely keep the precipitation chances going
into Tuesday. The precip by that point will be mostly concentrated
in the north Cascades (snow levels will climb back to near 5,000
feet with 0.5-1 inch of QPF in the Monday night/Tuesday morning
time period).

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...The ensembles going into
the second half of the week/next weekend overall show a warming
trend (though a couple members have it staying cooler a couple
days longer through the weekend). The precipitation chances will
drop substantially going into Wednesday (just the mountains at
that point as the upper flow pattern zones out more). The next
good chance of showers will come from a possible disturbance
Friday into Saturday (but these appear light at this time).
Temperatures are also expected to increase (Saturday puts highs
near 70 in the lowlands, and if Sunday holds true to "Sun-Day",
could see some significant clearing and highs approach 80 during
the day in some low valley/south interior areas.
