Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
324 PM PDT Sun Aug 18 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong upper level low will continue to spin
offshore through today, continuing to provide an unstable
environment over our area, with another chance of
showers/thunderstorms. Widespread coverage is not expected, with
most of the activity expected the western side of our region.
Unsettled weather will continue through midweek, with more chances
of showers and thunderstorms later on in the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Recent radar imagery
shows a few convective showers moving through Grays Harbor
county into Mason County, moving northward. There are also some
thunderstorms developing in southern Lewis County also moving
northeastward. This will largely be in the trend through the
remainder of the afternoon, with showers and possible
thunderstorms developing south of our area (Lewis, Grays Harbor
county) moving north, towards the Olympic Peninsula and areas
adjacent. In any thunderstorm that does develop, the primary
impacts are gusty erratic winds, frequent lightning, and heavy
rain. Again, coverage from these storms will be less than what we
saw yesterday, mostly confined to the western portion of our CWA,
but cannot rule out a stray storms drifting into Puget Sound this
evening.

This activity will likely last through the early evening hours.
As we progress into the nighttime hours, mostly all activity will
diminish as diurnal heating gets shut off and instability values
plummet.

The upper level low offshore will continue to move northeast
offshore into Tuesday. As of now, dry conditions will start of
Monday with perhaps areas of clouds and fog, with temperatures in
the mid 70s. Chance of rain showers will uptick across the area
Monday night into Tuesday, most likely having to do with wrap
around moisture from the aforementioned upper level low.

Another upper level low will drop down from British Columbia on
Wednesday night, which could provide another round of showers and
scattered thunderstorms across the area. he track of this upper
low is still uncertain, along with the placement. But for now, the
highest probabilities of thunderstorms seem to be located in the
Olympics and the Cascades, with the potential (20-25%) for the
interior lowlands.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Ensembles continue to
highlight unsettled weather throughout the long term period. The
aforementioned upper level low will continue to track southward
through Friday, with a chance of showers/thunderstorms, primarily
Thursday and Friday. The ensembles are starting to show signals of
possibly a ridge building into Sunday, which could bring back the
warm and dry conditions to our region.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Focus for convection mainly over the coast and Olympic
peninsula this afternoon and early evening with thunderstorms
possible. There`s at least a 10 percent chance of thunderstorms in
the interior as well. Convection looks to wind down and diminish
by 03Z. Pockets of low clouds and IFR to LIFR conditions possible
overnight. Otherwise mainly dry on Monday except for showers
developing along the coast in the afternoon. 33

KSEA...Line of showers and thunderstorms over the Olympic
peninsula will shift east and weaken/dissipate over the interior
this evening. However, there`s at least a 10 percent chance of
thunder in the vicinity through 03z (low confidence). Winds S to
10 kt. Dry conditions expected on Monday. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure will remain offshore through Monday with
S/SE flow over the waters. The strongest winds are over the
Coastal Waters and a Small Craft Advisory is in effect. The low
will weaken offshore on Tuesday. A Pacific system will track down
the coast Wednesday night and Thursday. Onshore flow will prevail
into the weekend with high pressure offshore. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low will continue to remain in the
region into Monday. A disturbance has already triggered scattered
thunderstorms this afternoon from the Southwest Interior into the
Olympics. There is also a chance of thunderstorms in the North
Cascades later this evening. Rainfall amounts will be
significantly lower across the area, with the best chance of
wetting rain in the Olympics. With continued cool, cloudy, and
high humidity conditions well into the week, holdover fires may
only smolder for quite sometime until we get our next hot, dry, or
windy conditions.
