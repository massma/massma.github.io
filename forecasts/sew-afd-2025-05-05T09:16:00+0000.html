Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
216 AM PDT Mon May 5 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A upper level ridge will produce dry and warmer
conditions across Western Washington through Tuesday. A weak
frontal system will arrive midweek with cooler temperatures and a
chance of showers. Somewhat warmer and generally dry conditions
return late week before another front approaches the region over
the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Shortwave ridging
continues to build into the region today as the weekend system
departs into the Northern Rockies. This will bring us a pair of
progressively warmer and sunny days as thermally induced low
pressure expands northward from Oregon. It will be short-lived as
a frontal boundary arrives on Wednesday producing a return to
onshore flow with a few showers across the area and a relatively
steep drop in high temperatures from those that we`ll see on
Tuesday.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Broad upper troughing
remains poised to our northwest into Thursday for continued
onshore flow and temperatures back near, if not a little below,
normal for the first week of May. Upper ridging centered well to
our south expands northward somewhat on Friday in response to a
trough digging southward out around 140W. This is expected to
produce a modest warmup and dry conditions. The battle between the
offshore trough and ridging centered over the Intermountain West
lends a higher degree of uncertainty to the forecast as we arrive
at the upcoming weekend. The National Blend of Models 50th
percentile output currently suggests the ridge will be strong
enough for another mild and generally dry day on Saturday before a
weakening front brings cooler temperatures and a returning chance
of precip for the second half of the weekend. Model ensembles
show quite a spread on day 7 at this time - so watch this space
for likely changes in the days to come.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>North-northwesterly flow aloft continues across western
Washington this morning as an upper-ridge builds into the region.
VFR at all terminals presently and is expected throughout the TAF
period for all terminals. Expect northerly surface winds today at 7
to 10 kts, with more west-northwest winds along the coast at similar
speeds.

KSEA...VFR cigs to remain in place throughout the TAF period, with
north to northeasterly surface winds. Expect wind speeds of 4 to 6
kts through late morning, increasing to 8 to 11 kts throughout the

a surface high remains offshore. Seas between 5 and 6 feet will
continue until Wednesday when the next frontal system moves through
the region. Northerly winds expected in Puget Sound, with west-
northwest winds over the coastal waters today under clear skies.
