Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
326 AM PDT Thu Oct 31 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Unsettled weather will continue through the weekend as
an upper trough offshore slowly progresses across the Pacific
Northwest. Another frontal system is expected Monday into early
Tuesday for additional precipitation. Some ridging may bring drier
weather during the middle of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showers continue,
particularly offshore and across the Olympic Peninsula this
morning with troughing over the area and an upper low located
along the SW BC coastline. Precipitation will slowly become more
widespread later this afternoon into tonight as the system
offshore meanders towards the Pacific Northwest. In addition,
guidance has recently been developing a subtle area of low
pressure later tonight offshore of Oregon, and moving northeast
into WA/OR on Friday. This will help to continue to spread
widespread moisture into Western Washington Friday into Friday
night, and the track will need to be monitored for any localized,
breezy winds, although this is mainly expected south of the area.
The primary impact through Friday night will be continued mountain
snow, especially for the Cascades of Pierce and Lewis Counties.
Snow levels during this period are expected to mainly range 3500
to 4500 feet. Forecast snowfall amounts through Friday range from
15 to 25 inches for Paradise and 8 to 12 inches for White Pass.
Snow amounts for Rainy Pass through Friday are 4 to 8 inches.
Lesser amounts are expected for Stevens Pass of 3 to 6 inches,
with less than 2 inches of snow at Snoqualmie Pass. A Winter
Weather Advisory remains in place for the North Cascades, as well
as Cascades of Pierce and Lewis Counties. If you`re traveling,
make sure to continue to monitor the weather forecasts.

Along with mountain snow, there remains a slight chance for
thunderstorms along the coast and offshore waters through tonight,
though expected to be limited. In addition, given the track of the
system, SE winds will increase on Friday across the area, with
locally breezy winds around Admiralty Inlet and Strait of Juan de
Fuca, gusts generally 15 to 30 MPH in these areas.

The upper trough will slowly move across the Pacific Northwest
Saturday for continued showers at times, especially for the
Cascades. Temperatures remaining mostly steady through the week,
with highs in the low to mid 50s.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Unsettled weather is
expected to continue into Sunday with periodic showers, especially
in the Cascades due to increasing northwest flow aloft. Another
frontal system is expected to move across Western Washington
Monday into Monday night for additional lowland rain, mountain
snow, and breezy winds. Snow levels during this period are
forecast to range 4000 to 4500 feet. Ensembles then suggest
ridging nudges into the area later Tuesday into Wednesday, for
potentially drier conditions. Temperatures during this period
generally near to slightly below normal. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft as an upper-low meanders off the BC
coast. A mix of MVFR/VFR ceilings with scattered showers this
morning. Showers will transition to widespread rain in the afternoon-
evening along with VFR cigs becoming more prevalent. However, lower
ceilings (MVFR) may remain along the coast. Rain looks to remain
overnight into Friday morning as MVFR cigs become more widespread.

KSEA...VFR cigs throughout much of the day today. HREF Grand
Ensemble indicates a 10-20% chance of ceilings dropping below 3,000
ft this morning, increasing to 40-50% chance at times during the
afternoon under passing showers. MVFR ceilings will become more
likely overnight as showers transition to more steadier rainfall
around 04-06z Friday. SSE surface winds around 4 to 8 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface low currently off the coast of Haida Gwaii will
gradually fill and position west of Vancouver Island today. Hazards
that remain in effect include SCA for coastal waters, Grays Harbor
Bar and West Entrance due to hazardous seas. A SCA also exists for
the East Entrance. Here, winds may be below advisory threshold at
times through much of the morning but criteria will again be met
towards the second half of the day as southeasterly winds increase.
Confidence is increasing on an additional surface low spinning up
over the offshore waters on Friday, tracking ENE into inland waters.
SCA winds may remain over the Strait during this time. Weak surface
ridging rebuilds over the waters latter half of the weekend before
another front arrives on Monday.


Seas will build to 12 to 14 feet tonight and remain above 10 feet
into Friday. Another large swell train is expected by Sunday.
