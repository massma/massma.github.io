Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
247 PM PST Thu Nov 7 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A series of systems will then bring unsettled weather
starting Friday night and throughout early next week, consisting
of lowland rain, mountain snow, chances of thunder, and breezy
conditions.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mostly clear skies and
temperatures in the upper 50s and lower 60s today thanks to high
pressure. High clouds will continue to increase overnight with
lows in the 40s.

The next system stalls offshore on Friday keeping western WA
mainly dry. Temperatures will track warmer than average with highs
in the lower 60s again. Precip gradually spreads east and inland
Friday night and Saturday as a trough moves in for a rainy period
of weather. Given the slowness of the system, we`re looking at
rainfall totals ranging from 0.25-0.75" for most lowland areas.
Snow levels will be high, over 5000`, for mainly rain in the
mountains too. Brief ridging brings a short break in the weather
on Sunday. 33

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...A pair of deep upper lows
over the NE Pacific will help steer stronger and wetter systems
through western WA next week. Wave after wave of moisture/rain
will lead to rising rivers and possible river flooding,
especially the Skokomish River in Mason County. The air mass will
be slightly unstable too with a chance of thunderstorms (Sunday
night through Tuesday and mainly along the coast). Snow levels may
dip to around 3500-4000` with snow at the higher Cascade peaks
and passes. It`ll be breezy to locally windy too with highest
winds at the coast and north interior. Overall, a wet and blustery
week ahead. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The upper level ridge will continue to shift eastward,
allowing current westerly flow aloft to gradually transition to
southwesterly flow for Friday. Surface winds remain generally light
and variable, however two stand outs from this are HQM with easterly
winds ranging 4-8 kts and SEA being more west to northwesterly with
speeds a little lower at 3-6 kts.

VFR conditions area-wide and will remain that way for most terminals
throughout the TAF period. The only exceptions, as usual, will be
those locations more prone to lower cigs, such as OLM and PWT. Fog
with vis restrictions is expected late tonight and into Friday
morning for the aforementioned stations.

KSEA...VFR conditions in place and will remain for duration of TAF
period, although will see an increase in high clouds overnight.
Surface winds generally westerly at 3-6 kts into the early evening
before turning back to the southeast overnight with speeds generally
less than 5 kts. Southerly winds will emerge by Friday afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface ridging remains centered east of the Cascades
producing light offshore flow. A warm front will stall out over the
offshore waters tonight. A weak cold front will move across the
waters on Saturday before a much stronger frontal system follows
Sunday night into Monday.

Seas gradually increasing to 7 to 9 ft tonight. A small portion of
the northern coastal waters may see seas briefly at 10 ft, but not
widespread nor long lasting enough to warrant any headlines at this
time. The push to seas reaching 8 to 10 ft more uniform in both time
and space Friday evening...so additional headlines might be needed.
Active weather over the weekend will foster further wave growth, but
a strong front Monday will allow seas to increase sharply, up to 17
to 20 ft.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weakening frontal system will move through Western
Washington later Friday night and Saturday for increasing rain,
although at this time QPF amounts are expected to remain lighter. A
more significant chance of precipitation is expected Sunday through
Monday, and again on Wednesday as an active weather pattern returns.
At this time, the Skokomish River is the only river forecasted to
rise into flood stage, and potentially moderate flood stage during
the middle of next week. For other rivers, significant rises are
expected and flooding could be possible, but at this time is not
forecasted. Flooding extent will depend on rainfall rates,
temperatures, as well as snow levels with precipitation that falls
with each of these weather systems next week. River levels will
continue to be monitored during this period. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
