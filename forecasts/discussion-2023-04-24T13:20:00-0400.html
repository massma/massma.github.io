Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
120 PM EDT Mon Apr 24 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure will slowly build toward the area into Wednesday,
while a series of weak upper level disturbances move across. A
weak low pressure trough will then move across Wednesday night
into Thursday. High pressure returns briefly Thursday night.
Deepening low pressure passes to the south Friday into Saturday
night. Another low deepening low to the west impacts the region
Sunday into the beginning of next week.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
Forecast remains in on track for this aftn. Clouds across the
interior and across the forks of Long Island, and that should
remain the case for today. In fact, the cloud cover may expand
across the entire area this afternoon with approach of a mid
level shortwave trough to provide lift. Downslope WNW flow
should help temps to rise to the lower/mid 60s, then SW sea
breezes should develop along the coast this afternoon.

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
Clouds should linger tonight in weakly cyclonic low level flow,
especially inland NW of NYC where additional lift via a passing
mid level shortwave and the left exit region of an approaching
mid level jet streak will be present after midnight, which may
also spark an isolated rain or snow shower in Orange County.
Issued frost advisory for northernmost tier counties NW as
temps fall to the mid 30s; elsewhere lows should fall to the mid
40s in NYC, and the upper 30s/lower 40s in the suburbs and
along the coast.

A series of additional upper level jet streaks and mid level
vort maxima pivoting around a closed low over ern Canada may
provide another chance for diurnal showers across SE CT Tue
afternoon and then mainly NW of NYC Wed afternoon.

Temps in this air mass not expected to deviate much for Tue-Wed,
though temps late Tue night/early Wed morning may be a touch
colder outside of NYC, with another round of frost advisories
encompassing more of the interior possible.

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...
An upper low remains across southern Canada Wednesday night into
Thursday night. A shortwave moving into the upper low will
amplify a trough through the central states Friday into
Saturday, and then evolve into a negatively tilted trough that
will affect the area Sunday into the beginning of next week.
There will be some weak upper ridging across the area Thursday
into Friday. Meanwhile, at the surface a weak low, or surface
trough, moves through the region Wednesday night into Thursday.
High pressure builds remains to the north into the weekend,
moving east Sunday. This high will influence the track of a
deepening low that will move south of the area Friday into
Saturday night. With the uncertainty used the NBM probabilities,
with low end chance and slight chance across the area Friday
into Saturday night. The uncertainty the continues into Sunday
and next week with the evolution of surface low pressure
associated with the upper trough becoming negative, and where
the surface low will track, likely remaining well to the west of
the area. Once again, mainly used the NBM probabilities, and
capped at high end chance, lowering from the likely NBM
probabilities Sunday and Sunday night.

Temperatures through the extended period will be near seasonal
normals and used the NBM.
