Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
240 AM PST Tue Jan 28 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Chilly but dry conditions will persist through mid-
week. After a long dry spell, a wetter and slightly warmer system
will impact the region late Thursday through Friday bringing a
return of lowland rain and mountain snow. Cooler conditions are
favored to gradually return Saturday into next week and combined
with light precipitation could bring a change from rain to snow
to the western Washington lowlands.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Yet another early morning
under the ridge, bringing about what one would expect from this
weather pattern. Temps around W WA are similar to those of 24 hours
ago, with minor variances of a degree or two here and there. Obs as
of 1 AM PST reading generally in the mid to upper 20s while
locations immediately adjacent to water are still in the lower 30s.
Another aspect of the ridge, patchy fog, is having a slightly better
go at forming with satellite imagery showing a swath along the west
banks of the Sound as well as its typically preferred location at
the southern tip of the Sound, near Olympia.

There really is not much new to address in the short term, although
since the topic of fog has already been broached, it is worth
mentioning that the potential for it looks to increase both
overnight tonight and again Wednesday night. Areas impacted seem to
favor where development is occurring this early morning, although
could see spots along the coast and splotches along the eastern side
of the Sound from Tacoma all the way up to Bellingham. Obviously,
this will not be one uninterrupted band, hence the terminology
patchy...but even this bit of development will be more prolific than
what has been seen over the past few overnight/early morning
periods.

Daytime highs will by and large remain fairly static in the near
term, with most locations topping off in the lower to mid 40s each
day. This gets W WA at least a little closer to seasonal normals,
however still ending up falling short by approx 2-5 degrees.
Overnight lows tonight will not feel much different from what is
currently occurring, ranging in the mid 20s to around 30, however
temps nudge upward for Wednesday night with most lowland locations
seeing temps in the lower to mid 30s, likely thanks to advancing
clouds ahead of an incoming system.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...The breakdown of the upper
level ridge throughout the day Thursday will allow for a frontal
system to push into W WA very early Friday morning, and as the
parent upper low slowly sinks southward along the BC coast,
associated moisture...and therefore precip...will not be in a hurry
to go anywhere throughout the day. Conditions remain warm enough
that this initial wave will fall as rain in the lowlands, as
overnight lows Thursday night remain in the upper 30s to around 40
and highs Friday reach the upper 40s to around 50. However, with
overnight lows Friday night/early Saturday morning dipping into the
lower to mid 30s, the potential for either mixed precip or the white
stuff does need to be discussed. For the most part, ensembles
continue to favor rain for much of Friday night, but right around
sunrise Saturday morning, while still favoring rain, the margin is
much narrower, with votes breaking down 50 pct for rain, 40 pct for
snow /and apparently 10 pct abstaining/. Much of the day Saturday
goes back to favoring rain...but the threat of mixed precip never
really goes away. By the time Saturday night rolls around, ensembles
do shift their preference to snow, which would certainly be
supported by lowland overnight lows mainly in the lower 30s, but
even here chances for snow seem to top out just at little north of
40 pct. Not the best of odds. Ensemble PoPs are not exactly offering
resounding support either, ranging up to around 50 pct, but with
means around 20 pct...well, sufficed to say, one does need
precipitation before pondering the state it will fall in. Obviously,
models and forecasts will need to be monitored in the days ahead to
get a better feeling as to if, when and how much snow may fall in
the lowlands.

Monday sees this upper low shift westward out over the Pacific and
drawing away from W WA. The thing to watch will be whether or not it
will be able to tap into a plume of moisture running to the south of
it...and if so, where will it be aimed. Deterministic models in some
vague agreement that this might actually pass south of much of W WA
and be lifted into the Cascades and eastern portions of the state.
Ensembles are having a difficult time focusing on the feature and
this shows both in the NBM churning out indecisive 50 pct PoPs for
much of the CWA and ensembles arriving at some outliers within that
range, but the mean overall falling well short of that, approx 20-30
pct. Current temp forecast for Monday might once again end up
favoring a wintery mix, should precip occur, with daytime highs in
the upper 30s to around 40 and overnight lows still lingering in the
upper 20s to around 30.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>North/northwesterly flow aloft as ridging continues over
the region, with offshore flow in the lower levels. VFR across most
terminals early this morning with patchy fog developing near KBLI
and creating localized IFR/LIFR. Fog development overnight expected
to expand southward for fog-prone terminals including KPWT and KOLM
before conditions improve late morning. N/NE winds generally 5 kt or
less through the morning increasing to 4 to 8 kt this afternoon.

KSEA...VFR this evening with light N/NE winds continuing into the
overnight period. Latest guidance shows around a 25% chance of
lowered conditions (IFR/LIFR) due to fog development, but confidence
is low that fog will reach the terminal. Otherwise, VFR conditions
are on track to persist with generally light winds. Winds turning
S/SE later this evening.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface high pressure ridge persists over the offshore
waters for generally calm and benign marine conditions. The
aforementioned high pressure will gradually weaken into Wednesday
with a front moving over the waters into Thursday. Increasing winds
over the coastal waters may lead to a Small Craft Advisory later
Thursday into Friday.

Combined seas generally 2 to 5 feet through midweek, rising to
around 7 to 10 feet by the end of the week and into the weekend as a
more active weather pattern approaches.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>From Previous Discussion...No river flooding is
expected over the next 7 days as abnormally dry conditions continue.
However, with the precipitation coming towards the end of the week,
the Skokomish River is forecast to rise substantially above Action
Stage. There will be much uncertainty with the river forecast all
the way into the event given the current below normal flows and the
snow and ice build up in the basin over this recent dry but cold
period. As far as other rivers, only low elevation basins like the
Chehalis, Samish, and Stillaguamish Rivers will see much response at
all.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.CLIMATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>From Previous Discussion...The record dry spell in
Seattle in January is 15 days, January 16-30, 1963. Counting today
the current streak is at 11 days. Two 12 day streaks are tied for
the second longest, January 19-30, 1945 and January 11-22, 2013.
