.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An atmospheric river storm system will continue to move
into the Pacific Northwest tonight, bringing in widespread
precipitation alongside gusty winds. Unsettled conditions will
continue through Thursday ahead of a brief break. Another system is
on track to enter the region over the weekend for continued cool and
wet conditions.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong storm system will
continue to move into western Washington tonight, bringing in
moderate to heavy lowland rain and mountain snow alongside gusty
winds. Precipitation and gusty winds will continue to spread inland
tonight, with snow levels initially near 5000-5500 ft. The parent
upper level low will cycle offshore on Wednesday and shift inland on
Thursday, maintaining unsettled and wet conditions through mid-week
and bringing snow levels closer to 4000 ft. The bulk of the incoming
moisture associated with this atmospheric river pattern will be
centered over the Olympics, where up to 4 to 7 inches of liquid is
possible through Thursday. The North Cascades will also see a large
influx of moisture, with up to 4 inches of liquid through Thursday.
Areas elsewhere will see roughly 1 to 2 inches of rainfall. Higher
elevations of the mountains will see several inches of snow
accumulation as this system passes over the region, with most
Cascade passes seeing a few inches of snow accumulation through the
period. The bulk of the snowfall is on track to fall over the North
Cascades, where snowfall totals could reach 1 to 2 feet through
Thursday. Additional hazards with this system include the potential
for coastal flooding, isolated river flooding, and thunderstorms.
Details on hazards are outlined below:

* WIND: Winds will continue to increase this evening and
  overnight, with widespread gusts of 35 to 45 mph. The strongest
  winds will occur along the coast and for the lowlands north of
  Everett in the early morning hours Wednesday, where gusts could
  reach 55 to 60 mph. Winds will gradually ease throughout the
  day Wednesday.

* MOUNTAIN SNOW: Snow levels will hover between 4000-5500 ft over
  the mountains, with periods of heavy snow over the North Cascades
  through Thursday. A Winter Storm Warning is in effect for snow
  accumulations of 12-24 inches above 4000 ft over the North
  Cascades through Thursday.

* RIVER FLOODING: Rises to area rivers will continue as widespread
  precipitation enters the region. At this time, the Skokomish River
  is forecast to enter Moderate Flood stage by Wednesday morning,
  and a Flood Warning remains in effect. Other rivers continue to be
  monitored, including the Bogachiel where a Flood Watch is in
  effect.

* THUNDERSTORMS: Storms are possible mainly along the Pacific Coast
  Wednesday, capable of producing gusty winds, small hail, and
  locally heavy rain. A brief waterspout cannot be ruled out.

* COASTAL FLOODING: Minor tidal overflow is possible along
  shorelines and low-lying coastal areas Wednesday and Thursday, and
  the potential for the inland waters continues to be monitored.

Precipitation is on track to decrease throughout the day on Thursday
as the upper level low slowly shifts eastward. Scattered shower
activity will continue, but is favored over higher terrain.
Temperatures through the short term will remain fairly steady, with
highs in the low to mid 50s across the lowlands and lows dipping
into the 40s.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Forecast models continue to
show good agreement over brief drying on Friday as weak high
pressure builds inland, though cloudy skies will linger across
western Washington. Another storm system will be close behind,
moving over the region over the weekend. Snow levels remain on
track to fall to 2500-3000 feet over the weekend, likely bringing
accumulating snowfall to the Cascade passes. However, the details
still remain uncertain at this time. Forecast confidence
decreases heading into next week, with deterministic models
showing potential for high pressure and drying while ensembles
maintain cool and wet conditions.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong frontal (atmospheric river system) will push
through the region beginning tonight through Thursday. Pre-frontal
showers are moving across the terminals this afternoon. Rain rates
have been enough to drop ceilings visibilities down to MVFR/IFR at
times. More substantial rain bands will move inland this evening
into Wednesday with heavier rainfall rates. The best chance of
thunderstorms will be around and west of the Olympics to the coast,
and over the Pacific Ocean. A few stronger storms will be possible
Wednesday (small hail/gusty winds), with the best chance being west
and northeast of Puget Sound with a possible Wednesday afternoon
convergence zone).

Main concern with the frontal passage tonight is strong winds and
low level wind shear. Sounding profiles clearly show veering winds
from the surface (out of the south) to the west not too high aloft.
The strongest winds will be along waterways, where wind gusts at the
surface may peak out of the south at 30 to 45 kt. Low level wind
shear at 2,000 ft of up to 45 kt may cause sudden gains/losses to
aircraft. The strongest winds will arrive late this evening into
Wednesday morning, with the wind shear threat ending by 15Z. The
remainder of Wednesday will still see gusty south winds peaking at
20-30 kt, but without the threat for low level wind shear.

KSEA...Pre-frontal showers beginning to move in and around the
terminal (briefly dropping ceilings to MVFR). More widespread rain
should arrive after 01-03Z, with drops of visibilities likely. The
strongest winds will arrive after 05Z, peaking around 10Z early
Wednesday morning. Southwest winds of 10 to 20 kt with gusts to 35
kt will be possible. Remainder of Wednesday will see south winds of
10-15 gusting to 25 kt. Ceilings will decrease to MVFR Wednesday for
a majority of the day.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong frontal/atmospheric river system will create
strong southerly winds this evening/overnight and produce widespread
precipitation across the waters. Pre frontal showers are currently
moving over the coastal waters inland this afternoon, with more
widespread precipitation expected to arrive later this evening
(potentially dropping visibilities to mariners). The threat of
thunderstorms is primarily concentrated over the coastal waters,
where SPC has a marginal risk of severe weather Wednesday with the
threat of hail/wind (possibility of a waterspout).

Main focus tonight/tomorrow however will be wind. Models have
increased probabilities of seeing frequent storm-force wind gusts
over a majority of the coastal waters, and the eastern Strait of
Juan de Fuca for a 6 hour window tonight (as the front moves
through), and also gales in the central Strait of Juan de Fuca and
Admiralty Inlet. These areas received hazard upgrades to storm and
gale warnings with the afternoon forecast update. The strongest
winds are expected late tonight into early Wednesday morning, with
gusts in the storm warned areas expected to exceed 50 kt. The gale
warned areas will see gusts to 35 to 45 kt. Seas will also increase
up to 15 to 19 feet, with the highest seas down towards Grays
Harbor/Portland.

The winds will drop going into Wednesday afternoon, but will still
remain gusty through late Wednesday evening. The next area of gusty
winds will arrive with a system next weekend, and early next week,
but will remain primarily an issue for small craft. Seas will drop
to 8 to 12 feet late Wednesday, but increase back up to 15 to 18
feet Thursday into early Friday, before decreasing to 6 to 8 feet
Friday into next weekend.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Rain ahead of a strong cold front is beginning to work
its way onshore this afternoon. Rain will continue tonight into
Wednesday, with periods of heavy rain possible tonight. Additional
rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches with locally higher amounts up to
5 to 6 inches possible over the Olympic Peninsula and portions of
the North Cascades. Expect significant rises on area rivers,
particularly over the Olympic Peninsula. A Flood Warning is in
effect for the Skokomish River, which should reach flood stage late
tonight and peak at moderate stage Wednesday morning. A Flood Watch
is in effect for the Bogachiel River near La Push, which is forecast
to approach minor flood stage Wednesday morning.

Elsewhere, expect rises on area rivers to continue as the next round
of widespread rainfall moves through. At this time, river flooding
looks less likely for Cascade-basin rivers with snow expected for
the mountains. Snow levels will vary, however, lowering from around
5500 ft tonight down to 4000 ft by tomorrow night, which will
continue to impact precipitation type and the amount of storm
runoff. Any additional flooding extent will continue to depend on
rainfall rates, temperatures, and snow levels--which will continue
to be monitored.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
