.SYNOPSIS...Upper level ridge centered offshore building into
Western Washington today. The ridge will remain over the area
tonight then weaken and move east Tuesday. Front moving into the
back side of the ridge falling apart as it moves over the area
Tuesday night. Another upper level ridge offshore building
Wednesday shifting inland Thursday. Ridge moving into Eastern
Washington Thursday night with a more organized front arriving
Friday. Another upper level ridge building offshore for the
weekend but not close enough to the area to prevent weak systems
from sliding down the British Columbia coast into Western
Washington.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The main story for the
next week is pretty benign weather for January in Western
Washington. No changes were made to the forecast this morning. The
previous discussion can be found below along with updated
aviation and marine discussions:

Upper level ridge offshore building into Western Washington today.
The forecast problem for the day is how long the low clouds hang
around in the lowlands. Early morning top reports from aircraft
flying into Seattle-Tacoma airport have the tops 2000-2500 msl and
the cloud layer 1000-1500 feet thick. KOLM-KBLI gradient below -2
mb and will stay that way this morning so expect what is left of
the fog to dissipate by mid morning. The cloud cover is another
matter. Subsidence from the upper level ridge building into the
area will help compress the low level moisture layer but model
soundings show light winds above the surface and the inversion
not breaking until this afternoon. 1500 feet of moisture will take
a little time to dissipate under these conditions. Will word the
forecast cloudy in the morning becoming sunny in the afternoon for
most of the lowlands. It will be a sunny day in the higher
elevations. Highs today in the mid 40s to lower 50s.

Upper level ridge remaining over the area tonight. Northerly
surface gradients relaxing overnight with KOLM-KBLI gradient back
to 0 to -1 mb by 12z Tuesday. Light winds continuing right above
the surface. Expect areas of fog to develop overnight as
temperatures with the clear skies drop down to near or just below
freezing in many places.

Morning fog and low cloud layer will be more shallow Tuesday
morning making for a quicker dissipation of the layer. Upper
level ridge shifting east with middle and high level clouds out
ahead of an approaching system reaching Western Washington. The
combination of the morning low clouds and fog plus increasing high
level clouds in the afternoon makes for a mostly cloudy forecast.
There is the potential for a colorful sunset late Tuesday
afternoon.

Upper level ridge well to the east Tuesday night with a weakening
front moving through the area. Not much left of the front by the
time it arrives. Chance pops for most of the area overnight with a
little rain likely for the North Coast and some light snow for the
North Cascades and Olympics. Lows Tuesday night in the mid 30s to
lower 40s.

Another upper level ridge rebuilding offshore Wednesday giving
Western Washington dry northwesterly flow aloft and at least
partly sunny skies.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement in the first half of the extended with the upper level
ridge shifting east Thursday and a more organized front arriving
Friday. At this point snow levels look to be around 4000 feet.
Front is fairly progressive and will be east of the area Friday
night. Another upper level ridge building offshore Saturday. Here
is where the model solutions differ. The GFS has the upper level
ridge axis closer to Western Washington versus the ECMWF. The
ECMWF upper level ridge axis is further offshore allowing weak
systems to slide down the British Columbia coast into Western
Washington over the weekend. Both model ensemble solutions
support the operational runs. The ECMWF has been verifying better
in the longer term recently so will have some slight chance pops
over the weekend in the area. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge centered offshore will gradually
build into the region today with northerly flow aloft continuing.
The low level flow is light offshore. Widespread low level moisture
remains in place across the lowland interior of Western Washington
with LIFR/IFR ceilings and localized surface visibilities below 2SM.
Stratus and fog will gradually lift and scatter for most areas
after around 20Z, but may persist through much of the day across
the Southwest Interior. Clearing skies expected by early this
evening and light surface gradients will be favorable for the
formation of LIFR fog and surface visibilities below 1SM across
much of the area late tonight into Tuesday morning.

KSEA...IFR ceilings and N/NE winds 7 to 10 kt are likely to
continue into late this morning. Expecting a general lifting and
eventual scattering out of the low clouds for a period mid-
afternoon into this evening. LIFR conditions are likely to
redevelop late tonight and persist into Tuesday morning. Surface
winds will be E/NE overnight tonight and ease to 4 to 7 kt. 27/14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strengthening surface ridge will remain in place across
southern British Columbia and NE Washington State into Tuesday
providing low level offshore flow. A dissipating front will move
into area waters around midweek producing little impact. High
pressure will then rebuild over the region Thursday before a front
arrives on Friday.

A long period westerly swell has moved into the coastal waters
this morning and interacted with a more dominant, shorter period
wave group. This could continue to bring a period of confused
seas to the coastal waters this morning before the swell becomes
the more dominant wave group. Latest observations show seas generally
persisting at 7 to 9 feet at 17 to 20 seconds. Seas over portions
of the coastal waters will also build towards 10 feet by tonight
and again near midweek. 27/14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
