.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper low, now
centered over eastern WA, will weaken and dissipate tonight while
a brief ridge moves in from the west. For western WA, showers are
mostly light and disorganized, and will fade out this evening.

More wet weather is in store for Monday as another Pacific frontal
system moves in. We`ll be in post-frontal onshore flow Monday

convergence zone may form over the north sound with showers
lingering over the north Cascades Monday night. Snow levels are

Western WA is under zonal/onshore flow through midweek with broad
troughing over western Canada. Weak systems will clip us keeping a
chance of showers in the forecast through the period. Temperatures
continue to track cooler than average with daytime highs around
60. 33

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...We`re still under the
influence of westerly flow aloft and onshore flow near the surface
through the end of the week. This keeps us partly to mostly cloudy
with a chance of showers. The air mass will moderate slightly and
temperatures will track closer to average. Drier and warmer
weather is in store next weekend as a ridge builds over the West.
Highs are back into the 70s on Sunday, with 60s along the coast.
