Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
822 AM PDT Sat Mar 22 2025

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Lingering convergence zone activity continues across
Skagit and Snohomish Counties this morning, with upslope slow in
the upper elevations of the Cascades. Precipitation will briefly
taper off this afternoon ahead of a warm front that will approach
Western Washington tonight. No major forecast updates this
morning. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...Northwesterly flow aloft with showers decreasing
today. Atmospheric river reaching the coast tonight with most of
the moisture moving inland to the north. The river will sag south
over Western Washington Sunday and remain into Monday. Upper
level ridge building Monday night and Tuesday cutting off the
flow of moisture and pushing it north into British Columbia.
Ridge shifts east Wednesday with upper level low dominating the
weather into the end of the week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Satellite imagery showing a
mix of clouds and some clearing over the area early this morning.
Doppler radar has showers mainly along the coast and in a
convergence zone over Skagit and Snohomish counties. Temperatures
on the cool side at 3 am/10z, in the mid 30s to lower 40s.

Northwesterly flow aloft today over Western Washington with an
upper level trough to the east. Air mass stabilizing as the day
wears on with some warm advection out ahead of the approaching
atmospheric river. This weak warm advection will wipe out most of
the shower activity by early afternoon. Convergence zone
remaining intact, but not moving much, most of the morning before
dissipating. Highs a couple of degrees either side of 50.

Atmospheric river on the march across the eastern Pacific tonight
moving into Vancouver Island overnight. Warm front dragging over
Western Washington after midnight bringing rain back to the area.
Snow levels trending upwards but still below pass levels from
Snoqualmie Pass northward but with the precipitation arriving late
new snow amounts not enough for an advisory. Lows in the lower to
mid 40s.

Atmospheric river sagging south over the area Sunday with the
river remaining over Western Washington into Monday. Upper level
ridge starting to build from the south Monday afternoon will begin
to cut off and push the moisture north for a possible drying trend
Monday afternoon over the Southwest Interior. Snow levels rising
into the 6000 to 7000 foot range. Seattle March rainfall through
the 21st is 3.17 inches, exactly one inch below the March monthly
normal rainfall of 4.17 inches. There is a chance by late Monday
afternoon Seattle will be over the monthly normal rainfall. If
this occurs it will be the first time since 2017 that Seattle has
had above normal rainfall in March. The seven year streak of below
normal rainfall is currently the longest streak of any month.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Ridge continuing to build
Monday night and Tuesday eventually pushing the moisture north of
the area. Will keep a chance of rain near the Canadian border and
along the coast Tuesday. Models are trending drier so look for
even this chance of rain to get removed from the forecast in
future packages. Very warm air mass for March associated with the
ridge with record high temperatures forecast for Tuesday. Now
better than 50 percent chance the Southwest Interior sees the
first 70s of the year.

Upper level ridge continuing to build Tuesday night in response to
a deepening upper level low well off the coast. Ridge axis
shifting east of the area Tuesday night.

If you are looking for a great set up for convection in Western
Washington look at the model solutions Wednesday. Record warm air
mass over the area with a negatively tilted trough moving into
this air mass late in the day/time of maximum heating. Since it
is day 5 there is plenty of time for the models to go away from
this scenario so for now will just have a slight chance of
thunderstorms Wednesday in addition to increasing showers later
in the day. If you are a chaser Wednesday could provide one of
those rare days to go chasing in Western Washington and Oregon.
Another very warm day with highs in the 60s.

Upper level low taking up residence off the Washington coast
Wednesday night. A series of impulses rotating out of the low
will bring showers, heavy at times, to the area Wednesday night
into Friday. Highs will cool back into the lower to mid 50s and
snow levels will lower back down to pass levels. Felton

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mostly VFR this morning with areas of MVFR to IFR
ceilings across terminals surrounding the Puget Sound. Ongoing
convergence zone showers continue across the Snohomish/Skagit
County line this morning with isolated light shower activity
elsewhere, with weak ridging allowing conditions to dry out by the
early afternoon and allowing all terminals to rebound to VFR.
Surface winds generally south to southwest 5-10 kt.

The next system will spread MVFR to IFR precipitation inland this
evening, with widespread precip continuing through early Monday
before shifting northward. Deteriorated conditions are expected
throughout the day Sunday with low ceilings persisting and pockets
of reduced visibility in/around stronger showers. South winds will
increase throughout the day Sunday becoming 8 to 18 kt with gusts
peaking between 25-35 kt Sunday afternoon.

KSEA...IFR ceilings this morning improving to VFR by 18z-19z.
Conditions will remain dry through the afternoon with S to SW winds
8 to 11 kt. Winds will decrease and turn more southerly overnight,
with MVFR rain moving over the terminal after 03z Sun. KSEA may see
some rain shadowing, at least initially, as rain moves in, but
conditions should deteriorate to IFR in rain overnight. Forecast
models favor IFR conditions to continue throughout the day Sunday as
rain continues. Southerly winds will increase by early Sunday
afternoon, with a moderate (50% to 60%) chance of wind gusts
exceeding 20 kt between 20z-01z and a maximum wind gust of 30-35 kt.

.MARINE...Onshore flow from a exiting surface trough will decrease
throughout the morning. Surface ridging looks to briefly build
over the coastal waters later this morning before shifting inland
into the afternoon with a warm front passing over the waters,
bringing small craft southerlies. High pressure looks to build
over the waters Monday into Tuesday for calmer conditions, before
another frontal system enters the area on Wednesday for another
round of elevated winds and seas.

Combined seas hovering around 8 to 11 feet will remain throughout
the weekend before subsiding below 10 feet early next week.

.HYDROLOGY...Precipitation increasing late tonight with the rain
continuing into Monday. Snow levels rising to at least 7000 feet.
Rivers will be on the rise beginning Sunday across Western
Washington. Right now only the Skokomish River in Mason county is
forecast to exceed flood stage, most likely Sunday night.
With the significant precipitation in the area we will be
monitoring other area rivers during this period. Drier weather is
expected Monday night into Tuesday. Unsettled weather returns
midweek. Felton
