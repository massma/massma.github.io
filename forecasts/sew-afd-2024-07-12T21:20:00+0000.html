Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
220 PM PDT Fri Jul 12 2024

.SYNOPSIS...An upper level ridge remains over Western Washington
through the weekend into next week with continued low level
onshore flow. This will maintain above normal temperatures, but
still notably cooler than the start of this week. No rain expected
with only subtle variations in the strength of the marine pushes
each night.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Sunny skies continue across
interior Western Washington, while low stratus has been slow to
erode along the coastline. Expect these daily stratus pushes to
move into the coast with temperatures closer to normal in the
areas that see clouds. Meanwhile, temperatures remain above normal
through the interior with temperatures warming a bit on Saturday
to the upper 80s to around 90 as the onshore flow weakens.
Otherwise, a rather persistent pattern remains through the start
of next week.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The start of next week looks
largely similar with decent agreement among the ensemble guidance.
This will maintain onshore flow through the week and high temperatures
in the mid to upper 80s through the interior. The guidance does
diverge a little bit later in the week, with some of ensemble
members suggesting a deeper trough over the Pacific approaches the
region. This opens to door to some favorable flow to increase some
convection in the Cascades as a weak front moves toward the area.
Still lower confidence in this scenario with the most likely
outcome is continued dry conditions, but some light precipitation
for at least part of the area can`t be totally ruled out.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft over W WA as zonal aloft
continues. VFR persists at all area terminals this afternoon, with the
exception being KHQM where marine stratus continues to create MVFR
conditions. Stratus will return to coastal airfields tonight and
continue through Saturday morning, with MVFR/IFR conditions.
Elsewhere, VFR will persist through the period with clear skies.

KSEA...VFR will continue through the TAF period. N/NW winds 5 to
10 knots will become light tonight through Saturday morning.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure continues to be situated offshore
while low pressure remains inland. A small craft advisory will
continue over the outer coastal waters for increased
northwesterlies. Diurnal westerlies will persist into early next
week with additional headlines for the Strait.

Coastal seas 6 to 8 feet this afternoon with the highest waves
over the coastal waters. Seas will then decrease to 4 to 6 feet
into the weekend and into early next week.
