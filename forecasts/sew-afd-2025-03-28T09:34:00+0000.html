Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
234 AM PDT Fri Mar 28 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A broad trough of low pressure will continue to
produce cool and showery conditions into Saturday. A weak ridge of
high pressure will provide drier and mild conditions on Sunday
before another trough arrives early in the coming week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A broad trough of low
pressure offshore will continue to produce periods of showers
across Western Washington into tonight as it gradually lifts
northward offshore. Temperatures across the area will be right
around normal...generally low to mid 50s for daytime highs and
overnight lows in the 40s. Shower coverage will diminish on
Saturday as the trough lifts northward and weak shortwave ridging
starts to build into the area. The ridge axis will shift east of
the Cascades on Sunday as another trough axis digs southward
offshore. All in all, Sunday looks like a pleasant spring day with
mostly dry conditions and portions of the interior lowlands
nudging into the lower 60s. A few showers ahead of the next trough
offshore could reach coastal areas by Sunday evening.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...The next upper trough
offshore will spread more showers across Western Washington on
Monday with temperatures cooling a few degrees. Much like the
current system, the trough is expected to wobble just offshore for
additional showery periods and cool temperatures continuing into
Tuesday. By the middle of next week, the forecast picture turns a
little murky as sharp differences start to show themselves in
model ensembles. This isn`t terribly surprising as models
can have a tough time during the transition between seasons.

Ensembles anomalies place broad troughing over the Western U.S.
by the middle of next week, but seem to have trouble resolving
what happens upstream over the Gulf of Alaska. This, of course,
can have substantial influence over the forecast for Western
Washington. For now, shower chances remain in the forecast for
Wednesday and Thursday with near seasonal temperatures. There are
hints of a possible drier and warmer period by the end of next
week...especially among the Euro ensemble members.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft Friday-Friday night as an upper-
low progresses. Cigs VFR currently, occasionally MVFR under heavier
showers. Rain and showers will become more widespread as the day
progress with MVFR conditions increasing in coverage as well. Breezy
southerly winds increase though much of the day with gusts reaching
the 20-25 kt range. Showers to persist on Saturday but of lesser
coverage along with a mix of low-end VFR to MVFR cigs.

KSEA...Widespread rain showers over the terminal today, eventually
becoming less frequent into the evening. VFR cigs currently but as
rain and showers increase this morning, the chance for MVFR
conditions will increase. Probabilities of cigs below 3,000 ft are
60-80% mid-morning into the afternoon. Southerly wind gusts up to 25
kt before decreasing into the evening. Cigs become mostly VFR this
evening as well as shower coverage wane. However, more low clouds
are possible into early Saturday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface low centered off the coast will
move north towards British Columbia today. As a result, SCAs over
the inland water zones will be allowed to expire this evening.
However, high seas over the coastal waters, Grays Harbor, and West
Strait will maintain SCAs into early Saturday. Seas 10 to 14 ft
today before decreasing to 6 to 8 ft by Saturday evening. Going
through the weekend, the pattern will briefly relax Saturday night-
Sunday with transient surface high pressure. The next frontal system
looks to arrive on Monday with SCA winds before exiting on Tuesday.
More activity is slated to follow after midweek.

.HYDROLOGY...With on and off precipitation expected through
Saturday and a break on Sunday, most area rivers are not expected
to respond drastically. Even the forecast for the Skokomish river
has come down to a brief period of minor flood stage on Saturday.
Conditions will be monitored over the basin but for now the flood
watch will remain in effect.
