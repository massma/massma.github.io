Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
220 AM PDT Thu Sep 5 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong upper level ridge combined with low level
offshore flow will lead to unseasonably warm temperatures through
Friday. The ridge will slowly weaken and slide eastward over the
weekend for increasing onshore flow and a cooling trend. Troughing
will develop offshore early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>What a difference 24 hours
makes... A strong upper ridge axis is overhead and the switch to
low level offshore flow is well underway. A cursory look at some
of the current observations in the thermal belt of the Olympic
Mountains are quite impressive with widespread temperatures in the
70s at 2000 to 3000 feet and relative humidity values a paltry 15
to 25 percent. This is the kind of air mass that lower elevations
will be tapping into after the sun comes up and mixing begins.
Numerous locations are nearly assured to surpass daily record high
temperatures and it wouldn`t be at all surprising if several
record high minimums occur as well. Thermally induced low pressure
at the surface will shift ever so slightly inland on Friday
allowing immediate coastal areas a cooling afternoon sea breeze,
but much of interior lowlands will see a near repeat of today`s
temperatures. As is often the case with late season warm spells,
the duration will be relatively short as upper ridging weakens and
low level onshore increases. Models continue to hint at a weak
upper level disturbance lifting northward across the region late
Saturday. This could become the mechanism for some thunderstorm
activity in the central Cascades, but confidence isn`t high enough
to include in the forecast at this time.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...A cooling trend continues
into Sunday. Upper level ridging centered well to our east will
maintain enough influence to keep the region dry, but temperatures
will be back closer to seasonal values. Ensembles continue with
the idea of anomalous upper troughing developing well offshore
early next week. Initially, it likely won`t produce much more than
night and morning clouds and temperatures around normal. However,
by the middle of the coming week, we could be talking about a
frontal system with enough stamina to actually make it onshore and
produce some light precipitation. Stay tuned. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure centered over the region with increasing
offshore flow in the lower levels. Expect less available moisture
with the strengthening inversion and offshore flow, but a few
patches of low IFR fog/stratus again possible this early morning,
mostly along the coast and parts of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Any
fog will be shallow and not last too long after daybreak, with VFR
under clear skies and increasing winds from the north/east Thursday
afternoon. Some elevated haze is possible in the far south and east
late in the period due to smoke from regional fires that may move
into the region.

KSEA...VFR conditions under clear skies and light northerly flow
through mid-morning. With increasingly diminishing moisture, chances
for fog or shallow stratus far less, with models generously
assigning a probability around 10%. Increasing north/northeast
surface winds to 10 kt by noon and remaining that way into the
evening before some slight easing tonight.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Strong upper level ridging remains over W WA again today
as thermal pressure trough makes its way eastward, continuing
offshore/easterly flow over interior waters and northerlies over the
coastal waters. Some patches of early morning fog possible...mainly
within the Strait...but neither as widespread nor as thick as
yesterday.

Onshore flow returns Friday with surface high pressure building over
the coastal waters and the thermal pressure trough exiting the area.
The resulting northwesterlies over the coastal waters will allow for
wind speeds to increase up to around 20 kts...perhaps with isolated
gusts nudging into SCA criteria...but headline conditions not
expected to be widespread and thus no need for such at this time.
Surface flow will become southerly early next week as the next
disturbance brings a chance of rain showers to the region.

Seas generally 5 to 7 feet and remaining that way for much of the
remainder of the week before decreasing to 3 to 5 feet Sunday.
Expect shorter periods and more wind-driven seas today and Friday
once winds transition to northwesterlies.

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridging and an associated surface
thermal trough along the coast will allow conditions to become
increasingly warm, dry, and unstable. As fuels rapidly dry, these
conditions will combine to create critical fire weather conditions
over the mountains today. A return to onshore flow on Friday over
the Olympic Peninsula will begin to bring cooler, moist air to
the Olympics while the Cascades remain warm, dry and unstable.

Winds will also turn easterly over the Cascades. While they will
not be overly strong, a period of gusty winds is expected into
early Thursday morning as air funnels through the gaps over the
Cascade crest. Another period of offshore flow is expected
Thursday night into Friday, but it looks to be less strong.

Fire Weather Watches have been upgraded to Red Flag Warnings.
Winds over the North Cascades do not look to be as strong as those
over the central Cascades, therefore the start time has been
pushed back to tomorrow morning, focusing on the threat from dry
and unstable conditions.

Cooler and more moist air will return area-wide through the weekend
with the potential of some wetting rains by the middle of next
week. LH/27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
