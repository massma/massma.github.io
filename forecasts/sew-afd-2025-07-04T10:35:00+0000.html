Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
335 AM PDT Fri Jul 4 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Seasonably warm weather for the 4th of July holiday
is expected as a weak trough pushes through the area. A warming
trend is expected by early next week as a ridge of high pressure
build across the western states. Temperatures are trending above
average for both Monday and Tuesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak trough offshore is
entering the region as its base noses into Oregon and northern
California. Thunderstorms have been observed with this disturbance
but are well away from the CWA as they track through central
Oregon and the rest of the Inland Northwest as the day progress.
Can`t rule out a slight chance (15%) of showers over the north
Cascades this afternoon. Otherwise, a pleasant day is in store for
the 4th of July holiday. Seasonal temperatures are expected with
highs forecast to be in the lower to mid 70s across the interior.
Coastal areas generally in the 60s. Tonight, dry conditions will
remain as the aforementioned trough is modeled to be well east of
the Cascades. Overnight lows will fall into the mid 40s to lower
50s.

More zonal flow aloft Saturday into Sunday with dry and near
normal conditions favored. A modest warm up will be felt on Sunday
however as heights rise, influenced by troughing off the coast of
California and high pressure over the Four Corners region. High
temperatures will again be mostly in the 70s but some 80s are
possible to creep up through the SW interior and Cascade valleys
on Sunday. Overnight lows in the 40s and 50s.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...A warming trend is favored
to persist into Monday and Tuesday as above average temperatures
become more widespread. Highs will top out in the 80s, potentially
near 90 for areas within the Cascade valleys. With lows around 60
for Tuesday morning around the Seattle metro, there is the
potential for moderate Heatrisk for those who are sensitive to
heat and without adequate cooling/hydration. Going forward, some
uncertainty exists by mid week on the exact evolution of the mid-
level pattern. However, temperatures are trending cooler in the
most recent models runs as a reprieve from the heat is appearing
more favorable for Wednesday and Thursday.
