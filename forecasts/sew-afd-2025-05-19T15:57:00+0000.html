Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
857 AM PDT Mon May 19 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system will move east of the area today,
leaving scattered showers and a possible rumble of thunder
through the rest of the day. Shower chances will decrease
through the week as temperatures warm up into next weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The main band of precipitation associated with todays
frontal system is now situated in the Cascades and is moving
east. Isolated showers in the wake of this system are expected
to become more scattered in nature by this afternoon. Weak
instability may allow for some isolated thunder this afternoon
and evening. The forecast has been adjusted slightly to account
for the latest trends and short range guidance. -Wolcott-<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level analysis
shows a trough with the axis just offshore, and the center of
the low right around Haida Gwaii. An occluded front drifts from
this low offshore down to about 100 mi offshore of Neah Bay
(where it`s still a warm and cold front down to the California
coast). This will be the main driver for precipitation across
our region today.

Radar is pretty active already this morning. Bands of rain are
making their way inland from the front, with the main grouping
passing north of the Olympics through the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
Additional bands are making their way along the whole coast, and
models track this activity well inland through the morning and
afternoon. This will be the primary area of precipitation with the
frontal system passing through today. The initial warm front will
also produce gusty south winds through the morning hours (gusts up
to 30 mph, with highest gusts along coastal waters in the interior
and Pacific Ocean, and the South Interior). If you`re commuting
this morning, be prepared for some ponding on the roads and breezy
winds. This initial round of rain will drop around a quarter of an
inch in most lowland areas, most likely 0.75 inches along the
coast, and up to an inch in the mountains (highest totals at
peaks).

Once both fronts (warm and cold) pass through by this afternoon,
it will be predominately post-frontal convergence zone activity
(along with the trough remaining overhead a little bit longer with
some left-exit region jet streak support to the south along the
WA/OR border. The air also cools aloft to the point where NBM was
putting a slight (20% chance) of thunder for the coast/Olympics,
and a good chunk of the west slopes of the Cascades (out to as far
as the Everett area). There`s not a clear classic signal of a
convergence zone. It appears rather the activity will be scattered
out with multiple discrete or clusters of showers/possible
thunderstorms. This activity will likely last into Tuesday morning
(with the thunder threat ending after sunset). Snow levels will
remain above pass levels with this system (so should not see any
impacts with snow sticking to the roads).

The jetstreak/trough feature will slide slightly eastward Tuesday
into Wednesday. This will drop the shower chances down to
primarily the mountains and north Tuesday into Wednesday. Any
showers that do form will be light. Highs will remain cool in the
low 60s for most lowland areas (drops into the 40s and 50s into
the mountains/slopes). Lows will drop into the mid 40s (30s in the
mountains).

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...The slight shower chances
continue into Thursday (there is a weak trough that passes through
earlier in the morning). The ensembles pick more of a warmer/drier
solution now going into the weekend as a couple of ridges pass
through (though another weak trough may pass through Friday but
appears to be light in the way of any showers). Sky coverage
appears to be a mix of clouds/blue sky going through this time. As
such the deterministic temperature forecast for Sunday/Monday
dropped a bit compared to 24 hours ago (looking at only low 70s in
the lowlands for now). If there is a more clearing solution
getting closer into next week, it could easily be a situation
where temperatures are much warmer (up to 10 degrees warmer).

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper trough will be across the Pacific Northwest
into Tuesday for continued west-southwest flow aloft. Onshore flow
will increase this afternoon.

A frontal system moved across Western Washington this morning with
increasing onshore flow this afternoon following the front. Post-
frontal showers will be around this afternoon into Tuesday. A mix of
VFR/MVFR cigs for most this morning around Western Washington, with
localized LIFR/IFR as well. Cigs will slowly improve to low-end VFR
for most interior sites this afternoon, with lingering MVFR cigs
along the coast. Cigs will then fall again towards MVFR Tuesday
morning. Breezy S/SW winds through today, with localized gusts of 15
to 25 kts.

KSEA...MVFR cigs through this morning are expected to improve to VFR
generally between 19-20z and remain VFR into tonight. Cigs may lower
into MVFR again late tonight into Tuesday morning. SE winds will
become SW around 17z. Winds will increase late morning, with gusts
of 20 to 25 kts at times through this afternoon. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
