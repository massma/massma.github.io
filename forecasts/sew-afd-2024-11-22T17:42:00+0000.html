Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
942 AM PST Fri Nov 22 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper-low continues to churn off the PNW coast
through the start of next week with active weather. A
strengthening surface low (not as intense as the one Tuesday)
will brush across the region today with widespread precipitation
and gusty winds. Conditions will settle towards the middle of
next week as guidance hints at the return higher heights.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The east winds in the Cascade Foothills/eastside suburbs
and Western Whatcom County have diminished below wind advisory
criteria - have ended the advisory early. The focus turns to
increasingly gusty southerly winds this afternoon for much of the
region. The advisory continues for the Pacific Coast, and the
advisory has now been expanded to include western Whatcom,
Admiralty Inlet area, San Juan County and Western Skagit County
from noon until 4 am Saturday (gusts up to 50 mph). Areas not
under any wind advisories will still see gusty southerly winds
this afternoon, but only at 35 to 40 mph. Showers also continue
for areas east of Puget Sound. Isolated thunderstorms have popped
up over the coastal waters, and there is the potential for a
couple of them moving along the coast late this morning and
afternoon.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A sub 990 mb surface low is
deepening over the NE PAC. It`s spreading precipitation ahead of
an occluded front from south to north across the region as it
parallels the PNW coastline. Here locally, we`ll see rain persist
through the early morning hours before breaking into showers by
midday. Can`t rule out a slight chance (15%) of thunderstorms,
primarily along the coast this afternoon. Accompanying rainfall, a
tightening pressure gradient will bring another round of gusty
winds as a Wind Advisory is in effect for the coast, western
Whatcom, and Cascade foothills adjacent to gaps. Gusts upwards of
45 to 55 mph are in the forecast. HREF guidance is hinting at a
40% chance for easterly gap wind gusts nearing 60 mph for a few
hours this morning as well. Although not the most likely scenario
it is within the realm of possibility. Wrap-around showers are to
remain in the forecast tonight as the low center gradually ushers
away towards Vancouver Island. Overnight lows are to bottom into
the 40s. Additionally, a high surf advisory will be in effect
Friday for waves of 20 to 24 feet.

Showers are to remain in the weekend forecast (with snow showers
for the mountains) due in part to the upper-low churning
offshore. Again, can`t rule out a rumble of thunder or two
occuring over the coastal waters/WA coastline. Temperatures are to
remain fairly seasonal with highs near 50 F and overnight lows in
the 40s.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Models continue to hint at
the upper level low moving inland by Tuesday. With the low
expected to depart off and eastward, it appears the wet weather
will be replaced with drier weather come midweek as ridging builds
offshore allowing dry northerly flow into the PNW, just in time
for the Thanksgiving holiday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southerly flow aloft with strong low pressure off the
coast, turning more southwesterly this evening as said low shifts
northward. Surface winds remain easterly for some locations however
a shift to more southerly direction underway at the time of this
writing /927 AM PST/ and should see this become the dominant
direction for most of W WA by this afternoon. Speeds remain
generally 10 to 15 kts with gusts up to 25 kts still possible.
During transition from east to southerly, speeds may ease briefly
/an hour or two/ before speeding up again to aforementioned values.

Mixed cigs due to combination of frontal passage and post-frontal
showers. VFR conditions mainly along the Sound, but also present at
HQM. Locations in and near showers likely to see cigs dip into MVFR
or IFR conditions at least through early afternoon. Gradual
improvement expected throughout the day with widespread low-end VFR
conditions expected in the early afternoon. Some additional slight
improvement possible through the remainder of the afternoon and
early evening, but abundant low-level moisture will allow cigs to
fall this evening and tonight. While most locations should still
remain VFR, locations more prone to lower cigs will likely see
conditions erode down into MVFR to IFR tonight and into early
Saturday morning. Instability over the coastal waters may allow for
a slight chance for thunderstorms this afternoon along the coast,
but little to no expectation for impacts to coastal terminals.

KSEA...VFR conditions in place and likely to remain that way for the
TAF period, although showers may allow for brief periods of low-end
VFR to high-end MVFR cigs. Some improvement possible throughout the
day and into the evening, however plenty of low-level moisture will
result in lower cigs overnight and into early Saturday morning.
Although lower...cigs expected to remain just above or right at VFR
thresholds. Light southerly winds will increase in speed by 19Z with
speeds generally 10-15 kts and gusts up to 25 kts for much of the
afternoon and early evening. Wind speeds will gradually lower
tonight down to 5-10 kts after 03Z, but will remain southerly.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A deep surface low will track north off the coast today
with storm force winds over the coastal waters and seas building
over 20 ft. Easterly gales through the Strait of Juan de Fuca
turning more southeasterly this afternoon. Winds will ease and seas
will subside this weekend as the low weakens over the offshore
waters. 33/18<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...The Skokomish River will stay in action today,
before climbing up into minor flood stage tonight.

For the remainder of the rivers no flooding is expected at this
time. Lower snow levels into the weekend in the Cascades will
limit runoff and reduce any flooding chances for rivers flowing
off the Cascades. Precipitation for the remainder of the period
will come in bursts. This combined with snow levels remaining
relatively low will keep rivers in their banks.
