Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
232 PM PDT Sun Jul 6 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Western Washington will see a warming trend as a ridge
of high pressure dominates into Tuesday. A weak system will bring
a brief cool down and a chance of light showers midweek before
high pressure rebuilds for the latter part of the week leading to
a return of warmer temperatures and dry conditions.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge of
high pressure will continue to strengthen and move over Western
Washington through Monday. This will lead to continued clear skies
and a warming trend. Temperatures will be several degrees above
seasonal averages. The Seattle metro area southward has a
moderate HeatRisk on Tuesday, affecting heat-sensitive
individuals. Ensemble guidance indicates that a weak trough
crossing British Columbia will have some influence on Western
Washington Tuesday night into Wednesday. This will promote
increased cool onshore flow and a chance for light showers,
especially along the coast and in the North Cascades.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Conditions should start to
rebound slightly on Thursday. While some lingering clouds and isolated
light showers are possible, the overall trend will be towards
partly sunny skies and temperatures in the 70s for interior areas.
As the midweek trough moves eastward, upper level ridging is
expected to rebuild over the region by late week. Temperatures
will begin to climb back into the mid 70s to low 80s across the
interior lowlands. Another weak front might brush the area late
next weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly to westerly flow aloft as ridging
gradually builds over western Washington. Onshore flow will
continue in the lower levels. VFR conditions will continue to
persist at all terminals this evening as benign conditions
remain. Marine stratus will hug the coast tonight and into Monday
morning, likely bringing MVFR/IFR conditions to KHQM and
potentially KOLM. Elsewhere, VFR will remain through Monday.
Northerly winds persist around 8 to 12 knots.

KSEA...VFR conditions will continue throughout the TAF period.
N/NE winds 8 to 12 knots throughout the evening will decrease
overnight to 4 to 8 knots and will increase again Monday
afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure currently offshore will remain
there until early this week. Diurnally driven westerly pushes down
the Strait will continue over the next several evenings as lower
pressure remains inland. The westerly push tonight is weaker than
the previous couple of nights and looks to remain above any small
craft criteria. Although, cannot rule out a few rogue gusts of
small craft strength here and there, as it will remain rather
brief.

A brief frontal system will cross the waters Tuesday night into
Wednesday may bring an uptick in wind and seas, but at this time
it does look weak.

Combined seas generally around 4 to 6 feet will stay throughout
the first half of the week. Continuous northerly winds may create
steep seas at times throughout the week.
