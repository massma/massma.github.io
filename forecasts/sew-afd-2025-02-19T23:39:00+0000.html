Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
339 PM PST Wed Feb 19 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Post-frontal showers will continue at times into
tonight, primarily for the Cascades. A brief period of drier
weather for some areas Thursday afternoon into Friday morning. A
warm front will move through late Friday into Saturday for
increasing precipitation. An atmospheric river will be focused on
the Pacific Northwest over the weekend for additional heavier
precipitation, with additional unsettled conditions early next
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showers continue this
afternoon, especially over the Cascades with more westerly flow
aloft. QPF tonight into Thursday morning has come in lighter for
the forecast, especially for the Cascades. Snow showers will
continue at times for the Cascades Passes, resulting in light to
moderate snowfall amounts. Otherwise, only a slight chance to
chance of precipitation exists elsewhere in the lowlands through
Thursday. Breezy south to southwest winds will slowly taper off
tonight, with gusts in the next 12 hours or so ranging 20 to 40
MPH.

After a relatively drier Friday morning, rainfall will spread
across Western Washington later Friday into Friday night
associated with a warm front approaching the area. Snow levels
will rise quickly Friday night into Saturday with the warm front,
with snow levels peaking around 5500 to 7500 feet Saturday
afternoon. During this period from Saturday into Sunday, an
atmospheric river will be aimed at the Pacific Northwest for
periods of heavier lowland rain, beginning Saturday PM. In
addition, southerly winds will increase at times Saturday, with
breezy conditions for some areas. The heavier rain threat then
continues Sunday into Monday, although ensembles are a bit more
uncertain in the timing of any potential breaks in the
precipitation that might exist Saturday night, primarily impacting
any potential for river flooding. Refer to the .HYDROLOGY section
for more information. Otherwise, 24 hour rainfall total amounts
from 12z Sat-12z Sun range up to 1" for the Puget Sound lowlands,
near 1.5" for the coast, and heavier amounts for the Cascades and
Olympics. A Marginal Risk exists on the WPC ERO for Saturday as
well. The warmer pattern will also boost temperatures on Saturday
afternoon into the mid 50s for most areas.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...The atmospheric river
will continue to be aimed at Western Washington on Sunday,
resulting in likely heavier rainfall for the lowlands. Snow levels
during this period will remain high, generally ranging 5000 to
7000 feet. River flooding potential will continue to be monitored.
In addition, southerly winds will again be elevated on Sunday.
ECMWF EFI continues to highlight QPF being anomalous from climo
from 00z Sun to 00z Mon, especially for the central and southern
Cascades. The bulk of the heaviest stratiform precipitation looks
to move through by Monday morning. However, another disturbance
will quickly follow again Monday through Tuesday, likely resulting
in additional heavier rainfall, higher elevation mountain
snowfall, and breezy winds. For those looking for drier weather,
there may be a break in the activity by Wednesday. Temperatures
early next week will fluctuate between the low to mid 50s, with
perhaps upper 50s by midweek. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>South to southwest flow aloft will veer westerly as an
upper level trough and associated frontal system move onshore.
Precipitation will decrease by late afternoon and evening behind the
front, but a moist air mass will remain in place with ceilings
consolidating into mostly MVFR. There may be a brief rise into VFR
early this evening before returning to high-end MVFR. Gusty
southerly surface winds are expected to develop across the interior
by early afternoon and persist through the evening before gradually
easing overnight.

KSEA...Precipitation is expected to diminish after 00Z with ceilings
in the higher range of MVFR persisting into tonight. There may be a
brief rise in ceilings above 3000 ft between around 03-09Z Thursday
before returning to high MVFR. Surface winds E/SE 8 to 12 knots
shifting southerly with the arrival of the front and increasing to
15 to 25 knots at times mid-afternoon through the evening before
gradually easing.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly winds over the coastal waters will slowly taper
off tonight as a low pressure system moves inland over Vancouver
Island. Southerly winds over the interior waters will switch to
west/southwesterly this evening with a push down the Strait of Juan
de Fuca. Gale force gusts remain likely through the East Strait of
Juan de Fuca, with Small Craft Advisories remaining through all
other areas. Winds will ease over the coastal waters early tonight,
with breezy winds lingering through the Strait of Juan de Fuca,
Northern Inland Waters, and portions of central Puget Sound.

High pressure will briefly rebuild over the area on Thursday for a
brief reprieve in the active conditions. A warm front will clip the
northern coastal waters on Thursday, brining another rounds of
breezy southerly winds Thursday night into Friday. The active
pattern continues as several systems move through the area Friday
and through the weekend which will likely necessitating additional
headlines for wind and/or seas across much of the area waters. Gale
force winds may be possible on Saturday.

Seas 10 to 15 ft today and tonight. Dominant periods of around 10
seconds are making for very choppy seas. Seas may briefly subside to
around 8 to 9 ft on Thursday (with dominant period increasing to
around 14-15 sec) before becoming rising again to 12 to 15 ft on
Friday and remaining above 10 ft into next week.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An active pattern will bring a series of frontal
systems across the region at least through this weekend. The
Skokomish River has already reacted quickly to the rainfall over
the last 24 hours and continues to rise this afternoon. We are
monitoring the Skokomish River into tonight due to this rise and
have issued a Flood Watch for Mason County.

Additional moisture then could set the stage for a more
hydrologically notable event this weekend. The potential arrival
of an atmospheric river this weekend into early next week would
have the potential for more widespread river rises.

It is increasingly likely that snow levels will climb into the 6000
ft or higher range this weekend as a mild and moist weather system
takes aim at the region. While some uncertainty remains with respect
to the location of heaviest rainfall and associated amounts, there
remains a high likelihood (greater than 70% chance) of 3 to 4 inches
of rain across the mountains. With around a 40% chance of seeing a
5+ inch total in the favored locations of the Olympics and the
central Cascades.

At current, especially given the lower QPF amounts from recent model
runs, the Skokomish remains the only river forecast to get into
flood stage over this weekend, however as forecasts change, this
will need to be re- evaluated routinely as the new week
approaches.
