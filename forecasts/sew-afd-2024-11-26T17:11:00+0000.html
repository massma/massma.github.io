Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
911 AM PST Tue Nov 26 2024

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Current surface observations show some patchy fog has
developed in the Chehalis Valley but is expected to dissipate
through the morning hours. Radar shows some shower activity
has developed in the Pacific and is moving towards the coast. The
current forecast remains on track and no significant updates are
needed at this time.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>.A low pressure system remains offshore and will
gradually move south and east through Tuesday. This will maintain
some residual showers pivoting through the region today. High
pressure then returns for the next several days bringing a less
active pattern. However, temperatures will begin to trend cooler
into the weekend and shower chances will return.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Some scattered showers
will pivot through the region early this morning in between a low
off the southern Oregon coast and a shortwave dropping south
along coastal British Columbia. Otherwise, relatively light winds
and abundant low level moisture is supporting low stratus and some
areas of fog. Expect these low clouds to continue through around
mid- morning with some continued showers around the region.
However, the transition to high pressure and a less active weather
pattern is then expected for the next several days as the
aforementioned low off the Oregon coast pushes away from the
region. Expect increasingly dry conditions Wednesday and into the
Thanksgiving holiday, but it`s worth noting that a few weak
impulses rounding the ridge may still support some light showers
at times. As a result, have maintained the low PoPs evident in the
NBM guidance, but the associated QPF remains quite light. That
is, even if there are a few showers around at times, these are
likely to have little accumulation. With the building high
pressure, expect to see overnight lows gradually trending cooler
by Thursday.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Looking ahead to the holiday
weekend, ensemble guidance continues to suggest that the dominant
feature will remain a relatively high amplitude across the far
eastern Pacific and extending into the Pacific Northwest. Again,
there is a non-trivial subset of ensemble members that suggest a
few passing disturbances in the flow could round the ridge and at
least bring a few showers to portions of the area. As mentioned in
the short term section, the associated precipitation amounts are
relatively light so while there is some mention of showers through
the weekend, it`s likely that there won`t be a significant round
of precipitation and only perhaps a few light showers at times
into the weekend. Meanwhile, with a shift to a cooler and somewhat
drier flow aloft, expect to see the air mass to cool a bit late
in the week and this weekend. This could bring overnight
temperatures down into the 30s (lower 30s in the coolest spots,
mid 30s for most of the Puget Sound Region) for a few mornings
during this time period. For the start of next week, still strong
agreement in the ensemble guidance suggesting a ridge remaining in
place, though increasing disagreement in just how strong it is
and where the ridge axis remains. 12<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northerly flow aloft with a shortwave impulse over
southern Oregon and a ridge building offshore over the northeast
Pacific.

Ceilings are currently a bit of a mixed bag across western
Washington. Largely VFR conditions through the northern half of the
interior, with MVFR to IFR conditions through the Southwest Interior
and the Olympic Peninsula. Satellite and webcams agree, showing
areas of broken low clouds, but limited to no fog coverage across
the area. Ceilings may bounce around a bit this morning, but
generally expect slowly improving conditions through the rest of
this morning. VFR conditions this afternoon and evening will be
somewhat short-lived as low clouds and patchy fog redevelop late
this evening into tomorrow morning.

Winds this morning are mostly calm to light north/northeasterly.
Winds remain mostly light (5 kt or less) across the area today
before turning to light southerly tonight.

KSEA...MVFR to VFR ceilings at the terminal this morning with
scattered low clouds. Northeasterly winds have begun to ease locally
at the terminal, and should remain around 4 to 6 kt through the rest
of today. Ceilings should continue to improve throughout the day
with mostly high-end MVFR to VFR conditions expected. After VFR
conditions this evening, expect a return to MVFR conditions early
tomorrow morning with chances for some very light rain/drizzle.
Winds will also turn southerly.

.MARINE...High pressure building over the waters today and will
remain in place into the weekend. Small craft advisory winds or seas
not expected through the period. Some long period swell is possible
over the weekend with the weather system well to the west. Seas will
stay between 4 and 7 feet through the period with light northerly to
northwesterly flow.

days with no hydrologically significant precipitation expected.
