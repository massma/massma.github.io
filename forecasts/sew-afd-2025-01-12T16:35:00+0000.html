Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
835 AM PST Sun Jan 12 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A less active pattern in place across Western
Washington for the start of this week. High pressure builds
aloft, maintaining cool and mostly dry conditions. Morning fog
will develop under the strengthening ridge, until a weak
disturbance arrives late Wednesday or Thursday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite, obs and radar all
indicating life under a winter ridge for the most part, with
generally quiet conditions, widespread low clouds and some patchy
fog here and there. Current radar does show a mass of showers over
the Admiralty Inlet area that is creeping southward with the trend
actually holding it together pretty well. Switching to satellite, we
see a line of mid to high clouds stretching in a narrow NNW to SSE
line crossing the Sound. Taking this data together and merging it
with models, this is all likely an indication for forecasted
shortwaves moving southward along the leading edge of the upper
level ridge just off to the west. As the day progresses and the
ridge axis leans into W WA, skies will gradually clear and any light
showers will fizzle out.

As ridging intensifies over the region throughout the start of this
week, the pattern will remain generally dry with a persistent risk
for widespread overnight and early morning patchy fog or, at the
very least, some low stratus. The expectation is that these
conditions will lift and burn off by late morning/early afternoon,
although timing will vary from day to day.

Temps will not vary much during the near term, with daytime highs
generally running in the mid to upper 40s today and Tuesday,
although Monday will be slightly cooler with highs in the lower to
mid 40s. Overnight lows will be quite brisk, dipping to around
freezing and bottoming out in the lower to mid 30s.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...From Previous
Discussion...Expect some increased cloud cover late Wednesday into
Thursday as ensemble guidance continues to support a brief shake-up
in the pattern as the next upper trough slides into south-central
British Columbia. Still some discrepancies in both the depth of this
trough and exactly what path it will take. Unsurprisingly, PoPs
still hold around 20 percent, highest in the north, and the bigger
sensible weather impact for most will be the additional clouds and a
bit more mixing which should bring a brief reprieve from the fog and
any increasingly stagnant air. For the remainder of the week, the
spread in potential scenarios becomes increasingly large owing
primarily to differences in the position and amplitude of the
Pacific ridge - specifically , is it close enough to block the
region from additional disturbances or far enough offshore to leave
the door open. One thing to keep an eye on with future cycles of
guidance in the potential for even colder air to arrive around next
weekend, with the forecast trending a bit cooler late next weekend.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper ridge will continue to be located offshore
through today with an upper low moving southward along the eastern
periphery of the ridge for northerly flow. A wide variety of cigs
this morning across Western Washington. LIFR/IFR primarily from KAWO
southwards across Puget Sound towards OLM. VFR/MVFR elsewhere along
the Olympic Peninsula and northern areas. Areas of some vsby
reduction as well in lower stratus, mainly between 2-4SM. Cigs will
slowly improve between 19-21z and further towards VFR by 00z. Cigs
will lower again overnight to LIFR with potential low vsbys as well
into Monday morning. Cigs may struggle to improve for some areas of
Puget Sound into Monday afternoon due to light flow. Light winds
this morning with a light north wind component later this afternoon.

KSEA...IFR/LIFR cigs this morning with low stratus. Vsbys generally
expected to range between 3-6SM through 19z. Cigs will slowly
improve to MVFR/VFR mid-late in the afternoon. LIFR cigs/vsbys
develop again late tonight into Monday morning. Light, variable
winds this morning with light north winds developing later this
afternoon. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will build over the waters through
Monday. The ridge will remain over the waters through the majority
of the week. A weak front will move across the waters Thursday into
Friday.

Seas 9 or 12 feet over portions of the Outer Coastal Waters through
tonight. Small Craft Advisory extended to include the southern Outer
Coastal Waters with seas building to 10 feet again this evening.
Seas remaining just below 10 feet over the remainder of the inner
coastal waters through Monday. Another round of seas 10 to 12 feet
for the entire coastal waters Thursday with the next front. JD/Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
