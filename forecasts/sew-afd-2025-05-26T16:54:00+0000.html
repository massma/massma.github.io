.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A front will produce cooler temperatures and a few
showers today. High pressure rebuilds over the region Tuesday
and Wednesday with warming temperatures and dry conditions. Another
front on Thursday will cool temperatures briefly, but a return
of warmer and dry conditions is expected to return late in the
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak front and
associated upper trough is spreading a few showers into Western
Washington early this morning. This activity will wind down by
afternoon as the disturbance shifts east of the Cascades. High
temperatures will cool a couple more degrees over yesterday. The
downturn will be brief as upper ridging rebuilds into the area
tonight and Tuesday. Temperatures will bounce back several
degrees as thermally induced low pressure expands northward
along the coast and the low level flow turns weakly offshore.
The thermal trough will shift inland on Wednesday with
temperatures climbing further over the interior. Widespread
highs in the 70s to mid 80s are expected on Wednesday away from
the immediate coast.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The upper ridge
axis moves into the Northern Rockies on Thursday with another
weak front and associated upper trough expected to reach Western
Washington. Much like the current system, this is likely to
only a produce a few showers and briefly cool temperatures.
Upper ridging rebuilds into the area Friday and Saturday for
drier and warmer conditions. Another system may try to reach the
area early next week, but only half or less of the ensembles
manage to generate any precipitation with it. The march toward
summer continues. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
