Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
546 AM EDT Sun May 25 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
Low pressure meanders near the Canadian Maritimes today, with
high pressure attempting to build in from the west. The high
tracks over the region by late Monday as the low exits farther out
to sea. High pressure over the region weakens by the middle of
the week, allowing a series of weak disturbances to potentially
impact the area.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Troughing remains in place over the Northeast today as the
upper low meanders over the Canadian Maritimes. Surface high
pressure over the Great Lakes attempts to build in from the west.

Another mostly clear morning to start the day, before cyclonic
flow and surface heating help to generate widespread cloud cover
by the afternoon. Additional shortwave energy rotating around
the trough thru late day will maintain at least the possibility
for a few rain showers, though coverage appears lower than on
Saturday. Best chance looks to be in the afternoon across the
interior, mainly north and west of NYC, but can`t entirely rule
out isolated showers down to the coast. Pressure gradient a bit
more relaxed than the start of the weekend, and winds will be
lighter as a result.

Temperatures moderate a few degrees from the start of the
weekend, and afternoon highs range from mid 60s to around 70.
Looking ahead, it`s very possible this will be the coolest day
across the region for at least the next week as a warming
pattern set ups into the start of meteorological summer.

Any showers dissipate shortly after sunset and temperatures fall
back once again into the 40s and 50s overnight.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /MONDAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Ridging begins to build in on Memorial Day, as surface high pressure
centered over the Great Lakes noses into the Mid Atlantic.

Expect less in the way of shower activity relative to the rest of
the holiday weekend, with subsidence from the ridge and lack of a
forcing mechanism. Still can`t rule out a spotty pop up late day
shower, especially inland, but not enough at this point to warrant
slight chance PoPs (>15%).

Additional sunshine and a bit deeper mixing on Monday yields
slightly milder conditions, with much of the region away from
the immediate shoreline topping out around 70, or low to mid 70s
in the urban metro and NE NJ. Light flow and dew pts in the 40s
should allow for a comfortable afternoon under a mix of sun and
clouds.

Surface high builds overhead Monday night, and skies attempt to
clear overnight in response. This should set up one more relatively
cool night, falling into the 40s across the interior southern CT and
LoHud Valley, and LI Pine Barrens, with 50s elsewhere.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
High pres builds offshore on Tue, resulting in a return flow off the
ocean. Could be some enhanced sea breeze action late in the day as
the general flow couples with the sea breeze circulations. Dry wx
fcst with shrtwv ridging across the area. Temps modified by the
onshore flow, but close to normal nonetheless for the first time
since the 18th.

An upr low stalled over the upr Midwest will then produce a more
zonal flow across the cwa thru the rest of the week, ushering in a
series of disturbances. This will produce chances for shwrs thru the
period. Any track and timing of the rain is uncertain attm, as the
features will be driven in part by convection from the plains to the
Southeast. The latest GFS is actually quite dry for most of the
week, but stuck with the NBM with the blended approach deemed the
best for now.

There is a chance for a more organized low and widespread rainfall
for the weekend, but uncertainty is high this far out despite a 40
pop from the NBM.

&&

.AVIATION /10Z SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
Low pressure will continue to slowly track over the Canadian
Maritimes today. High pres begins to build in tngt.

VFR. WNW winds around 10 kt early this mrng. Winds WNW-NW today
increase to 10-15 kt with gusts around 20 kt. Winds decrease
aft 23Z and remain light thru Mon mrng.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

No unscheduled amendments expected.

.OUTLOOK FOR 06Z MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...

Tonight: VFR.

Monday-Tuesday: VFR.

Wednesday-Thursday: MVFR possible. Chance of showers.

Detailed information, including hourly TAF wind component forecasts,
can be found at: https:/www.weather.gov/zny/n90

&&

.MARINE...
Northwest winds gust up to around 20 kt thru today, and should
prevail below Small Craft Advisory (SCA) criteria. Occasional 25 kt
gusts are possible however, particularly along the near shore waters
thru this afternoon.

Flow lightens tonight as high pressure builds in, and
conditions remain sub SCA thru Memorial Day with winds under 10
kt, and seas at or below 3 ft across all coastal waters.

Winds and seas then look to remain blw sca lvls Tue-Wed with
high pres weakening over the waters. Seas on the ocean may build
to sca lvls for the rest of the week as a series of weak sys
potentially impact the waters.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
No hydrologic impacts expected through the week.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
There is potential for localized minor coastal flooding tngt into
early next week. A new moon will occur Monday evening, causing areas
to need as little as 1/4 ft of tidal departure for minor coastal
flooding. The models are suggesting water lvls may touch minor along
the wrn CT coast tngt, where high tide is around 11 pm. Because it
is so mrgnl, will hold off on a statement for now.

There is a moderate rip current risk today as winds and seas gradually
subside. Highest threat in the morning and early afternoon, with a
residual easterly swell around 2 ft with 8 sec period. Ocean seas
will have a general downward trend during the day.

Rip current risk reduces to low for Memorial Day, as swells continue
to subside.
