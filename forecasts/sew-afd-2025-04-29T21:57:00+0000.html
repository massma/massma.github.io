Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
257 PM PDT Tue Apr 29 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will build into the region through
Thursday, bringing a return to drier and warmer weather. The next
chance for showers will enter the region Friday, with unsettled
conditions favored through the remainder of the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light post-frontal
convergence zone showers and patchy fog will persist through the
afternoon over King and Snohomish Counties before activity tapers
off this evening with dry and cloudy conditions elsewhere. Highs
today across western Washington are on track to peak in the 50s
and low 60s.

A high pressure ridge will continue to amplify into the Pacific
Northwest into Wednesday, with dry and mostly sunny conditions
returning once the morning low stratus layer burns off.
Temperatures will peak in the upper 50s along the coast and in the
60s further inland.

High pressure will continue to build over western Washington on
Thursday, with steadily increasing temperatures and clear skies.
Highs will peak in the upper 60s along the coast, with
temperatures in the upper 70s across the interior. Some areas
along the Cascade foothills and valleys may reach the low 80s. The
lowlands will be warm enough for widespread Minor (Yellow)
HeatRisk.

The upper ridge axis will shift eastward on Friday as a trough
approaches the coast. Southerly flow aloft will keep warm
temperatures in place east of the Puget Sound, with Minor HeatRisk
continued for these areas. A frontal system and associated band of
rainfall will approach the Pacific Coast by mid-afternoon Friday,
spreading inland late Friday into Saturday morning. Forecast
models continue to trend this system slower, and it may arrive
closer to Saturday morning.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The trough will split
apart as it moves inland on Saturday, resulting in light rainfall
amounts across western Washington. Split flow will develop over
the region through the rest of the weekend, with lingering light
shower activity possible. While operational models show a ridge
developing overhead by the end of the weekend, ensembles maintain
a chance of showers across the region into early next week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A shortwave trough has pushed this morning`s frontal
system east of the Cascades this afternoon. There remains post
frontal convergence showers in northern King/Snohomish Counties.
MVFR ceilings continue in Puget Sound/Cascades, and pockets of the
coast and Strait of Juan de Fuca this afternoon, where cloud
coverage is thicker. Some mist down to 3 SM is still being observed
with the showers. Outside of these areas, partial clearing has taken
place with a few pockets of sun, and CIGs improving to VFR. The CIGs
have been slower to climb (compared to guidance), which has been
reflected in TAFs going into the afternoon (some Puget Sound
terminals may struggle to reach VFR until the convergence zone
dissipates around 01-04Z. Regardless, a good marine push will bring
more MVFR region-wide Wednesday morning (IFR/LIFR in Kitsap area),
with complete clearing expected after 18-21Z Wednesday. Winds post-
front have turned more west-northwest in most areas at 5 to 10 kt
(few gusts observed up to 20 kt along the coasts). They will
decrease to 5 kt tonight (becoming variable in some spots), before
increasing to 4 to 8 kt from the north Wednesday.

KSEA...Post-frontal convergence zone continues to produce showers in
and near terminals - expected to continue through 01-04Z this
evening. CIGs remain MVFR, with expectation for improvement to lower-
end VFR as soon as 01Z Wednesday. Additional MVFR CIGs are expected
early through late Wednesday morning, with clearing taking place
after 18-21Z. Winds WNW at 5 to 10 kt this afternoon will become
northerly next few hours into the evening, becoming less than 5 kt
tonight out of the NE, and N at 4 to 8 kt by 18Z Wednesday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A trough went through the waters earlier this morning with
a frontal system. The flow will become more onshore with west to
northwest winds post-front. There is a strong push going through the
central and east sections of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, with gusts
up to 27 kt observed at nearby Port Angeles. The small craft
advisory continues in these areas through Wednesday morning. Weather
will clear out as a ridge builds off the coast Wednesday into
Friday, with a trough passing through next weekend. The threat for
any hazardous winds is low at this time with this trough.

Seas currently are 6 to 7 feet at 9 with periods at 9 seconds - will
drop to 4 to 5 feet Wednesday and Thursday, and increase to 6 to 8
feet next weekend with the trough moving through, decreasing back to
5 to 6 feet next week Monday.
