Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
942 AM PST Wed Feb 5 2025

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Snow showers will continue to stream northward into
western Washington today as a low pressure system churns offshore.
Latest radar echoes show heavier snow showers slowly moving north of
the WA/OR border, which will provide our next round of showers as
the day goes on. Snow will spread northward over the region
throughout the late morning and into the afternoon, though warming
temperatures may allow for a rain snow mix at times and for some of
the snow on the ground to melt. Snow showers will continue into the
overnight hours, and paired with colder temperatures, prepare for
another round of icy and slick road conditions Thursday morning. A
Winter Weather Advisory remains in effect across much of the
lowlands through Thursday morning. No major updates to the forecast
this morning but will continue to closely monitor as conditions
evolve.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...An upper level low spinning across the Pacific
Northwest will continue to bring chances of snow showers to
western Washington through Thursday before pushing inland on
Friday. A weak system moving across the area over the weekend
will keep conditions showery across western Washington. Cold,
below normal temperatures will persist across the area into early
next week.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low will
continue to circulate offshore today and Thursday before pushing
inland on Friday. This will continue to bring chances of snow
showers to western Washington through at least Thursday.

The attention then turns to the increasing potential of more
widespread accumulating snowfall this afternoon into early
Thursday as the upper level low offshore moves eastward and pushes
more moisture into the area. HREF guidance pinpoints the next
round of snow showers starting to move north into western
Washington starting later this morning and into the afternoon.
While it`s tough to pinpoint exactly where the heaviest snowfall
will occur, this next round has the potential to bring more
widespread accumulating snowfall to areas across the interior,
especially from Olympia to Arlington, than what we have seen over
the last several days. While uncertainty in exact snow amounts
still exists, the latest NBM probabilities indicate roughly a
40-60 percent chance of at least 1 inch of snow falling for areas
from Chehalis to Everett. Percentages drop at 2 inches, with much
of the I-5 corridor showing a 25 to 40 percent chance of snow
amounts reaching 2 inches or greater. The most likely scenario in
regards to snow amounts for the interior lowlands at this time is
roughly half an inch to 1 inch, though locally higher snow amounts
will be possible in any heavier precipitation or banding that
develops. The other complicating factor will be just how quickly
temperatures fall to freezing tonight - with the most likely
period for accumulating snowfall remaining late tonight into early
Thursday. Snow will taper areawide Thursday morning as the upper
low offshore sinks southward towards OR and northern CA and pulls
the available moisture with it and out of the area.

A brief, somewhat drier period is expected to commence across
western Washington Thursday afternoon as the upper low continues
to sink southward out of the area. Clearing skies on Thursday will
bring significant cooling to western Washington Thursday night,
with morning lows on Friday expected to dip down into the low to
mid 20s areawide. A few spots may even see lows drop down into
the teens. Chances of snow showers increase again Friday afternoon
and evening as the upper low pushes inland over northern CA and
pushes some wrap-around moisture back up into western Washington.
Most of the moisture looks to remain situated across the southern
two- thirds of the CWA, with additional snow amounts Friday night
into Saturday generally looking to be anywhere from a trace to
half an inch across portions of the area at this time.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Guidance continues to
trend showery over the weekend as a shortwave drops down into
western Washington from the north on Saturday. Western Washington
then looks to remain under more of a troughing influence heading
into early next week, keeping overall temperatures cooler and the
potential for showers in the forecast. While a spread in the
temperature forecast remains, expect temperatures to remain below
normal through much of the long term. Highs generally look to
top out in the mid 30s to near 40 with overnight lows looking to
trend in the 20s to low 30s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly to southerly flow aloft as an upper
level low continues to churn offshore. Scattered snow showers across
western Washington this morning for a mix of MVFR/IFR conditions
across area terminals. Could see even LIFR, briefly, in heavier snow
showers with decreased visibilities 1-3SM. Out of showers,
conditions relatively will persist at VFR otherwise. Another band of
precipitation will push through the Puget Sound terminals generally
around 18z-22z which will bring another round of snow showers with
occasional conditions lowered to MVFR/IFR, perhaps even lower
briefly in snow and fog.

Gusty Fraser Outflow winds continue to affect KBLI early this
morning, but will gradually decrease into the early part of the
afternoon with northeast winds 8 to 12 knots. Elsewhere, can
expect northeasterly winds 5 to 10 knots this afternoon
switching more southerly into this evening.

KSEA...Scattered light snow showers continue to move across the
terminal this morning. Expect to see MVFR ceilings as snow showers
pass through the terminal; otherwise expecting VFR conditions. An
additional band of snow showers will near the terminal around 17z-
21z for a likely decrease in conditions and visibilities ranging
from MVFR/IFR. These showers may initially start as rain/snow mix,
but will settle into snow near 00z. Latest hi-res guidance shows
these scattered showers continuing through 03z-05z where MVFR will
continue.

N/NE wind this morning around 8 to 12 knots may switch southerly
briefly this morning (13z-17z), before turning more easterly around
19z-21z ranging from 4 to 8 knots, then settling into a southerly
direction after 00z. Latest hi-res guidance is struggling on the
exact timings of wind shifts, but it is due to the aforementioned
band of snow showers and exact placement.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface trough will continue to remain over the
coastal waters with surface ridging in place over British
Columbia. Fraser River outflow winds have weakened over area
waters and any Small Craft Advisories for the inland waters have
been allowed to expire. Light offshore flow will continue through
most of the water zones into the end of the week.

Combined seas around 3 to 6 feet will continue into next week.
