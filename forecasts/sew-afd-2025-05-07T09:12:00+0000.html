Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
212 AM PDT Wed May 7 2025

.SYNOPSIS... <span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak frontal system will cross the region today
with scattered shower activity and much cooler temperatures. Drier
and mild conditions will return through the remainder of the week
with another frontal system on track to bring unsettled conditions
over the weekend into early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A few showers have reached
the coast early this morning ahead of a weak frontal system that
will shift onshore later today with minimal QPF. Temperatures will
take a tumble today with most areas 10 to 15 degrees cooler than
yesterday. Onshore flow increases further behind the front late
today. This should be enough to get a meager convergence zone
going, but it will be short-lived. Onshore flow relaxes and
heights rebound somewhat on Thursday for some sunshine by
afternoon, but temperatures will be held back to around seasonal
norms. Upper ridging is still on track to rebuild somewhat on
Friday for a modest increase in high temperatures and dry
conditions.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The upper ridge weakens
and shifts eastward on Saturday as broad upper troughing deepens
just offshore. Much of the interior should escape with a mostly
dry day, but increasing cloud cover will likely hold temperatures
down a couple degrees or more over those of Friday. By early
Sunday, another weak front is slated to move onshore with another
round of showers for the region. Broad upper troughing takes up
residence along the coast early next week. There are some model
differences with the track of the upper low. While this may affect
the QPF forecast, confidence is high that temperatures will run a
little below normal with a continued threat of showers through
the early part of next week. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>VFR conditions expected through most of the TAF period
for most area terminals, with the exception of the Pacific coast.
Increasing clouds this evening ahead of an incoming frontal system
today. Very light rain is expected as the front comes through this
morning, not having much in the way of impacts to interior
terminals. A steadier band of rain may drop the cigs to MVFR at
times for interior locations. Coastal terminals may see periods of
MVFR to IFR. Surface winds will pick up out of the southwest at 8 to
15 kts with gusts to 20 kt possible later this morning, with gusts
likely to be the strongest through the Strait of Juan de Fuca this
afternoon and evening at 25 to 30 kts. Post frontal convergence zone
showers expected this evening in the vicinity of KPAE and well north
of KSEA.

KSEA...VFR through most of the TAF period. A frontal system is
approaching and will introduce shower chances throughout the late
morning and early afternoon hours. Light rain is expected, but may
occasionally drop the cigs to MVFR. Southwesterly surface winds to
increase today at 8 to 12 kts with gusts up to 20 kt possible.
Convergence zone activity this evening should remain north of the
terminal.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A front and associated precipitation is moving onshore
early this morning. Seas are presently hovering at around 5 to 6 ft,
but will increase throughout the day to 7 to 8 ft. A westerly push
through the Strait of Juan de Fuca remains at small craft advisory
strength beginning late this morning where gusts could reach 25 kts.

High pressure rebuilds late this week, but a return to unsettled
conditions are expected into next week.
