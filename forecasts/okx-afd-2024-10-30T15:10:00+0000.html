Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
1110 AM EDT Wed Oct 30 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
As a warm front lifts north and east of the region, high pressure
remains centered just off the East Coast through Thursday. A
cold front approaches from the west Thursday night, moving across
the region on Friday, followed by high pressure for the weekend.
A frontal boundary may impact the region early next week.

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Morning fog has lifted, with sunny skies expected through early
afternoon. Sunshine will be filtered thereafter through high
clouds as they work into our area through the afternoon.

As the warm front lifts north and east of the area, a modest SW
flow will develop behind it, and this will help advect in a
much warmer air mass compared to the start of the week. H5
climbs to nearly 590dm as deep ridging amplifies over the
region, or nearly +2 STD. Soundings prog 925 mb temperatures
around 18C locally, which should yield low to mid 70s for much
of the region this afternoon, or 10 to 15 degrees above normal.

Temperatures remain mild overnight once again, with lows mainly
in the 50s, or near 60 around NYC.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/...
The warmth continues to close the month on Thursday. Ridge axis
shifts east of the region as a shortwave pushes through the
northern Great Lakes. An associated cold front begins to approach
from the west late in the day, but sprawling surface high
pressure centered off the Carolina coast remains in control
during the day.

The subsidence inversion weakens across the area and should allow
a bit deeper mixing relative to Wednesday, nudging afternoon
highs up several degrees. Away from the immediate shoreline,
temperatures climb into the 70s, and perhaps even lower 80s in
NE NJ and the LoHud Valley. Given these expected values, up to
20 degrees above normal, this appears to be one of the warmest
Halloweens on record for the region, with daily records in
jeopardy at several sites. See the Climate section farther down
for additional detail.

Cloud cover begins to thicken and lower Thursday night ahead of
the approaching cold front, and not entirely out of the question
far western areas see rain showers move in early Friday morning.
The trend in guidance has been slower and drier, and it`s also
possible that the frontal passage occurs dry for at least parts
of the region, or is delayed until later Friday.

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
Stuck somewhat close to the NBM through the long term with no
significant changes in the forecast.

A cold front will continue to move across the region during the day
Friday, with just some chance POPS. Some of the newer 00z forecast
guidance is even hinting that the front may come through dry in some
locations. Will continue to cap POPs at chance (25-40%).

Behind the front, high pressure builds back into the region for the
weekend and most likely into early next week. Expect dry conditions
for the weekend. Another frontal boundary may approaches early next
week, which could result in some slight chance POPs early next week.
Confidence at this time remains low.

Temperatures will remain at or above seasonable levels through the
long term period.

&&

.AVIATION /15Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
High pressure builds over the region today.

VFR through the TAF period.

SW winds today 8-10kt with occasional gusts to around 15kt. SW
flow continues thru Tue, with speeds generally aob 10kt. Higher
speeds along with some gusts possible along the coast.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB)TAF Uncertainty...

Some variability in direction possible thru 16Z. Occasional
gusts to around 15kt possible today.

OUTLOOK FOR 12Z THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...

Thursday: VFR. SW wind gusts 15-20 kt.

Friday: Mainly FR. Chance of MVFR and showers. W wind gusts around
25kt, bcmg NW and diminishing at night.

Saturday and Sunday: VFR.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Conditions are expected to remain below advisory criteria on
all waters through tonight and much of the day Thursday.

Increasing SW flow Thursday ahead of a cold front will bring a
return to SCA conditions to at least the ocean waters Thursday
evening. Wind gusts up to 30 kt, and seas between 5 and 7 ft can
be expected. SCA conditions continue into Friday, especially on
the ocean. Winds weaken and seas subside Friday night as high
pressure builds over the northeast. This will lead to sub-SCA
conditions for the upcoming weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
The next couple of days expect minimum RH values 45 to 55 percent
with SW winds 10 to 15 mph.

A Special Weather Statement remains in place today for southern
Connecticut to highlight existing fires and the continued risk
of spread.
