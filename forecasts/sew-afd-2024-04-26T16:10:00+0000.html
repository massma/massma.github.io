Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
910 AM PDT Fri Apr 26 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Additional frontal systems will impact the region
through the weekend and into early next week. A trend toward
somewhat drier conditions and temperatures closer to normal is
expected for the later half of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Scattered showers
continuing over the region this morning will diminish in coverage
later today as upper trough axis gradually shifts east of the
region. Most areas will see a brief drying spell tonight before next
system poised offshore moves into the area during the day on
Saturday. No forecast updates are anticipated this morning. Previous
discussion follows with updates to marine and aviation portions. 27

Current surface analysis showers a surface cold/occluded front over
Forks draping into the Southwest Interior and into Oregon. An upper
level trough sits directly overhead western Washington for Friday as
it moves onshore. A surface low is also centered off the coast in
the Pacific. The overall stacking of this system indicates weakening
as it comes onto land and is slowed down. Radar imagery shows a
couple pockets of showers/rain continuing in the Cascades and
Olympics this morning, with isolated showers south of Olympia moving
north. Some of the moisture is wrapping around the low in the
Pacific, aided by southwest/west flow aloft keeping the air at least
somewhat moist before dry air aloft intrudes in behind the trough. A
couple smaller shortwave troughs will still pass over the region
Saturday and Sunday.

Long story short, precipitation chances will continue through the
weekend. Although not an all day washout, multiple rounds of
showers will be possible for the remainder of Friday, Saturday,
and Sunday. Convection is not anticipated, but the cool air
aloft/warmer surface temperatures may support a graupel shower. The
heaviest precipitation from yesterday`s system has mostly
concluded, and many areas received anywhere from a half of an inch
of QPF to near 2 inches. For the remainder of Friday, lowland
areas may see a couple more tenths of an inch of QPF, with close
to a half an inch possible in the Cascades/Olympics. Same amounts
are expected for Saturday. For Sunday, heavier precipitation may
set up over the Cascades, increasing QPF totals to around an inch
(potentially just over). Friday will be the warmest day in the
short term with highs around 60. This drops into the mid 50s
Saturday and Sunday, well below average. Winds remain light out of
the south/west at 5 to 10 miles per hour, but a few gusty winds
are possible near waterways.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Additional systems are
expected to impact the region next week. The wettest day at this
time appears to be Monday, with a strong mid-latitude cyclone/jet
streak dropping down from Canada. Some models have hinted
convection with this system on Monday, although activity is
expected to remain showery and isolated in nature. After
Wednesday, there remains disagreement into how strong an
additional trough will dig down the west coast. Some models have
it staying in Canada, while others have it dropping into northern
California. A couple more ensembles members (compared to
yesterday) are even showing some ridging over the Pacific
Northwest Thursday. Monday/Tuesday remain cool in the 50s, but
could see 60s make a return next Wednesday/Thursday. Winds will
remain light as well in the forecast.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light southwest flow aloft with light south-
southwesterly flow at low levels = except northerly flow at the
northern Puget Sound terminals after 23Z today. MVFR CIGs will
generally trend towards VFR levels this morning, areas/terminals
with lingering showers will be slower to improve. MVFR CIGs along
the coast will likely hang in there longer into the afternoon before
overall improvement there. Widespread CIGs are likely to dip back to
MVFR levels early Saturday AM.

KSEA...CIGs have improved at the terminal and will continue to trend
that way through the afternoon and evening. Scattered showers into
the afternoon may result in brief periods of MVFR conditions - 2500
to 3000 ft CIGs and 3-5 sm VSBYs. VFR conditions tonight will trend
back to MVFR around 7/8Z as ceilings lower to 2500 to 3000 ft, with
improvement as the marine layer lifts Saturday AM. South to
southwest winds 4 to 8 kt.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...Surface low pressure continues to weaken as it moves
further inland this morning. No headlines currently in effect with
marginal northerly wind gusts to near 20 kt possible over the far
offshore waters through early this evening. The next frontal system
is poised to move over the area waters Saturday, as a warm front
lifts across the waters, turning flow to the southwest with advisory-
level wind gusts likely over the offshore waters late Saturday
morning into the afternoon (80-90% chance).

Additional frontal systems will cross the area waters through next
week as an active weather pattern continues.

Seas ranging from 5 to 7 feet, rising to 6 to 9 feet later this
afternoon and closer to 10 feet into Saturday night and Sunday,
lingering around 8t 10 feet through early next week.
