.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No changes made to this evening`s update. The previous
discussion remains below along with an updated marine/aviation
section.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough will swing across the Pacific
Northwest tonight and Sunday. Upper level troughing will then remain
the dominant influence over the region through much of the next
week, bringing increased onshore flow, cooler temperatures, and some
showers at times.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Smoke aloft continues to
stream into western Washington from the south, producing hazy skies
across much of the region this afternoon. Latest satellite imagery
shows some mid to high cloud cover also moving in from the south,
associated with some very weak echoes on radar. The airmass remains
dry in the low levels, so do not expect to see much in the way of
precipitation to make it to the ground. A slight chance of isolated
thunderstorms remains for portions of the south Sound and Cascades
through tonight, though latest probabilistic guidance still shows
less than a 10 percent probability of occurrence - so confidence in
this remains low.

The thickness of the smoke aloft has been impacting temperatures
across the region this afternoon. Current temperatures are trending
in the 70s across the interior and the 80s across the Cascades. With
smoke continuing to stream in overhead, have lowered afternoon highs
a few degrees and have them generally topping out in the low 80s for
the interior lowlands. Warmer conditions are still expected for the
Cascades, with temperatures expected to top out in the upper 80s to
low 90s in some spots.

An upper level trough moving into Oregon today will swing its axis
across the Pacific Northwest on Sunday, bringing increased onshore
flow and slightly cooler temperatures to western Washington. Stratus
will push a little bit further inland along the coast on Sunday
morning where afternoon temperatures are generally on track to top
out in the mid to upper 60s. Temperatures across the interior will
start to cool a few degrees as well, topping out in the upper 70s to
low 80s. Elevated smoke aloft will continue to stream into the
region on Sunday, however expect slow improvement through the day. A
chance of showers and isolated thunderstorms remains possible for
the Cascades on Sunday afternoon, however confidence in occurrence
again remains low.

Flow aloft will transition to more zonal on Monday, promoting
increased onshore flow and allowing for stratus to push further
inland into the interior. Temperatures will cool as a result with
afternoon highs expected to be in the 60s and 70s. Cooler conditions
will continue into Tuesday, before an upper level trough approaches
the region Tuesday afternoon and evening.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Guidance generally
hints at upper level troughing remaining the dominant influence
across the region through much of the long term period. The
aforementioned upper trough digging offshore on Tuesday looks to
swing across the region on Wednesday and bring more widespread
shower activity back to western Washington. The trough looks to move
off to the east by Thursday afternoon, allowing for conditions
across western Washington to briefly dry back out. Guidance then
hints at another trough deepening over the northeastern Pacific and
approaching the area over the weekend. The overall pattern will keep
temperatures trending close to just below normal through much of the
extended period. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak upper level trough moving through Western
Washington Sunday. Southerly flow aloft becoming southwesterly
late Sunday morning and westerly later Sunday. The change in the
flow aloft will push the elevated smoke east of the area Sunday
night. Onshore flow in the lower levels increasing Sunday.

IFR ceilings along the coast tonight with the stratus spreading
inland Sunday morning reaching the Puget Sound area 12z-14z.
Ceilings improving slowly later Sunday morning. Skies clearing
over the interior 19z-21z with MVFR ceilings continuing along the
coast.

KSEA...Elevated smoke aloft through Sunday. IFR ceilings
developing 12z-14z. Ceilings lifting to MVFR by late morning with
the clouds scattering out 19z-21z. Southwest winds 4 to 8 knots.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Thermally induced trough inland tonight with low level
onshore flow. Onshore flow strengthening Sunday with small craft
advisory westerly winds in the Central and Eastern Strait of Juan
de Fuca Sunday evening. A weak front cross the waters on Monday.
Weak low pressure moves through the Coastal Waters Tuesday and
Wednesday. Wave Heights generally 4 to 7 feet through the period.

.FIRE WEATHER... Hot, dry, and unstable conditions will continue
through this evening for the Olympic zones 652/661 and Cascade
zones 658/659 - where a Red Flag Warning remains in effect.
Elevated smoke and some mid to high cloud cover moving into the
region from the south has aided portions of the southern Cascades
from bottoming out into critical RH levels this afternoon,
however latest observations are still showing RHs in the low to
mid 20s across portions of the North Cascades. Isolated thunderstorms
will remain possible across portions of the South Cascades through
this evening, though confidence in this remains low with probabilistic
guidance still only showing less than a 10% chance of occurrence.

Cooler and more moist air will make a return area-wide on Sunday,
though isolated thunderstorms will again be possible across the
Cascades Sunday afternoon into evening as an upper trough swings
through. General upper troughing pattern setting up next week will
bring increased onshore flow and cloud cover, better humidity
recoveries, and the potential of some wetting rains by mid-week -
which will help mitigate fire weather conditions. 14
