Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
348 AM PST Fri Jan 3 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A pair of weather systems will move through Western
Washington in the next couple of days. The first one will move
through this afternoon. The second one Saturday evening. Each
system will bring lowland rain, higher elevation mountain snow and
locally breezy conditions. A third system will move inland south
of the area Sunday night into Monday morning. An upper level
ridge will build over the area later Monday with the ridge
remaining in place through the middle of next week. The ridge
might not be strong enough to prevent weak systems from brushing
the area.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows warm
front over Western Oregon early this morning. Leading edge of the
rain associated with the front near Chehalis at 11z/3 am.
Temperatures were mostly near 40.

Warm front lifting north today moving through Western Washington
this afternoon. Rain spreading north reaching the Canadian border
by 17z/9 am. As the front moves through rain coming to an end
over the southern portion of the area this afternoon. Easterly
gradients across the Cascades will continue to drop this morning
bottoming out around -10 mb giving the Cascades foothills some
breezy conditions into the early afternoon hours. While the free
air snow level will be between 3500 and 4000 feet the the North
and Central Cascades and 5500 feet in the Southern Cascades
easterly winds through the passes will create a shallow layer of
sub freezing air right near the surface. Will have a chance of
freezing rain in the passes. Highs in the mid 40s to lower 50s.

Upper level trough moving through tonight into early Saturday
morning keeping showers in the forecast. Rain out ahead of the
next front reaching the coast Saturday morning spreading inland
during the day. Parent low with this feature well to the north
so not expecting round of breezy easterly winds in the foothills.
Snow levels lowering slightly but neither one of these systems
will be big snow producers in the Cascades.

Front moving through Saturday evening. Little in the way of cold
air behind the front keeping post frontal shower activity at a
minimum later Saturday night into Sunday.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...System moving inland south
of the area Sunday night and Monday morning with a chance of rain
mainly from Seattle south. Operational runs in good agreement
with an upper level ridge building later Monday. Ridge remaining
over Western Washington into Thursday. The GFS ensembles are in
line with the operational run with only a couple of ensemble
solutions indicating some light precipitation Monday night through
Thursday. The ECMWF operational run has a warm front trying to go
over the top of the ridge Wednesday into Thursday. About a third
of the ECMWF ensemble solutions have the warm front bringing some
light precipitation into the area. Will at least go dry Tuesday
with areas of morning fog due to the low level moisture and light
surface gradients and keep chance pops in the forecast for
Wednesday and Thursday. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft this morning will shift more
southerly this afternoon as an upper level low approaches the area.
North to northwesterly flow is expected tonight. Surface winds
mostly east to northeasterly ranging 5 to 10 kts, although some
locations reporting above /HQM 10-15 kts/ and below /BFI, PAE, CLM
and OLM 5 kts or less/. For the majority of terminals, winds will
increase here in the morning hours, getting to 10-15 kts with some
gusts up to 20-ish possible as frontal system continues eastward. As
winds shift more east to southeasterly, speeds should diminish back
into the 5-10 kts range. HQM may see speeds a touch faster, 8-12
kts, but nothing that strays too far from that.

Cigs largely VFR at the time of this writing /2 AM PST/, however
there are some spots of MVFR conditions, mainly in the south Sound
area. MVFR to LIFR conditions are being met along the Strait. As
frontal system moves through the area, expected cigs to become more
widespread MVFR with increasing chances for precip. Said precip may
bring cigs down into IFR mainly for those locations already prone to
lower cigs...but it is possible that brief period of IFR may emerge
elsewhere, depending on precip rates. Gradual improvement of cigs
this afternoon as front slowly exits...with most terminals improving
to VFR conditions by late this afternoon/early this evening. The
abundant low-level moisture looks to drag cigs down during the
overnight hours tonight into early Saturday morning, giving rise to
a return to widespread MVFR conditions.

KSEA...VFR conditions hanging on as system approaches the area.
Models the past couple of days have not really had a good handle on
when cigs expected to dip, so much of the morning will consist of
eyeballing the forecast, basing it more on obs and trends than
models. Current data does not feel like it has a good handle on
things, some models being too agressive, some too lax. Will likely
split the middle here, leaning toward MVFR conditions emerging in
the 14-16Z time frame, with a preference toward the latter half of
that window. If that is the case, will likely push back recovery to
VFR conditions...but the end of precip will herald improving cigs,
likely within the 00-02Z time frame. Above wind discussion applies.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An approaching warm front/cold front combo passing through
area waters throughout the day today will keep winds and seas
active. As such, inherited SCAs for coastal waters and the western
two-thirds of the Strait will remain in place. Timing for the Strait
remains solid, so no alteration there...running from this morning
through to the late afternoon/early evening. The alternating of
weather factors, first seas, then winds, then seas again, has
warranted an extension of the inherited SCA for the coastal waters,
and with latest forecasts suggesting winds picking up again Saturday
night, further extensions might be warranted. It is also worth
noting during the initial wind increase, some gusts up to 35 kts are
possible. While these speeds would slightly pass gale criteria, do
not believe these gusts will be frequent enough to upgrade current
headline at this time. This, of course, will need to be monitored.

As already mentioned, seas remaining 10-12 ft this afternoon and
evening even as winds ease only to increase again Saturday
afternoon, again ranging 10-12 ft, before easing again Saturday
night. Forecast for the remainder of the weekend and the start of
next week has them returning to the 7-9 ft range.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A pair of weather systems will move across western
Washington through the weekend bringing additional precipitation
to the region. Each of these systems will be fairly progressive,
which will limit the total rainfall accumulation with each system.
Snow levels will start out between 5000 to 6000 feet on Friday
and drop to 3500 to 4500 feet Saturday and Sunday. The heaviest
rainfall amounts are expected over the southern Olympics, where 2
to 4 inches of rain are expected Friday through Sunday. This could
be enough to push the Skokomish River over flood stage late
Saturday or Sunday. Rises on the remaining rivers are expected as
well, but no river flooding is forecast.

Drier weather pattern setting up beginning Monday which will allow
all the rivers, including the Skokomish to recede. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
