Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
351 AM PDT Mon Aug 26 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge over the area weakening today. Upper
level trough and associated front moving through late
tonight/early Tuesday morning. High pressure building back in
Tuesday afternoon and Tuesday night. Upper level ridge over
Western Washington Wednesday into Saturday with the ridge
moving east Sunday. Upper level off the Northern California
coast beginning to move northeast Sunday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
middle and high level clouds out ahead of an approaching system
over the far northern portion of the area early this morning.
Mostly clear skies over the remainder of Western Washington. Fog
starting to form over the Southwest Interior with visibility at
Olympia at 3 am/10z 1/2 of a mile. Temperatures were in the 50s.

Increasing middle and high level clouds over the area today as an
upper level trough and associated front approach from the
northwest. Front near Haida Gwaii early this morning. The front
will still be northwest of the area late this afternoon. Chance of
rain in the afternoon northwest of a line from Bellingham to
Hoquiam. Even with the increasing clouds highs in the mid 60s to
mid 70s.

Upper level trough moving through late tonight/early Tuesday
morning. Narrow front associated with the trough will bring a
brief round ( 2 or 3 hours ) of rain from the Puget Sound
northward. Winds increasing with and behind the front especially
near the Strait of Juan de Fuca and over the Northwest Interior.
Lows tonight in the 50s.

Not much of a cool pool of air behind the front so post frontal
showers will come to an end pretty quickly Tuesday morning.
Convergence zone developing between Seattle and Everett with
showers lingering a little longer in this area. Northerly flow
aloft developing Tuesday afternoon will help decrease the cloud
cover. Highs Tuesday below normal, mostly in the 60s.

Upper level ridge building over Western Washington Tuesday night
and Wednesday. 500 mb heights in the mid 580 dms by 00z Thursday.
Northwesterly surface gradients will knock a couple of degrees off
the highs especially near the water. Wednesday morning will be the
coolest morning in a while. Another touch of fall with lows in the
mid 40s to mid 50s. The last time Seattle had a low below 50
degrees was over two months ago ( 49 degrees June 19th ). Highs in
the upper 60s to mid 70s.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Upper level ridge remaining
over Western Washington through Saturday. Low level flow going
weakly offshore later Thursday into Friday with a thermally
induced surface trough along the coast. Upper level ridge
starting to drift east Saturday with the low level flow turning
onshore late in the day. Possibly problematic upper level low off
the Northern California coast starting to move northeast Sunday.
Models hinting at some convection over the Oregon Cascades Sunday
afternoon. Will be keeping an eye on how the feature evolves this
week. For now the upper level ridge continuing to move east
Sunday with increasing low level onshore flow cooling high
temperatures 5 to 10 degrees. Highs Thursday 70s to lower 80s,
Friday and Saturday mid 70s to mid 80s and Sunday upper 60s and
70s. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft will increase across Western
Washington today ahead of a frontal system and trailing upper level
trough that will move across the region late tonight.  Aside from
patchy LIFR/IFR in stratus this morning, VFR conditions are expected
with increasing high and mid level moisture. MVFR ceilings in light
rain will develop along the coast this afternoon then spread to the
interior lowlands by late this evening. Gusty post-frontal surface
winds are expected late tonight through much of Tuesday morning.

KSEA...Increasing high/mid level clouds today with ceilings lowering
to MVFR in light rain near or after 06Z tonight. Surface winds light
and variable early becoming southwesterly 5 to 10 knots late this
morning through the afternoon. Winds will become gusty behind the
front late tonight.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system will reach the coastal waters this
evening then sweep inland overnight tonight. Post-frontal onshore
flow behind the system will lead to small craft advisory conditions
across the coastal waters in the form of gusty northwest winds and
choppy short period seas. Additionally, westerlies will increase
through the strait with gusts potentially approaching gale force
briefly early Tuesday morning near the east entrance. Surface
ridging strongly rebuilds offshore for the second half of the week
while lower pressure remains in place over the interior for a return
to a more seasonal pattern of varying degrees of diurnally driven
onshore flow.

.CLIMATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>With the forecast temperatures the remainder of the
month there is a good chance August 2024 will be the coldest
August in Seattle since 2011.

The chances for a 90 degree plus day in Seattle really drop off
this time of year. Out of the 267 90 degree plus days since
records started at Seattle-Tacoma airport in 1945 only 24 (9%) of
them have occurred on August 26th or later. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
