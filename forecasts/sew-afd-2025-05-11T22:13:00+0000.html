Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
313 PM PDT Sun May 11 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system will cross over western Washington
resulting in widespread showers today. Lingering moisture with the
parent upper low will keep scattered showers in the forecast for
Monday. Upper level ridging will start to build into the area
midweek for the return of warm and dry conditions. Active weather
is possible later the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Recent radar imagery
shows scattered shower cover pushing from the south with a weak
front crossing the area. An upper level low spinning offshore is
aiding in shower development across the area this afternoon.
Latest hi- resolution guidance is depicting shower coverage
generally moving northward across the area into the evening. There
is a chance of convective showers through this evening, where a
rumble of thunder and perhaps a lightning strike or two cannot be
ruled out. Model guidance is seeing very minimal instability
values, so the chance of thunder and lightning is low, but it is
there. Temperatures this afternoon mainly hovering in the low to
mid 60s.

The aforementioned upper level low will continue to drift
southward and bring some wrap around moisture into Monday, keeping
showers in the forecast. Weak upper level ridging looks to build
into Tuesday and will be the primary influence on the weather
through Wednesday, keeping the area mostly dry but a few showers
are still possible in the higher terrains such as the Cascades
during that time. Temperatures largely remaining the same.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Ensembles are hinting at
more upper level troughing in the long term period, which would
bring more unsettled and showery weather into the weekend.
Deterministic models seem to be split on the strength of multiple
frontal systems at this time, but overall consensus looks like
more troughiness and showery weather through the long term.
