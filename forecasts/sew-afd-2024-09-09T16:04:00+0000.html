Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
904 AM PDT Mon Sep 9 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Cooler and wetter conditions will return to western
Washington this week as a series of systems cross the region.
Onshore flow will maintain below-normal temperatures and cloudy
skies with a few rounds of showers through the week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The overall forecast
remains on track this morning, with no updates needed. The
previous discussion follows below, with updates made to the
aviation section. 14

Zonal flow aloft and increased onshore flow this morning is
bringing in a stronger marine push, with low stratus overspreading
much of western Washington. While ceilings will improve
throughout the late morning and into the afternoon, skies will
stay cloudy through the rest of the day. Temperatures today will
peak in the mid 60s to mid 70s, which will be the warmest day for
the remainder of the week.

Temperatures Tuesday will fall a few degrees as a trough deepens
along western Canada. Onshore flow will continue, with another
morning marine push and cloudy skies throughout the day with the
lowlands seeing highs near the 70 degree mark.

Forecast models have slowed down the progression of the next
incoming system, with the next chance of showers spreading inland
late Tuesday evening into Wednesday. A cutoff low will swiftly
track inland across the Pacific Northwest throughout the day on
Wednesday, sliding a cold front across the region that will lower
temperatures into the 60s. Ensembles have increased rainfall
amounts with this system, with roughly a quarter of an inch for
most lowland areas and upwards of half an inch across Grays Harbor
County and over the mountains. Mount Rainier will also see a few
inches of snow accumulation over its highest peaks as more fall-
like conditions return to the region.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Light shower activity will
linger over the Cascades and foothills early Thursday as the
trough exits to the east. Conditions will briefly dry out
throughout the day Thursday ahead of the next incoming trough
that will pass over the region throughout the weekend. Periods of
light shower activity will continue through Sunday, with below-
normal temperatures and cloudy skies persisting.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft becoming southwesterly later today
as a weak trough moves into the area. Low level onshore flow
continuing.

Stratus is now embedded throughout most of Puget Sound with
widespread ceilings of 1000 to 2000 feet. Similarly to yesterday,
it will take time to scatter out. Most terminals should expect
more scattered clouds by 21Z-22Z. Additionally, after the
disturbance clears the area this afternoon, winds are expected to
turn back around to the northwest after 23Z. Speeds will generally
be 7 kts or less.

KSEA...MVFR cigs currently impacting the terminal as stratus
continues to impact the area. The stratus is expected to linger over
the terminal through 21Z-22Z as the onshore flow pattern favors a
prolonged presence of the lower clouds. Winds are southwesterly
and will continue throughout much of the afternoon at 5 to 8
knots. Between 23Z and 02Z, winds will switch back to the
northwest at 5 to 7 kts.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>After today`s disturbance clears the region, the pressure
gradients are expected to flatten out, diminishing the chances
through midweek for any advisory level winds through the Strait of
Juan de Fuca and other area waters. Seas are benign at 4 to 7 feet
through the period. Stratus will continue to impact Puget Sound and
the inner coastal waters throughout much of the day today, which
could limit visibilities, particularly during the morning hours of
13Z through 17Z.
