Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
357 AM PDT Sun May 12 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge over the area moving east this
afternoon. Weak upper level trough moving through tonight with a
weak upper level disturbance following Monday. Upper level ridge
building Tuesday and remaining in place through Friday. Upper
level trough reaching the area Saturday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows weak
upper level ridge over the area. Stratus along the Oregon coast
has not made it to the Washington coast as of 10z/3 am.
Temperatures were mostly in the upper 40s and 50s.

Upper level ridge moving east today. Light surface gradients this
morning turning onshore this afternoon. Marine air moving into the
area will drop high temperatures 10 to 15 degrees versus Saturday.

Upper level ridge well to the east tonight with low level onshore
flow continuing overnight. Weak upper level trough moving across
Western Washington. Not much moisture associated with this
feature. It will enhance the marine layer over the area. Weak
convergence over Snohomish and possibly Northern King County could
produce a light shower. Lows in the upper 40s to mid 50s.

Upper level ridge building well offshore Monday. Weak shortwave
embedded in the northwesterly flow aloft moving through bringing
just some cloud cover. This plus the stratus associated with the
marine push will make for a mostly cloudy day. Cooling trend
continues with highs only in the upper 50s to mid 60s.

Upper level ridge offshore building into Western Washington Monday
night into Tuesday. Surface gradients going northwesterly Monday
night which will limit the amount of stratus Tuesday morning. With
the warming temperatures aloft high temperatures will warm back up
above normal, in the 60s and lower 70s. Lows Monday night in the
40s.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Models starting to show
more consistency in the extended period with the upper level ridge
over the area Wednesday slowly weakening through Friday. Upper
level trough dropping down from the north Saturday. Surface
gradients remain onshore keeping temperatures from getting very
warm. Warmest day with the upper level ridge the strongest
Wednesday. Highs in the mid 60s to mid 70s. Highs slowly cooling
down to the 60s by Friday. Lows in the 40s. Upper trough bringing
more cloud cover and a chance of showers to the Cascades Saturday.
Highs remaining near normal, in the 60s. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft will back to southwesterly
tonight as an upper ridge gives way to a weak upper trough and
associated front that will cross the region late tonight into early
Monday. Increasing low level onshore flow associated with this will
bring IFR or low MVFR stratus to the coast by this evening. VFR
conditions across the interior of Western Washington today are
expected to deteriorate to MVFR by early Monday A.M.


KSEA...VFR with increasing high level moisture expected late this
afternoon into the evening. Ceilings expected to fall to the low end
of MVFR by 12Z-15Z Monday. Surface winds light and variable becoming
W/NW 5 to 10 knots midday then N/NE late afternoon and early
evening. Winds expected to back to S/SW after 06Z tonight.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Broad surface ridging offshore with lower pressure inland
will remain the general synoptic situation through much of the week
ahead leading to varying degrees of onshore flow. A pair of weak
systems passing mainly to the north of the area tonight and Monday
will enhance the onshore flow for gales later today in the
central/east strait and small craft advisory conditions for adjacent
waters as well as the coastal waters. Onshore gradients look to
temporarily weaken midweek before additional weak systems increase
the onshore flow again later in the week. All in all, this looks
very much like a typical late spring/early summer type of pattern.
