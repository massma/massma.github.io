Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
741 AM EDT Sat Apr 5 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A warm front pushes in early today, then stalls over/near the
area until a cold front pushes in Sunday morning. The cold front
stall nearby to the south Sunday afternoon. A wave of low
pressure tracks through along the stalled boundary Sunday night
and exits east Monday. A secondary cold front moves through late
Monday night into early Tuesday. High pressure builds for mid
week before pushing offshore Thursday. A frontal system may
approach late on Friday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
A weak low pressure system in the Ohio River Valley tracks into
southern Ontario today into early tonight before exiting into
northeast Canada early Sunday. This low pressure system brings a
warm front through the area this morning into this afternoon. The
warm front is expected to stall over the area or just to the north.

The warm front will lead to increased moisture and a source of lift
for showers throughout the day. Most of these showers will occur
mid/late morning into early evening, tracking mainly west to east
and are expected to be scattered to numerous in coverage.

As the stalled front lingers, another round of showers are expected
Sunday night. 00Z CAMs are in agreement, introducing increased
instability late this evening into tonight. Some thunderstorms are
possible. Given the enhanced nature of thunderstorms and available
moisture, could see a brief moderate to heavy downpour, but not
expecting any flooding issues given the quick progression of the
system. Total QPF today into tonight looks to be around 0.5", but
could see isolated higher totals closer to 1-1.5" in any
thunderstorms tonight.

00Z CAMs also agree on fog advecting in over Long Island and
possibly into coastal locations along the LI Sound and NJ coast
tonight.

High temperatures today should reach the low-50s in the afternoon,
with lows tonight not too far off in the low to upper-40s.

&&

.SHORT TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front will push in Sunday morning ending most shower
activity in the morning and clearing out the fog. It appears
most available guidance agree on the cold front being weak and
stalling nearby, over the area or just to the south. This means
isolated to spotty showers are still possible on Sunday.

A wave of low pressure will track along the stalled front and
over the region Sunday night. Showers will be numerous to
widespread with this system aided by PWATs peaking around 1.75",
positive vorticity advection from a deepening longwave trough
over the Great Lakes, and being located within the upper-level
divergent right entrance region of a jet streak to our north.
Temperatures should be warm enough for mainly liquid precip, but
its possible some snow could mix in in the far interior late
Sunday night into early Monday morning, if temperatures are able
to drop low enough.

This wave of low pressure will exit Monday morning. Isolated to
spotty showers may still occur on Monday, but not much rain is
expected as we lay between, but far enough away, a developing
surface low along a shortwave to the south and another surface
low to the northwest embedded at the base of a longwave trough.

Temperatures on Sunday should warm to the mid/upper-50s prior
to the cold front. Sunday night will be cold with lows in the
low-40s to low-30s. Monday follows suit with highs in the
mid/upper-40s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A secondary cold front moving through late Monday night into
early Tuesday will usher in a cold airmass for the middle of the
week, with temperatures 5 to 10 degrees below normal Tuesday
through Wednesday night. Temperatures return to more seasonal
levels for Thursday and Friday. The coldest night will be
Tuesday night with freezing temperatures expected across the
region, which has trended slightly colder since Friday.
Frost/freeze headlines will be possible for Tuesday night with
the growing season having begun in the New York City metro area.
There will be a chance of showers with the passage of the cold
front Monday night into Tuesday, and then much of the week will
be dry as high pressure builds in, and moves offshore late
Thursday. Mainly followed the deterministic NBM guidance, except
for winds and gusts Tuesday, going toward the 75th percentile
as gusty west to northwest winds are likely during the day with
strong cold advection. The next chance of precipitation will be
late next week into the weekend as a frontal system may impact
the region as an upper and surface low approach. A blocking
pattern sets up with the trough over the east coast, and the
upper low closing off, and unsettled weather may remain through
next weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /12Z SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A warm front approaches from the south through today, slowing
its northward movement, and possible becoming nearly stationary
in the vicinity tonight.

VFR this morning with intermittent light rain showers.
Conditions may begin to lower to MVFR by late morning with rain,
however, more likely during the afternoon, lowering to IFR by
mid afternoon. LIFR by this evening and continuing into tonight
with rain continuing.

Winds E/SE around 15 kt, with gusts 20-25 kt. Gusts have become
more frequent and included in the forecast. The SE/E winds
diminish late afternoon, and likely become light and variable at
all the terminals this evening. Low confidence in the wind
direction and speeds especially by late afternoon into tonight
and will depend on the timing and placement of the warm front.


 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Low confidence on the timing of lowering conditions this
morning into the evening, and could be several hours off from
TAF as conditions and timing will be dependent on the warm
front. Expect LIFR early this evening into the overnight. There
is a chance of LIFR .


.OUTLOOK FOR 12Z SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...

Sunday: IFR/LIFR with light rain and fog across Long Island and
southeastern Connecticut early, then improving to VFR. For the
NYC metro terminals and west, IFR is possible until around 13Z,
then becoming VFR. Winds NW gusts around 20 kt during the day.
MVFR to IFR returns Sunday night at all the terminals, with
rain showers.

Monday: Rain showers mainly early with MVFR possible. Otherwise
mainly VFR.

Tuesday: VFR. A slight chance of rain showers in the morning for the
terminals east of New York City. W-NW wind gusts near 20-25 kt.

Wednesday: VFR.

.MARINE...
Winds may exceed 25 kt on ocean waters mid-morning today into this
evening from a passing warm front. A SCA is in place on ocean waters
for this. Winds tonight will be below SCA criteria, but waves may
not be. Waves will build to 5 ft on ocean waters, but will last
longer on eastern ocean waters into tonight. SCAs are timed for
this.

Sunday into Monday, SCA criteria will not be met on most waters
except ocean waters where 5 ft waves remain a possibility.

Ocean seas remain elevated at SCA levels Monday night with the non
ocean waters below advisory. Then during the day Tuesday northwest
wind gusts increase to SCA levels across the forecast waters in the
wake of a secondary cold front. Winds and seas remain at SCA levels
into Tuesday evening, and then begin to subside west to east as high
pressure builds into the waters, falling below advisory levels on
the non ocean waters by late Tuesday night. Ocean seas east of
Moriches Inlet may remain at SCA levels into Wednesday morning. Sub
advisory conditions return by midday Wednesday, and remain below
into Thursday.
