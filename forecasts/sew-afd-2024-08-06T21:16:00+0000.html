Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
216 PM PDT Tue Aug 6 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Stratus in place this afternoon but slowly breaking up
this afternoon. Temperatures will return to above normal, peaking
on Thursday. East flow over the Cascades may filter in some haze
Thursday and Friday. Thunderstorm potential increases over the
Cascades later this week. Troughing may develop early next week
for slightly cooler temperatures.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Widespread stratus remains
in place across much of western Washington this afternoon thanks
to robust onshore flow associated with a passing upper level
trough moving through today. Stratus is beginning to dissipate in
the Cascade valleys, and will continue to retreat westward
through this afternoon. This cloud cover will help moderate
temperatures across the region, with highs today only reaching the
60s to low 70s. Stratus should clear over the Puget Sound
lowlands by this evening. Overnight lows tonight in the 50s with
stratus remaining in place through the Olympic Peninsula and
redeveloping through parts of the interior.

Tomorrow will be much warmer compared to today with ridging back
in place, with the stratus burning off in the morning with mostly
clear skies. Highs will rebound back into the 70s along the
coast, with low to mid 80s through the interior.

Thursday looks to be the warmest day in the forecast, with highs
in 80s to low 90s, with 70s to low 80s along the coast. Low
temperatures will also be fairly warm, in the low to mid 60s. Not
much change in the expected HeatRisk forecast, with widespread
Orange/Moderate with pockets of Red/Major in the Cascade Valleys
and the southern Seattle metro area. Additionally, the 850 and 925
mb winds will turn easterly. Winds at surface will primarily be
northerly through the lowlands but look to turn easterly over the
Cascade crest and through the mountains. Near-surface smoke and
haze from fires in British Columbia and Eastern Washington will
likely be pushed over the crest and may filter down through some
of the Cascade valleys, particularly over the north including
Skagit and Whatcom counties.

A trough looks retrograde from the Canadian Prairies towards
southern BC and Alberta Thursday into Friday, bringing cooler air
aloft towards western Washington. This will create some elevated
instability, which will allow chances for showers and
thunderstorms to develop each afternoon over the Cascades.
Currently the best chances currently look to be Friday afternoon
and into Saturday afternoon, confidence will increase once we get
closer to the hi-res model window. See the Fire Weather discussion
for additional details. It will also begin to usher the start of
a cooling trend, with highs on Friday a touch cooler than
Thursday, topping out in the mid to upper 80s.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...A series of waves will
allow upper-level troughing to be the dominant pattern this
weekend and into the beginning of next week. Temperatures look to
return back to around normal, in the 70s to low 80s, with lows in
the 50s. There will also be continued slight chances for some
isolated showers and thunderstorms in the North Cascades, but
probabilities decrease after Saturday. Flow in the low levels will
also return to westerly, which will help filter out any smoke and
haze that makes it over the Cascade crest. Otherwise dry
conditions are expected to continue this weekend into early next
week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mainly MVFR/IFR in widespread low stratus. Cloud cover
will continue to slowly break up throughout the afternoon with
inland terminals returning to VFR by this evening. Another weaker
marine push will bring low stratus inland early Wednesday morning,
though conditions are not favored to deteriorate as much as this
morning. Winds generally W/SW 10 kt or less will turn northerly by
the early morning.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings will continue to hold on and break up by mid
afternoon. VFR conditions with scattered cloud cover with another
weaker marine push early Wednesday morning. W/SW winds 6 to 10 kt
shifting N/NW Wednesday morning.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A persistent pattern will continue across the region
through early next week with broad high pressure offshore and lower
pressure inland. Diurnally driven westerly winds through the Strait
of Juan de Fuca will continue, with Small Craft Advisory winds
expected this evening at least in the central strait and nearest to
the international boundary. Onshore flow will weaken later Wednesday
into late week. Persistent northwest winds will continue over the
outer coastal waters, maintaining steep seas generally around 4 to 6
feet.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridging will begin to build into the
area starting on Wednesday bringing warmer temperatures and drier
conditions through the rest of the week. Onshore flow will
fluctuate throughout the week with generally good RH recoveries
each night.

The main concern for fire weather starts Thursday evening into
Friday as a weak disturbance clips the Canadian border, with
increasing instability, which may trigger some thunderstorm
development along the North Cascades. The particular area we are
monitoring is mainly the northern portion of zone 658 near the
Canadian border. Latest guidance suggests a potential for isolated
thunderstorm chances each afternoon and evening through the
weekend, although Friday looks like the best chance (20-35%) for
thunderstorm development. Even though RH values will not near
critical thresholds, lightning strikes outside of any storm can
spark new fires.
