Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
850 PM PST Wed Jan 29 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Dry conditions continue into early Thursday morning. A
frontal system will bring lowland rain and heavier mountain snow
Thursday night through Friday. An upper low sliding southwards
across British Columbia will usher in a cooler pattern, along
with the potential for lowland snow for some areas, Saturday into
early next week.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The forecast remains
on track this evening. Stratus along the coast continues to push
down the Strait tonight and fill into portions of the central and
northern Sound. Areas of patchy fog will also be possible across
the interior overnight. Low temperatures will mainly be in the
upper 20s to mid 30s across much of western Washington. With no
updates needed to the forecast, the remainder of the previous
discussion follows below. 14

The upper ridge that has been situated over the Pacific Northwest
will flatten Thursday ahead of the next frontal system. During
this period, clouds will increase into Thursday morning. Precipitation
will then spread inland along the Olympic Peninsula Thursday
afternoon and further eastward into Thursday night. Lowland rain
is expected through Friday, with heavier mountain snowfall. Snow
levels will initially begin around 2500 feet Thursday evening
before rising to 4000 to 4500 feet Friday afternoon, and then fall
again Friday night below Pass level. Current snowfall forecast
has amounts near 2 feet for Stevens and White Passes through
Saturday evening, with lower amounts between 12 to 18 inches for
Snoqualmie Pass due to a mix with rain Friday afternoon. For this
reason, a Winter Storm Watch has been issued for the Cascades,
mainly above 3000 feet. If you`re traveling over the Passes later
Thursday through the weekend, continue to monitor the forecast and
check with WSDOT for road information.

Snow levels will then fall rapidly Saturday as a deep upper low
along the British Columbia coast slides southwards towards Western
Washington. During this period, precipitation becomes more
convective, with heavier showers at times, and potential
convergence zone activity in the vicinity of Snohomish County.
850mb temperatures are expected to range between -6 and -8C by
Saturday, with cooler surface temperatures. Dependent on precip
rates, this may allow for rain/snow mix in the heaviest showers on
Saturday, allowing for brief snow accumulations in isolated areas.
24 hour probabilities (through Saturday PM) from the NBM of 1" of
snow generally ranges from 10 to 30% from Seattle southward, with
slightly higher probabilities north of Everett, likely due to
convergence banding. The best chance for light snow accumulations
on Saturday (over one inch) remains in the Cascade Valleys due to
slightly higher elevation, as well as along the northwest Olympic
Peninsula, where probabilities range 50 to 90%. Of note however,
we will get a better idea of the location of convective bands, and
temperatures, as more hi resolution guidance becomes available.
Otherwise, Fraser Outflow winds are forecast to develop later
Sunday, which further increases confidence that any snowfall will
be more rate dependent Saturday. High temperatures will peak this
week on Friday in the upper 40s to low 50s, with temperatures
falling by Saturday to near 40 for highs.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Ensembles have slowly
become a bit better in agreement in the position of the upper low
offshore of Vancouver Island by Sunday. Although slight
differences remain, especially in the eastward extent of the upper
low track (GEFS closer to PacNW, EPS a bit more offshore) which
impacts smaller scale differences at the surface. This is
noticeable on 850 mb temperatures with GEFS significantly cooler
than the EPS/GEPS counterparts, as well as the timing of Fraser
Outflow developing impacting surface temperatures by later Sunday
into Monday. With that said, temperatures will continue to slowly
cool Sunday and Monday, and given the continued existence of
showers around at times, a rain/snow mix or snow showers are a
likelihood for Western Washington. During this period, the highest
QPF amounts are forecast along the Olympic Peninsula and over the
Cascades. These are the regions highlighted on ECMWF EFI for
snowfall, particularly the NW portion of the Olympic Peninsula, as
well as areas of western Whatcom County, highlighting regions
anomalous to climatology on the EPS. NBM probabilities are also
elevated in these areas, specifically western Clallam and
Jefferson Counties along the west slopes of the Olympics, where
probs of 4" range 70 to 90%, with similar values for the Cascade
Valleys (in a 48 hour period ending Monday afternoon).
Probabilities remain lower for portions of central Puget Sound due
to lighter QPF at this time. However, we will have to continue to
monitor adjustments over the next few days as higher resolution
guidance becomes more available, as the upper low continues to
linger over Western Washington or is located just offshore
allowing for additional rounds of moisture. In summary, it will
be important to continue to monitor the forecasts through early
next week to due the potential lowland snowfall.

Uncertainty also remains in regards to the upper low position
Tuesday into Wednesday, but ensembles keep the low offshore. For
this reason, continued rounds of precipitation are possible, with
current probabilities of precip ranging 30 to 60% during this
period for most of Western Washington. Given the temperature
profile, snow or rain/snow mix will be likely at times with any
precipitation. Of further note, temperatures continue to become
colder early next week on ensembles, with GEFS remaining the
coldest solution for most areas. There remains a rather large
spread in temps by the middle of next, for example, the coldest
ensemble member for BLI next Tuesday morning is 5 degrees, with
the warmest being 35 degrees, and nearly a 15 degree spread in the
25 to 75th PCT for Tuesday AM temps. Will have to monitor a
longer duration period of cold temperatures especially during the
mid-week timeframe, along with lower apparent temperatures due to
Fraser Outflow across Western Whatcom County and across the San
Juan Islands. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>VFR across the majority of the terminals, with the
exception of the coastal terminals. Current satellite shows cloud
cover lingering along the coast and filtering in from the west ahead
of an incoming weather system, set to arrive Thursday night. Expect
cloud coverage to become more widespread and ceilings to lower this
overnight towards MVFR. Terminals near the Kitsap Peninsula are
expected to trend down to IFR/LIFR. Guidance hints at some terminals
potentially lowering down to IFR/LIFR during the morning hours (20%-
30% chance).Light rain will begin to move in late Thursday evening
along the coastal terminals. Southwesterly flow with winds, 3 to 6
knots.

.KSEA...Currently VFR, but ceilings are expected to trend downwards
toward MVFR with increasing cloud cover Wednesday night ahead of an
incoming weather system. MVFR conditions are expected to persist
through Thursday night. Rain chances will increase across the
terminal after 21Z on Thursday, bringing light rain. Southwesterly
flow with winds 4 to 6 knots.

.MARINE...High pressure today will continue to bring calm conditions
over the waters. Two frontal systems are expected to move over the
waters: one Thursday night into Friday and one on Saturday. These
systems will bring winds approaching small craft criteria winds to
the coastal waters, Strait of Juan de Fuca, and inland waters
through Saturday.

Combined seas will be 3 to 5 ft through Thursday night. Seas will
gradually build throughout the day on Friday up to 10 to 13 ft, and
remain elevated through Saturday. Waves will start to decrease
throughout the day on Sunday below 10 ft and remain at 5 to 7 ft
through early next week.

.HYDROLOGY...No river flooding is expected over the next 7 days
as abnormally dry conditions continue. However, with the
precipitation coming towards the end of the week, the Skokomish
River is forecast to rise above Action Stage. There will be much
uncertainty with the river forecast all the way into the event
given the current below normal flows and the snow and ice build up
in the basin over this recent dry but cold period. As far as
other rivers, only low elevation basins like the Chehalis, Samish,
and Stillaguamish Rivers will see much response at all.
