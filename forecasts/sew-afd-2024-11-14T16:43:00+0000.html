Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
843 AM PST Thu Nov 14 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Showery and cool conditions will persist across
western Washington today before an upper ridge brings a brief
break in the active weather to the area on Friday. Cool and
unsettled conditions will return over the weekend and persist into
early next week as another system moves into western Washington.
Upper level ridging developing along the West Coast may bring
drier conditions and warming temperatures to the area around
midweek.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The current forecast
remains on track with no updates this morning. Scattered showers
will continue across western Washington today as an upper level
trough axis gradually makes its way onshore tonight into early
Friday. Additional rainfall amounts of up to a quarter of an inch
are possible for the interior lowlands and roughly a quarter of an
inch to half an inch are possible in showers along the coast.
With snow levels continuing to lower towards 3000-4000 feet
throughout the day, expect snow to continue for the mountains. The
North Cascades could see an additional 1-2 inches of liquid
through the day for continued snow at higher elevations. Stevens
Pass may pick up an additional 1-3 inches through this evening.

In addition to lowland rain and mountain snow, another round of
coastal flooding will be possible along the Pacific coast due to
minor tidal overflow around high tide this morning. This may lead
to the flooding of shorelines and low-lying coastal areas. The
potential for coastal flooding looks to continue over the next few
days and will gradually extend to the inner coast.

A brief break in the weather is expected on Friday as the upper
trough axis pushes off to the east and upper level ridging nudges into
the region. A few lingering showers may persist across the
Cascades through the day on Friday for light snow accumulations,
but generally expect to see a drier trend across the area. With a
saturated atmosphere in the low levels, will likely see some fog
development across the interior early Friday morning.

The next system will then move into the region on Saturday,
bringing another round of widespread precipitation and breezy
winds to the western Washington. Snow levels will rise between
5000-7000 ft through the day as a warm front approaches the area
and ushers in some more moisture. Snow levels will start out at
3000-4500 feet across the Cascades, initially allowing for snow
to pick up during the afternoon and evening hours.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...The aforementioned system
will keep conditions wet and unsettled through much of the
weekend. A cold front will move across the region on Sunday,
allowing for snow levels to plummet towards 2000-3000 feet
throughout the day. Snow will pick up across the mountains and
may be heavy at times, with accumulating snow expected for the
Cascade passes. Wet and unsettled conditions will continue into
early next week, with shower activity expected to persist into
Tuesday.

Ensemble and deterministic guidance have started to come into
better alignment and show a strong signal of an upper level ridge
building along the West Coast near midweek. While uncertainty
remains in its strength, this would primarily shift the storm
track to the north of the area and would promote drier and warmer
conditions for western Washington heading into the second half of
the week. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough remains over the Washington
coastal waters with southwesterly flow aloft over the region. The
air mass will remain somewhat unstable today with scattered showers
and isolated thunderstorms. Ceilings will be primarily VFR except in
and around some of the heavier showers. Shower activity will
decrease this evening with ceilings solidifying into a high end MVFR
layer across much of the interior of Western Washington by early
Friday morning. Gusty south to southwesterly surface winds will
gradually ease through the day.

KSEA...MVFR currently but, VFR should rebound today by 18-19z except
in and around any heavier passing showers. Shower activity will
dissipate by late this evening and ceilings are expected to lower to
around 025-030 after 09Z then persist into much of Friday A.M.
Surface winds south/southwesterly 10 to 15 knots with a few higher
gusts possible through midday. Winds ease this evening and will
remain light southerly tonight.  27/McMillian<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface trough over the coastal waters has shift
inland this morning. Light onshore flow will prevail tonight into
Friday as surface ridging rebuilds over the coastal and offshore
waters. The ridge will shift inland on Friday night and another
front will approach the waters on Saturday. This front is expected
to generate another round of headlines for all waters. Brief gales
look likely just ahead of and with the front over the coastal waters.
A secondary system coming onshore on Sunday will keep advisory level
winds going for much of the waters. Surface ridging is expected to
rebuild over the waters on Monday then shift inland for a period of
offshore flow.

Coastal seas are expected to finally dip below 10 feet later Friday,
but will build back into double digits Sunday through Monday night.

.HYDROLOGY...Some small rises on area rivers will be possible
today with scattered shower activity persisting across western
Washington. However, the general trend for area rivers will be to
crest and recede throughout the day. The Skokomish River remains
the only river in flood stage this morning. The river has crested
and will continue to recede through the day, likely falling below
flood stage on Friday morning.

Another system will move into the region over the weekend, bringing
another round of more widespread precipitation to the area. Snow
levels will fluctuate - and look to rise up to 5000-7000 feet on
Saturday, before falling back down to 2000-4000 feet on Sunday.
Can expect some small rises on area rivers over the weekend,
however given the progressive nature of the system and the rapidly
falling snow levels on Sunday, do not expect any widespread river
flooding at this time. The exception may be the Skokomish River,
which may briefly rise back into minor flood stage. Flooding
potential will depend on temperatures, QPF, and snow levels and
will continue to be monitored over the next few days. 14
