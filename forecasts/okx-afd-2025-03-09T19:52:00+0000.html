Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
352 PM EDT Sun Mar 9 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure builds south of the region through Monday. Local
region in between lows southeast and north of the region for
Tuesday. A cold front approaches late Tuesday and moves across
late Tuesday night into early Wednesday. High pressure briefly
builds Wednesday into Wednesday night before moving towards the
Canadian Maritimes. Weak low pressure approaches Thursday into
early Friday. Region will then be in between high pressure in
the Western Atlantic and approaching developing low pressure to
the west heading into next weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM MONDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upr wave exiting the region this aftn will leave windy cond in place
into the eve. As the bl cools, winds will diminish this eve. Another
jet max however passes thru overnight and the associated subsidence
looks to kick winds back up slightly overnight. Main impact with
this is to make the temp fcst challenging. Went close to the NBM
given the mixing winds expected. If things remain decoupled,
particularly across the interior, lows will end up several degrees
colder.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM MONDAY MORNING THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak low pres tracking ewd across the Gulf of ME, along with NW
flow aloft, will be conducive to wly llvl flow thru most of the
day on Mon. This is a warm signal. As the flow aloft weakens
17-20Z, the sea breeze should begin to overspread the coasts.
This should still allow most areas to warm significantly thru
the late mrng into the early aftn. Mixed down temps from h85
then blended in the NBM to produce the high temp grid. Went a
good deal abv the NBM for LI and parts of CT, bringing almost
the entire cwa aoa 60 degrees. If the flow ends up a bit S of W,
or the sea breeze develops too quickly, these numbers will be
too warm.

A dry airmass and broad subsidence should produce no pcpn and few
clouds. There should be some cu invof the sea breeze.

Light sly flow Mon ngt with mainly skc. There could be enough return
flow llvl moisture to allow for some shallow fog to develop. The
prob is too low however attm to include in the fcst. Went with the
NBM for temps.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mainly dry through much of the long term. Possibilities for rain
showers Thursday through Thursday night and a higher possibility for
next weekend, especially for next Sunday. Temperatures overall are
forecast to be above normal on average.

More amplified pattern develops for next weekend. Stronger low
approaches with a strengthening cold front for next Sunday.
Potential for heavy rain and gusty winds with strong meridional flow
ahead of it.

Upper and mid level flow quasi-zonal much of the long term, with
strengthening SW flow for next weekend. Region mainly in between
northern and southern branches of the upper jet. Upper jet southern
branch starts to move into the region for the latter half of next
weekend.

At the surface, weak pressure gradient Tuesday in place across the
area with the area in between systems. Low in Southeast Canada
brings a cold front to the region late Tuesday into early Wednesday.
Cold front expected to move across dry with a lack of available
moisture.

High pressure from Great Lakes and Southeast Canada then briefly
builds into the region Wednesday into Wednesday night. High pressure
moves into the Canadian Maritimes Thursday. Weak low pressure
associated with an inverted trough sets up Thursday across the
region. The region will have more easterly flow. Possible rain
showers in the forecast but just slight chance.

Warming trend for Friday into the weekend. Friday and Friday night
forecast is dry but chances for rain showers increase for next
weekend. Saturday appears to be mainly dry but likelihood increases
substantially next Sunday for rain showers.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
