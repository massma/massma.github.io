Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
610 AM EST Fri Dec 1 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
A weak wave of low pressure impacts the region late today through
tonight. Low pressure moving toward the Great Lakes on Sunday will weaken,
with a secondary low forming south of Long Island Sunday evening and
moving east into the Atlantic later Sunday night into Monday. High
pressure will return for Monday and Tuesday. Low pressure will then
form off the southern Mid Atlantic coast and move out to sea on
Wednesday, followed by building high pressure on Thursday.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The forecast is on track with only minor changes made to
temperatures and dewpoints for the next few hours to account for
the latest observations and trends.

The day begins with weak high pressure in place, which should hold
off any rainfall during the morning with maybe an exception towards
noon well north and west as lift is enhanced here with the passage
of an upper jet streak. Rain otherwise becomes likely generally west
to east late in the day into tonight as isentropic lift and mid-
level shortwave energy shift through. Mid-levels dry out late
tonight with still some lower level lift potentially producing some
drizzle with the remnant low level moisture. Models have trended
weaker regarding wind speeds at the base of a low level inversion
late tonight, so with not as high of a chance that turbulent mixing
disrupts fog formation, coupled with light and variable surface
winds, have added areas of fog to the forecast.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT/...
Low level moisture becomes even more shallow on Saturday along with
weaker lift. Have therefore gone with a dry forecast outside of any
potential drizzle very early on. Remaining mostly cloudy however,
but temperatures will still be above normal in the mid 50s. The next
area of low pressure approaches from the south during Saturday
night. Rain becomes likely for mainly southern areas after midnight.
Temperatures remaining above normal with cloudy conditions.

&&

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
Rain expected for Sunday into Sunday night as primary low pressure
weakens to the west and a new center forms just south of Long Island
Sunday evening. Cyclonic low level flow in its wake as the low moves
well out to sea should maintain a fair amount of clouds for Mon in
its wake, along with a gusty W wind. Both days should feature temps
a few degrees above normal, with colder wx returning Mon night and
beyond as a weak secondary cold front moves through.

Mostly dry wx forecast from that point on. A digging nrn stream
shortwave trough should initiate Miller B type cyclogenesis E of
Hatteras on Wed with the global models showing the low moving due E
out to sea, but this situation bears some watching as it could be
less progressive than forecast as previously noted given model
tendency to underdo western Atlantic ridging downstream of the
digging trough, also presence of some ridging aloft near Greenland
and a 50/50 upper low, all of which might allow the low to get close
enough for its precip shield to graze the coast before exiting.
Forecast carries slight chance PoP for snow/rain showers on land and
chance PoP just offshore.

High pressure is then progged to build in for later in the week.

&&

.AVIATION /11Z FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
High pressure will remain to the S today. Low pressure will
then pass to the W tonight.

VFR for most of the day, then MVFR developing after 20Z with
light rain. Areas of IFR likely after 00Z-03Z with light rain or
drizzle.

SW-SSW winds 5-10 kt should back more S this afternoon. Winds become
light/variable in most spots tonight, but may veer SW along the
coast.

 ...NY Metro(KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

No unscheduled AMD expected.

OUTLOOK FOR 06Z SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...

Tonight: IFR in light rain/drizzle.

Saturday: Chance of light rain/drizzle, with MVFR or lower cond
possible.

Sunday: Rain with MVFR or lower cond likely. N winds G15-20kt NYC
metro/coast late at night.

Monday: Chance of rain. MVFR or lower cond likely especially AM.
NW winds G20kt.

Tuesday: Chance of rain early, VFR by the afternoon. NW winds
G20kt.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Expecting an extended period of sub-advisory conditions through
at least Sunday with winds becoming lighter today and remaining
on the the light side well into the weekend. There could be a
brief period Saturday afternoon where a swell builds to 5 ft on
the eastern ocean waters, but not anticipating the need for an
advisory just yet.

A period of SCA cond expected for the ocean waters from Sunday night
into Tue AM, with W flow gusting to 25 kt and seas building to 5-6
ft in the wake of departing low pressure, then shifting NW with
passage of a secondary cold front with gusts increasing to 30 kt and
seas to 5-7 ft. SCA cond likely on the non ocean waters Mon night
following this fropa as well, with NW flow gusting to 25 kt.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...
No hydrologic impacts expected with today/tonight`s rainfall. Rainfall
of about 3/4 inch expected Sunday into Sunday night. Light to moderate
intensity and long duration preclude any issues.
