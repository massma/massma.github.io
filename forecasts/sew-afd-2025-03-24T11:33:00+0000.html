Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
433 AM PDT Mon Mar 24 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Atmospheric river over the central and northern
portion of the area today lifting north tonight and Tuesday as an
upper level ridge builds into the area from the south. Ridge
shifting east Tuesday night. Next system moving into the area
later Wednesday. Very unstable air mass for Washington in place
Wednesday with thunderstorms in the forecast. Upper level trough
offshore will keep the weather unsettled Thursday into the
weekend. Next system arriving from the southwest late in the
weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Doppler radar has rain
over most of the area early this morning as an atmospheric river
sits over Western Washington. Westerly flow aloft created a rain
shadow over Northern King and Southern Snohomish county Sunday
into early this morning. Quillayute reported 4.23 inches of rain
Sunday, the 3rd wettest March day on record, while here at the
office we got 0.08 inches of rain. That is what 30 to 45 mph
westerly winds at 850 mb will do for you. With the clouds and rain
it has been a mild night with temperatures at 4 am/11z in the
upper 40s to mid 50s.

Satellite imagery shows the atmospheric river still aimed at the
central and northern portions of Western Washington this morning.
IVT values lowering from the peak of near 800 kg/m/s down to 400
to 500 kg/m/s so not expecting as much rainfall today versus
Sunday. The moisture will eventually overwhelm the rain shadow
near the KIng/Snohomish county line later this morning into this
afternoon. Upper level ridge evident on the imagery to the south
over Oregon. The high in Medford Sunday was 68 degrees. This air
mass is headed our way and will be here Tuesday. In the meantime
highs today in the 50s and lower 60s.

Upper level ridge building into Southwest Washington tonight
pushing the atmospheric river north into Southern British
Columbia. The river will be close enough to keep a chance of rain
near the Canadian border and at least the North Coast. It will be
another mild night with another round of record high low
temperatures, a couple of degrees either side of 50.

Ridge continuing to build over the entire area Tuesday pushing the
rain chances out of the northern portion of the area in the
morning. As mentioned earlier the high at Medford Sunday was 68
degrees. This is a good forecast for Seattle for the high Tuesday.
With each model runs highs get a touch warmer with the Southwest
Interior, Southern Hood Canal, portions of the Lower Chehalis
Valley and Cascade foothills all now in the 70s for highs. For the
remainder of the area mid to upper 60s. Numerous record highs will
be set Tuesday.

Upper level ridge shifting slightly east Tuesday night. This will
open the door up for another system to approach the area
Wednesday. Air mass very unstable for Western Washington with all
of the instability indexes indicating the good possibility of
convection. CAPE values as high as 1000 J/kg late Wednesday
morning into the afternoon ( this is nothing in the Midwest for
for here it is a big number ). Models are picking up on a couple
pieces of energy spinning out of the large upper level low
offshore. One moving through mid to late morning. The other one
later in the afternoon. Have increased the thunderstorm pops into
the chance category ( 30 to 50 percent ) on Wednesday. This
scenario has the potential to create flash flooding in the burn
scar areas. Flash flooding can not totally be ruled out in the
lowlands as well with the possible brief downpours. High
temperatures will be a tough call Wednesday. The air mass will
still be very warm but the increasing cloud cover and possible
convection have the potential to keep highs below Tuesday`s high
temperatures, mostly in the 60s. Another mild night Tuesday night
with lows near 50.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Models in good agreement
with a large upper level trough offshore. Southwesterly flow aloft
sending showers into Western Washington both days. Temperatures
cooling back down to near normal, in the lower to mid 50s.

Could see a little break in the weather Saturday before another
negatively tilted front approaches for the southwest Sunday.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal boundary continues to stall over western
Washington early this morning with westerly flow aloft. A mixed
bag of conditions out there this morning as showers continue
across the region. Widespread MVFR/IFR will continue early this
morning with showers starting to decrease in coverage by later
this afternoon. Given the  moisture across area terminals,
conditions will likely stay deteriorated into the evening with
localized pockets of IFR/LIFR across lower prone terminals (KPWT,
KCLM, KHQM, KPAE). Gusty southerly winds will start to ease this
morning, but will generally remain around 8 to 12 knots through
the day.

KSEA...VFR/MVFR ceilings early this morning with periods of rain.
Rain will start to ease by the afternoon but conditions will
likely stay at MVFR, with a 25% chance of IFR conditions at times
throughout the afternoon. Southerly surface winds 8 to 12 knots
this morning with gusts up to 20 kts. Winds will start to ease
early this afternoon but will remain elevated, around 5 to 10
knots.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system exiting our area will make room for a
weak high pressure to develop offshore, leading to more benign
and calmer conditions into Tuesday. A stronger frontal system will
approach the area waters Wednesday into Thursday leading to
another round of strong southerlies across the waters. Latest
guidance suggests possible gale strength winds over the coastal
waters, and even potentially the East Entrance of the Strait, with
small craft strength winds likely elsewhere.

Combined seas have subsided below 10 feet and will generally
remain around 8 to 9 into Tuesday. Seas will build back up on
Wednesday around 10 to 14 feet. Building seas will continue into
Thursday as seas could build around 18 to 22 feet, with the
largest seas (20 to 22 feet) mainly being located in the outer
water zones.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Multiple flood warnings issued overnight for rivers
flowing out of the Central Cascades. 12 hour precipitation
amounts in the Central Cascades ranged from 1.75 inches to a
little over 2.5 inches overnight. Doppler rainfall rates still
showing 0.25 to 0.50 inch an hour bullseye rates over the
Cascades of Snohomish county. Flood warnings currently up for the
Tolt near Carnation, Skykomish at Gold Bar and the Stillaguamish
at Arlington. All of these river will crest near flood stage this
morning. Additional warnings may be needed for the Snoqualmie and
Snohomish rivers later this morning.

Rainfall rates decreasing in the Olympics and Central and Northern
Cascades today. Rivers flowing off the Olympics are cresting this
morning.

Atmospheric river lifting north tonight ending the hydrologically
significant precipitation. The lower reaches of the long stem
rivers will be cresting tonight.

Drier weather is expected on Tuesday allowing river levels to
recede. Another round of potentially heavier rain at times on
Wednesday associated with showers and thunderstorms. A cooler
weather pattern returns Thursday into next weekend. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
