Area Forecast Discussion...CORRECTED
National Weather Service New York NY
358 PM EDT Sun Sep 15 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure remains in control through Monday night, before
gradually retreating north Tuesday into Tuesday night. A frontal
system slowly approaches from the southwest through mid- week
as high pressure drifts east in the northern Atlantic. The
frontal system remains in the vicinity towards the end of next
week. A back door cold front moves through Friday.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH MONDAY/...
With deep layered ridging in place with a 588 dm closed height
signature expect the dry weather to continue. For tonight with high
pressure aloft and at the surface expect mainly clear skies. With
lower dew points compared to earlier this weekend, the column
further down will be relatively drier.  Thus the prospects for
patchy fog are less likely during tonight. With a dome of high
pressure and large scale subsidence mainly clear to partly cloudy
skies prevails. The winds will be light and variable to NE in
direction once again. Therefore expect radiational conditions, but
with the lack of a true cP air mass and a very light onshore flow at
times there is a floor as to how much temperatures can fall as dew
points will be in the 50s and not the 40s.

With high pressure and large scale ridging holding this is basically
a persistence forecast through Monday. The winds once again will be
light and variable to begin the day, but with solar insolation
expect the winds towards late morning and mid day to be more ENE at
around 5 to 10 mph. It will be another partly to mostly sunny day
with temperatures at seasonable levels for mid September.


&&

.SHORT TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
For Monday night the upper level ridging begins to slowly break
down. More in the way of high clouds attempts to work in as low
pressure off the southeastern US coast begins to work NW. High
pressure however, especially when considering some subtle trends in
the guidance looks to be a bit slower in breaking down. Therefore it
remains partly cloudy to mostly clear Monday night with a light E to
NE flow remaining in place. With a bit more moisture in the lower
levels there should once again be a reasonable chance to see some
low stratus / patchy fog in many of the lower lying rural locations
like previous nights as of late. Temperatures should average close
to normal in outlying areas, and a bit above normal in the more
urban areas.

On Tuesday surface high pressure remains in place and doesn`t really
show much retreat until later in the day. A southerly component to
the flow aloft begins to get established during the afternoon as the
region gets on the outer edge of the northeast quadrant of a closed
low getting into the Lower Appalachians. The mid levels may moisten
up enough to produce more in the way of mid level clouds, especially
as the day progress. Thus a partly cloudy to mostly cloudy day from
NE to SW across the region appears most likely. With more mid and
upper level clouds compared to lower level clouds, expect the clouds
to mainly filter out varying amounts of sun. Temperatures will once
again run right around seasonable levels. Dew point readings should
edge up in the 60s, especially along the coast as the day proceeds.
Introduced mainly slight chance PoPs later in the day as questions
remain how quickly any shower activity can get into the area.

&&

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...
Deep layered ridging with high pressure off the northwestern
Atlantic starts off the long term Tuesday night. The high slowly
drifts east through mid-week. At the same time, low pressure over
the Carolinas will slowly trek northwestward toward the Ohio Valley
through mid-week. The associated frontal system will approach from
the southwest and will begin to impact the region Tuesday night

The low and frontal system get caught under the upper level ridging
over the eastern US from mid to late week and a prolonged period of
some unsettled weather is possible as weak flow under the ridge will
mean slow movement of these features. Right now, it looks like the
most likely period of rain is Tuesday night through Wednesday night.
There is a deep moisture feed from the tropics and training
possible. Dew points rise well into the 60s Wednesday into Thursday
and PWATs of 1.50"-2.25" are seen in some of the guidance. Of
course, this is all dependent on certain mesoscale features that
cannot be resolved at this point, but there is a low chance right
now of flooding, and the Weather Prediction Center has placed the
entire forecast area in a marginal risk of excessive rainfall
Wednesday into Thursday. With the previously mentioned uncertainty,
stuck close to the NBM and did not go any higher than chance POPs
through the long term.

Thereafter, the system finally begins to nudge south with the
approach of a back door cold front Thursday night, which now looks
to move through Friday. High pressure builds in from the northeast
next weekend.

Temperatures will average near seasonable, perhaps a degree or so
above Wednesday through Friday. Went slightly below guidance on
Wednesday and Thursday with cloudy skies and showers in the
forecast. Near normal to slightly below normal temperatures are
expected for next weekend with Canadian high pressure building in
from the northeast.

.AVIATION /20Z SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure along the New England coast will gradually work
out into the Atlantic through Monday.

VFR. Low chance of patchy IFR/MVFR Monday morning from about
08Z to 13Z. This seems less likely than recent days due to some
drier low-level air in place.

Winds will be E/SE at 7-12 kt through early this evening with a few
gusts 15-20kt early. Winds will then diminish tonight and back to
the E/NE at 5 kt or less. E/SE flow redevelops by Monday afternoon.

...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Low chance of patchy MVFR/IFR from 08-13Z Monday.

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...

Monday Afternoon through Tuesday: Chance of MVFR or lower
conditions with low clouds/fog each late night/early morning,
otherwise VFR.

Wednesday and Friday: Chance of showers with MVFR or lower
conditions possible. ENE winds 10-15kt G15-20kt, mainly at
the coastal terminals.

.MARINE...
No advisories are anticipated for the coastal waters to begin the
week. Ocean seas are likely to remain primarily at 3 to 4 ft with an
8 second period SE swell. Ocean seas may momentarily get close to 5
ft by towards Tuesday afternoon and evening, especially for the
western ocean. 5 ft waves are expected Tuesday night on the ocean
waters. More widespread 5 ft waves on the ocean waters are expected
Wednesday on a persistent easterly flow. The flow increases
Thursday night, and waves continue to build to 5 to 7 ft across
the ocean waters on Friday. Additionally, wind gusts of 25 to 30
kt are possible Friday into Friday night with the approach and
passage of a back door cold front.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
No hydrologic concerns through the short term. An extended
period of rain is possible from Tuesday night through Wednesday
night with a tropical feed and training possible. There is a
great deal of uncertainty this far out. The Weather Prediction
Center has placed the entire forecast area in marginal risk for
excessive rainfall. One factor against flooding would be the
antecedent dry conditions over the last week.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
With an approaching full moon on the 17th, astronomical high tides
will be rising into the first half of the week, with water levels
potentially rising through the week. Continuous easterly flow will
help build seas and allow for some piling of water. Winds are
expected to remain generally light, near 10 kt or less. While some
of the guidance is showing water levels increasing, there is a
general consensus of keeping them below minor coastal flooding
benchmarks for the most part, although Stevens suggest minor
benchmarks being reached for the south shore bays and for western LI
Sound locations towards late Tue / Wed. However, this will likely
depend on the development of low pressure off the Carolina coast and
its eventual track early next week.

There is a moderate risk of rip current development at the ocean
beaches Sunday and Monday with an easterly flow developing.
