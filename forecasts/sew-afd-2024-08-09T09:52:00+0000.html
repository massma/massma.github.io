Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
252 AM PDT Fri Aug 9 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Warmer temperatures again today before some cooling
Saturday. Areas of lofted smoke and haze will continue into
Saturday due to mid-level east flow today. A chance of
thunderstorms exists, primarily over the Cascades, each afternoon
through Saturday, peaking today. Onshore flow will bring cooler
conditions next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Generally clear for most
areas early this morning, with continued stratus along the coast
and into the Southwest Interior. There is an increase in some mid
level clouds Snohomish County northward, and particularly into the
North Cascades. Elevated instability continues, even during the
early morning hours, as a few thunderstorms have been observed
over the last few hours over the North Cascades, as well as
towards Glacier in Whatcom County. The combination of both
elevated instability, with some increasing moisture aloft will
result in the potential development of further showers, isolated
t-storms over Whatcom County early this morning, before activity
slides northward. There remains an increased threat for
thunderstorms this afternoon and evening over the Cascades,
particularly the Cascades of Snohomish County northward, as shown
on the HREF probabilities. For this reason, a Red Flag Warning
remains in effect for this area, refer to the fire weather
discussion for further info. With that said, a few isolated
thunderstorms may also develop towards Mt. Rainier as shown on a
few members of HREF, but confidence is lower in widespread
coverage across the southern Cascades.

In addition to the convection potential, another very warm day is
expected for portions of Western Washington. Temperatures are
expected to range in the 80s for much of the interior, with low
90s in the Cascade Foothills. Cooler temperatures are expected
along the coast. However, some uncertainty remains in the
temperature forecast today due to continued haze aloft from
wildfire smoke drifting over the area due to mid-level east flow.
Moderate HeatRisk levels will continue for today.

Onshore flow will increase a bit further into Saturday, allowing
for some additional cooling by Saturday afternoon. Haze will
likely continue, although westerly flow will begin to increase. A
slight chance for thunderstorms continues on Saturday, mainly in
the North Cascades. Onshore flow will increase further into
Sunday, with much cooler conditions, along with widespread morning
stratus.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Troughing will develop
further over the Pacific Northwest early next week for continued
onshore flow. Ensembles generally agree in below normal
temperatures during this period due to increased onshore flow.
Although precipitation potential remains limited next week,
widespread morning clouds are expected with perhaps some drizzle.
Temperatures next week will range in the mid 60s along the coast
to mid 70s for the interior area. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft today before turning more
northwesterly into Saturday. Marine stratus currently making its
early morning push inland as always in these sorts of patterns. LIFR
cigs currently along the coast (KHQM) and nearing KSHN. Stratus will
continue towards KPWT and KOLM as the morning progress. A lesser
chance (15-20%) that IFR/LIFR reaches Puget Sound terminals (KSEA,
KBFI, KPAE, etc). Any lingering stratus should burn off by 18z
across the interior but`ll hug the coast throughout the afternoon.
Haze due to smoke from nearby wildfires may cause small reductions
in visibility but mostly VFR is expected into the second half of the
day. More marine stratus is expected overnight into Saturday.

KSEA...VFR currently at the terminal so far this morning. However, a
15-20% chance of IFR to LIFR cigs are possible between 12-16z but if
manifest should burn off by 18z. Light winds increasing out of the
northwest between 5-10 kt in the afternoon/evening. A better chance
of marine stratus looks evident overnight into Saturday morning.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure remains offshore into next week with
persistent onshore flow at play. High resolution guidance indicates
a 40-50% chance of SCA level gusts through the eastern/central
section of Strait of Juan de Fuca for a brief window this evening
but not long enough to issue an advisory. However, will continue to
monitor conditions. A SCA threat again looks to manifest on Saturday
afternoon/evening where stronger onshore flow is arriving through
the same area. Seas over the coastal waters will remain rather steep
with dominant period around 8 seconds. Combined seas generally 5 to
7 feet, largest over the waters beyond 20 nm from shore.

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridging situated over northern Canada
will continue to bring warm temperatures and generally drier
conditions to the region through today.

An upper level shortwave trough will brush Washington to the
north today bringing increasing instability to the region. Latest
thunderstorm probabilities for this afternoon and evening continue
to indicate around a 20-35% chance of convection across the
Cascades and 10-20% chance of convection across the Olympics. Not
much in the way of precipitation is expected with any
thunderstorms that initially develop along the western slopes of
the Cascades. Chances of a wetting rain generally remain at 10% or
less. Thus, any lightning strikes that occur could spark new
fires across the region. There also remains a slight chance of
thunderstorms through this morning over Whatcom County, although
probabilities are low for widespread convection through the
morning.

A Red Flag Warning remains in affect for the North
Cascades zone of 658 for thunderstorms and gusty outflow winds
through Friday evening. Isolated thunderstorms may also develop
this afternoon across zone 659, particularly near Mount Rainier,
however, confidence is low in thunderstorm coverage for this area.

A threat for thunderstorms remains across the North Cascades on
Saturday afternoon and evening, however chances will wane as the
shortwave moves to the east. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
