.PREV DISCUSSION... <span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>/issued 218 AM PST Tue Feb 11 2025/

.SYNOPSIS...Dry conditions with cold temperatures through early
Thursday with troughing over the interior Rockies. A weather
system will move into Oregon later Thursday into Friday and may
spread precipitation as far north as Puget Sound during this
period. A return to a more onshore flow pattern, with warming
temperatures, and additional precipitation expected next weekend.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Clear skies across Western
Washington early this morning with very cold conditions for the
area. Widespread 20s across the area as of 200 AM with wind
chills dipping down into the teens for northern portions of
Western Washington and along the Olympic Peninsula. Temperatures
will only rise into the 30s for most areas this afternoon with a
few low 40s possible along the coast. Otherwise, very cold
temperatures are expected again tonight into Wednesday morning.
For this reason, the Cold Weather Advisory continues for the
lowlands through Wednesday morning. Make sure to bundle up if
you`re heading outdoors the next few mornings.

The next frontal system will begin to move onshore along the
Oregon coast Thursday morning, and spread precipitation
northwards into southern Washington Thursday afternoon into
Thursday night. Given the antecedent colder airmass in place,
along with continued offshore flow, predominantly snow, or a
rain/snow mix would be expected. There remains uncertainty in
ensembles as to how far northwards accumulating snowfall is
possible. Current NBM probabilities of 1 inch of snow through
early Friday morning peak at 20-30% for Olympia southwards, with
lower probabilities towards 5-15% around Seattle. Of note, there
was a slight uptick in the probabilities from the 00z LREF (GFS,
CMC, ECMWF ensembles) for southern portions of Western Washington,
so will have to monitor additional trends in guidance as we get
closer to Thursday-Friday. Otherwise, temperatures will warm
slightly Thursday, but only a little, as temperatures Thursday
morning likely remain in the low to mid 20s for much of the area.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...There may be a brief period
of drier weather Friday afternoon through Friday night as the
aforementioned frontal system slides east into the Rockies. The
next weather system looks to arrive on Saturday, ushering in a
return of onshore flow, and thus a slow warming trend in
temperatures, resulting in mostly rain for the lowlands and
mountain snowfall. A wintry mix may still be possible at the onset
of the precipitation Saturday morning, mainly around Whatcom
County and into the Cascade Valleys. Otherwise, decent agreement
in ensembles suggests an unsettled weather pattern continues from
later Saturday through early next week. If you`re traveling over
the Cascade Passes during this period, make sure to monitor
forecasts. Although below normal temperatures may continue over
the weekend, highs will begin to reach the mid 40s for most of the
area. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Dry northerly flow aloft will continue through the TAF
period. VFR with clear skies expected areawide today, with little to
no patchy freezing fog expected to develop tonight into Wednesday
morning as dew points look to remain quite low across the region.

KSEA...VFR with clear skies. Surface winds E/NE 4 to 7 knots
shifting northerly by afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Fraser River outflow will subside today as a surface
ridge over the interior of British Columbia weakens. A broad surface
low approaching the offshore waters Wednesday night into Thursday
will enhance offshore flow with small craft advisory easterly winds
expected in the west entrance to the strait and portions of the
coastal waters adjacent to gaps in terrain. The low will weaken as
it moves into the Oregon coastal waters late in week. A more
organized frontal system will reach the area over the weekend with
headlines for both wind and seas expected.
