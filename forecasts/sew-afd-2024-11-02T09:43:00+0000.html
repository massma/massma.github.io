.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Unsettled weather conditions will linger over the
weekend with showers continuing, especially in the Cascades. A
stronger frontal system will arrive on Monday for more rain,
widespread breezy to locally windy conditions, mountain snow and
high surf conditions. Drier weather is possible by midweek.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Troughing continues over the
Pac NW today and Sunday with additional showers and cooler
weather (lower mountain snow levels). The bulk of the showers
will be over the Cascades today with a reinforcing shot of
lift and moisture tonight into Sunday as a frontal system moves
inland. Snow levels will hover around 3500-4000` with accumulating
snow expected at the higher Cascade passes like Stevens and White
Pass - a Winter Weather Advisory is in effect.

Down on the lowlands, temperatures will track near to slightly
cooler than average. Expect lows in the low to mid 40s and highs
in the lower to mid 50s. The coast will see rain by mid to late
afternoon with rain shifting into the interior this evening. A few
showers may linger into Sunday morning with drier weather toward
the afternoon.

A stronger Pacific system makes its may to WA on Monday with
another round of rain and windy weather (mainly coast and north
interior), and heavy mountain snow (central and north Cascades).
Snow levels initially start low around 3500` but increase through
the day to around 4000-4500`. A strong onshore push develops
Monday night with the focus for wind impacts switching to the
strait and Admiralty Inlet area. 33

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...High pressure brings a
quieter period of weather from Tuesday through the end of the
week as moisture is deflected north into B.C. Temperatures will
be cooler, though, with lows dipping into the 30s Wednesday and
Thursday mornings. The ridge shows signs of weakening/flattening
toward the weekend with rain returning to western WA. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>NW flow aloft as a trough moves through the area. A
mixed bag of ceilings continues with ceilings MVFR to IFR with
scattered showers continuing, VFR conditions away from those
showers. More widespread MVFR conditions should develop this morning
around 12Z before slowly lifting back up to VFR early this
afternoon. Another period of MVFR conditions will develop this
afternoon into this evening as a cold front passes across the area
with another round of rain showers moving through the area this
evening. Winds remain southwesterly through the TAF period 5 to 10
kt.

KSEA...MVFR conditions in scattered showers with occasional breaks
to VFR this morning. More widespread MVFR conditions early this
morning after 12Z with shower activity tapering off. Ceilings will
slowly rise back to VFR around 19-21Z before falling back to MVFR
this evening with another round of rain. Winds remain southwesterly
5 to 10 kt through the TAF period.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface trough continues to move inland through
Washington this morning. Saturday will allow for a period of
relatively benign conditions with the lull between systems. A cold
front will move through the waters tonight into Sunday.
Northwesterly winds behind the cold front look to increase to Small
Craft Advisory strength across the outer coastal zones. A push of
westerlies down the Strait of Juan de Fuca may create periods of
Small Craft Advisory strength winds through early Sunday morning, in
particular through the East Entrance and Admiralty Inlet. Winds will
ease during the day on Sunday before another system approaches the
area on Monday. Widespread gusty winds, potentially reaching gale
force, are possible ahead of the front. Strong westerly winds will
continue behind the front Monday afternoon into Monday evening,
where gale force winds are likely through the Strait of Juan de
Fuca. A few gusts approaching storm force cannot be ruled out during
this period through the Central and East Strait.

High pressure will build across the area Tuesday through mid-week,
allowing winds to ease on Tuesday and remain benign through the week.

Seas across the coastal waters remain around 7 to 9 ft and remain
like so through tonight. Seas will begin to rise above 10 ft
tonight. Long period swell being generated by a low pressure system
in the Gulf of Alaska is on track to arrive Sunday morning, bringing
waves 14 to 18 ft with a dominant period of around 19 seconds. This
may bring high surf conditions to the Pacific Coast. Seas will
rapidly rise Monday morning as the next low pressure system moves
through the area waters, with seas up to 18 to 22 feet possible
(with the highest seas being in the outer water zones). This will be
another period to monitor for high surf conditions. Seas will slowly
subside Monday night into Tuesday, below 10 ft by Tuesday night and
remain around 5 to 8 ft through mid-week.
