Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
921 AM PDT Wed Aug 7 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Warming temperatures are expected through Friday.
Easterly flow over the Cascades will bring some areas of haze into
Western Washington beginning early Thursday. Thunderstorm
potential increases over the Cascades later this week, likely
peaking on Friday. Troughing may develop early next week for a
cooling trend.

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Widespread stratus is in place across the majority of
the lowlands this morning. This stratus will burn off through the
day, but will slow the temperature rise this morning. As such, the
forecast was updated to bring temperatures down a few degrees,
especially in the lowlands. Otherwise little change was made to
the previous forecast. Today`s focus will be be on temperatures
Thursday/Friday and the impact smoke may have and whether any
alerts will be necessary. -Wolcott-<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Ridging will begin to build
a bit further into Western Washington today for warming
temperatures, with highs into the mid 70s to mid 80s.

Easterly flow at 925/850mb will increase over the Cascades
Thursday and Friday, with continued warming temperatures both
days. In addition to warming temperatures, east flow will also
bring haze and smoke from wildfires over the Cascades into
portions of Western Washington. Winds at the surface will
generally be northerly, with a light east component during the
overnight period. Although temperatures will be relatively hot
both days, there is some uncertainty given the haze expected
aloft. Current forecast highs generally range in the 80s to mid
90s Thursday and Friday with cooler temperatures along the coast.
HeatRisk levels are primarily widespread Moderate, with localized
Major HeatRisk into portions of the King County metro and
foothills, particularly due to warmer Friday morning lows.

In addition to the heat and haze, instability will increase aloft
over the Cascades & Olympics Thursday and Friday, with the
development of isolated thunderstorms possible. NBM probabilities
range 15 to 20% over the North Cascades Thursday, with potential
peaking on Friday afternoon and evening (15-35%). See fire
weather discussion for additional details. Otherwise, onshore flow
may slowly increase Friday night for some slight cooling.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Troughing may begin to
influence the PacNW over the weekend for increasing onshore flow
and a slow cooling trend Saturday into Sunday. In addition, flow
transitions a bit more westerly, likely beginning to clear
lingering haze over Western Washington. There also remains a
slight chance (15-20%) of thunderstorms over the Cascades on
Saturday. Uncertainty begins to increase in ensembles early next
week in regards to the extent troughing develops over the Pacific
Northwest. However, troughing will likely continue the cooling
trend into next week, with continued relatively dry conditions and
temperatures near normal across the area. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Flow aloft is west-northwest with ridging upstream.
Marine stratus has pushed into the interior this morning for
mainly IFR to LIFR cigs across the region. Stratus remains
shallow, so expect clouds to scatter between 18-20Z for an
improvement to more widespread VFR ceilings. Another push of
stratus is likely to develop overnight into Thursday morning and
looks to push inland into portions of the Sound for another round
of lower ceilings.

KSEA...IFR conditions in marine stratus this morning. Expect
ceilings to improve towards VFR between 17-19Z. Surface winds
from the north, increasing this morning and generally persisting
between 7-12 kt today. Winds will decrease and become light at the
terminal again overnight. Guidance showing a 15-20% chance of
MVFR/IFR cigs possible again Thursday morning. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.MARINE...Broad surface high pressure to remain offshore and lower
pressure inland will maintain onshore flow in varying degrees. A
small craft advisory through eastern and central strait is expiring
this morning as generally benign conditions are expected for all
waters. However, another round of SCA winds are possible to develop
Friday afternoon/evening for the central and eastern strait again.
Persistent northwest winds will continue over the outer coastal
waters, maintaining steep seas generally around 4 to 6 feet.

.FIRE WEATHER...Upper level ridging will begin to build into the
area starting today bringing warmer temperatures and drier
conditions through the rest of the week. Onshore flow will
fluctuate throughout the week, with Thursday likely bringing a
brief period of lower minimum RHs, although critical RH levels are
not expected at this time.

Instability will increase Thursday afternoon as a weak
disturbance clips the Canadian border, which may trigger some
thunderstorm development along the North Cascades. The particular
area we are monitoring is mainly the northern portion of zone 658
near the Canadian border. In addition, probabilities increase
further Friday afternoon over the Cascades for the potential
development of convection (current probabilities at 15-35%). With
a lower potential again on Saturday. This threat of convection
will continued to be monitored given the potential for lightning
strikes to spark new fires. JD/Mazurkiewicz
