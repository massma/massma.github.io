Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
913 AM PDT Sat Jun 21 2025

.SYNOPSIS...A wet and cooler weather pattern will continue into
today as an upper level low moves through Western Washington. A
building upper ridge will lead to drier and warmer conditions
Sunday through Tuesday before a weak trough produces a cooling
trend around the middle of next week.


&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No major changes have been
made to the forecast this morning. Radar trends indicate the bulk
of the moisture moving south toward Oregon, but residual showers
are likely to linger throughout the early afternoon. The rest of
the previous discussion can be found below.

An additional quarter to half an inch remains possible through
this afternoon, with locally higher amounts in the mountains. Snow
levels around 5000-5500 ft this morning will allow for an inch or
two of new snow at the higher elevation peaks and at Paradise.
Rain will taper off Saturday night, though a few showers may
linger over the mountains Saturday night into Sunday. Elsewhere,
conditions dry out Sunday and on Monday as high pressure begins to
reestablish itself over the region.

High temperatures today will remain in the 60s but the warming trend
begins Sunday with highs a few degrees on either side of 70.
Monday`s highs should reach the mid to upper 70s. Lows will remain
in the mid 40s to low 50s.


.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Tuesday remains on track to be
the warmest day of the next seven with highs reaching the low to mid
80s. In the upper levels, flow is split behind the departing upper
level low but we will be under the influence of a ridge that extends
north into British Columbia. A couple of weak shortwave troughs look
to push quickly through the area with the main impact being cooler
temperatures, back into the 70s, cloudy skies, and slight chances
for light rain showers through Friday. 62<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper low will continue to progress eastwards into
the interior Northwest into Saturday for increasing northerly flow
aloft. MVFR/IFR cigs early this morning with stratiform rain
sliding southwards across Western Washington. Lower MVFR/IFR cigs
will likely continue throughout the early afternoon for most
sites. In addition, brief vsby reductions are possible towards
3-5 SM in rainfall through this morning. Some improvements towards
VFR by late Saturday afternoon into Saturday evening as conditions
begin to dry. S/SW surface winds. Lower ceilings likely to make a
return early Sunday morning.

KSEA...IFR cigs this morning with abundant mid clouds and rain.
Vsbys may also briefly lower towards 4-6 SM periodically in rain
Cigs are expected to remain MVFR into the afternoon, before some
potential improvements to VFR generally around 22 Sat to 00z Sun.
S/SW surface winds 8 to 12 knots this morning becoming 4 to 8
knots later this afternoon. MVFR looks to return by Sunday
morning at the terminal around 13z-16z.

.MARINE...A weather system will continue to progress east of the
region on Saturday. High pressure will build over the waters on
Sunday. Elevated northwest winds will continue over the Coastal
Waters through this afternoon, before dissipating Saturday night. A
Small Craft Advisory remains in effect for the outer Coastal Waters
due to a combination of winds and seas through the afternoon. An
onshore flow pattern will then continue next week, resulting in
periods of increased west winds through the Strait of Juan de Fuca,
particularly Sunday evening, and again Tuesday evening.

Seas will build to 10 to 11 feet for the outer Coastal Waters this
morning, before subsiding below 10 feet Saturday evening. In
addition, the period will only be 8 to 9 seconds through Saturday,
resulting in choppy seas for the outer Coastal Waters. Seas will
further subside to 4 to 6 feet Sunday into Monday. JD
