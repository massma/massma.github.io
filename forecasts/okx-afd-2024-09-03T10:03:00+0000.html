Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
603 AM EDT Tue Sep 3 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure builds into the region through the middle of the
week, gradually moving offshore mid to late week. The high
weakens across the area Friday as low pressure approaches. The
low passes to the north during Saturday sending a cold front
through the region Saturday night into Sunday. High pressure
returns for Monday.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The forecast is on track with only minor changes needed.

Tranquil weather continues with high pressure building in from
the west as an upper level trough pushes off the Northeast
Coast. The center of the high should move overhead late in the
day into early tonight. Subsidence associated with the high
should provide for mostly sunny skies.

Cold air advection will mean temperatures will be around 5 to 10
degrees below normal today, with highs in the lower to middle
70s. It will also allow the dry conditions to continue as dew
points in the 40s are expected region-wide today. Some isolated
dew point readings could dip into the upper 30s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/...
Good radiational cooling conds for far outlying areas tonight
with clear skies and light winds. Lows around 40 degrees for
far outlying areas (some isolate upper 30s possible, mainly in
the Pine Barrens of Long Island), with upper 50s for NYC/NJ
metro.

Canadian airmass moderates a bit on Wednesday, as high pressure
slides offshore with return onshore flow. Temps still a few
degrees below seasonable with highs in the mid 70s interior/
upper 70s city/coast.

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
Offshore high pressure early Friday will be weakening across the
region as offshore low pressure tracks northward and a cold front
and low approach from the west. Global guidance has become more
consistent with not phasing the southern stream low with a northern
stream trough that will be amplifying into the upper midwest at the
end of the week and into the weekend. The upper trough evolves into
a closed low Friday night into Saturday that then slowly moves
eastward, reaching eastern Canada and New England by Tuesday. There
is still the possibility of a period of moderate to heavy rainfall
Saturday into Saturday night with the approach and passage of a cold
front, and as precipitable water values increase to around 1.75
inches and a low level jet of 25 to 35 kt moves into the area.
There will be little CAPE and shear, with little surface based
instability Saturday into Saturday night so have included a mention
of thunder, however, storms may be more isolated.
High pressure returns Sunday into the beginning of next week.
With some uncertainties remaining with the timing and placement of
the southern low and the northern cold front have stayed close to
the NBM throughout the extended period.
Temperatures will be near normals levels Friday, and then 5 to
nearly 10 degrees below normals Saturday into the beginning of next
week.

&&

.AVIATION /10Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
VFR with high pressure approaching the terminals, moving overhead
this evening.

SW to light and variable this evening.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

also reach KLGA around 23Z, however, with low confidence did not
include in the forecast at this time.

.MARINE...
SCA remains in effect on the ocean waters through 8 am this
morning, with buoy 44025 still gusting to 25 kt as of 4 am.
Winds will diminish today with center of high pressure
approaching from the west today, so the pressure gradient is
expected to relax. Sub-SCA conditions are then expected through
Thursday morning. Waves build to 5 ft on the ocean Thursday
afternoon into Thursday night as an easterly flow develops.

With a persistent easterly flow continuing Friday into Saturday
night ocean seas are likely to be at SCA levels. With the passage of
a cold front Saturday night into Sunday morning winds will become
northerly and ocean seas will slowly subside Sunday into Sunday
night. The non ocean waters remain below advisory levels Friday
through Sunday.
