Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
344 PM PDT Fri Jun 13 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low will remain offshore of British
Columbia through the weekend into much of next week. Clouds this
afternoon will partially clear across the region. This weekend
will be dry, with sky coverage becoming clearer Saturday into
Sunday. A couple of shortwave troughs and weak fronts will bring
chances for showers off and on next week. Temperatures will
remain around average with highs in the upper 60s to low 70s, and
lows in the 40s and 50s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level analysis shows
an upper level low just off the coast of northwest B.C.. The flow
aloft is southwest as a couple of weak troughs swing around the
low today/early Saturday. No significant weather is expected with
these troughs (other than there will remain a few more clouds
today with clearing expected to be minimal over most of western
WA,except for along and north of the Strait of Juan de Fuca). As
such, highs will remain cool with some areas remaining in the 50s
(some urban areas and areas clear will have the best chance of
seeing temps creep up into the 60s). Conditions will be dry
regionwide (though could be a few sprinkles in the Cascades this
afternoon).

Over the weekend: Down at the surface, high pressure will build
offshore with lower heights further inland to the east. This will
keep the flow onshore with light west to northwest winds at the
surface. There will be a descent push of marine air
tonight/Saturday morning (which will push most clouds back in
across the region). Once the weak trough passes through, clouds
will clear out going into Saturday afternoon and it will remain
dry through the weekend. Sunday will be sunnier compared to
Saturday with not as significant of a marine push Sunday morning.
Highs will be a touch warmer Saturday/Sunday with the clearer
skies - will peak Sunday with temps reaching upper 60s to mid 70s
(warmest temperatures from metro Seattle south along the I-5
corridor). Lows will remain comfortable with a few more low 50s
Sunday night (otherwise lots of 40s and potentially a few South
Interior locations getting close to dropping in the 30s Sunday
morning).

By Monday, another shortwave trough and weak front will approach
from the west, and begin to increase the chance of showers Monday
afternoon/evening along the coast. Amounts are expected to be
light. Cloud coverage will remain partly cloudy/sunny through
Monday with clouds increasing along the coast. Temperatures are
expected to remain steady from Sunday.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The low offshore will remain
in place through much of next week. It does not appear (based on
ensembles) that it will move inland until Friday of next week. The
front/trough approaching Monday will continue into Tuesday with
shower chances increasing across the region Tuesday into
Wednesday. Amounts at this time will be light (hit or miss showers
expected). There is also a 10-15% chance of thunder in the north
(Whatcom County), however at this point, the best chance of
thunder is over the border into Canada (but this may shift
as more guidance comes in). Another round of showers is possible
Friday as the low is expected to move inland by then. Highs again
will remain steady and right around normal through the week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A mix bag of ceilings this afternoon across Western
Washington between VFR and MVFR. Terminals have been struggling to
scatter this afternoon. Conditions still expected to improve into
VFR later this evening/tonight for all the terminals. Another round
of low stratus is expected Saturday morning, which will bring down
ceilings down to MVFR. The low ceilings will be limited to the coast
and Puget Sound terminals, so terminals to the north (KCLM and
KBLI), will likely remain VFR throughout the TAF period. Generally
SW flow 4-7 kt along the interior, with the exception of KPAE. Winds
for KPAE are expected to shift northerly this afternoon. Winds along
the coast and Strait will be more W/SW around 7-12 kt.

KSEA...Conditions have been slow to improve this afternoon at the
terminal into VFR. Not expecting conditions to completely scatter
this afternoon. VFR conditions this evening/tonight. However,
another push of stratus may drop ceilings to MVFR around 12z
Saturday, with improvement likely after 18-21z. SW surface flow 5-7
kt will turn more westerly late Saturday morning/early afternoon.
Northerly flow returns Saturday evening.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure will move to the east this weekend
and over the coastal waters. A Small Craft Advisory remains in
effect until 6 PM for the coastal waters for choppy waters. Latest
buoy observations do show a decreasing waveheight trend. Diurnal
westerly pushes will occur every evening in the Strait of Juan de
Fuca (some likely needing the issuance of headlines). Today`s push
looks to remain below 21 kt and have decided to hold off on issuing
a Small Craft Advisory. However, may occasionally see gusts in the
21-25 kt range. Tomorrow`s push down the Strait will be stronger and
will likely need additional headlines as sustained winds will be
around 21-25 kt. A weakening front will move over the coastal waters
on Monday, followed by additional systems next week. Seas will
remain below 10 ft into the weekend and next week.
