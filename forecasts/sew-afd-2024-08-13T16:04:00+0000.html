.PREV DISCUSSION... <span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>/issued 242 AM PDT Tue Aug 13 2024/

.SYNOPSIS...Upper troughing over the region will promote onshore
flow and cooler temperatures today. Isolated showers and thunderstorms
will be possible in the North Cascades near the crest. Brief
ridging will build Wednesday with weak low pressure over the area
on Thursday. An upper low offshore may bring more widespread
precipitation over the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Cool and cloudy weather
continues today with upper level troughing over the Pac NW.
There`s another threat of isolated showers in the North Cascades,
especially near the crest. Thunderstorm chances are higher east of
the crest where instablilty is the greatest. Elsewhere, may see
patchy light rain or drizzle along the coast with dry conditions
in the interior. With a thicker stratus layer in place, temps will
track below average with daytime highs in the 60s to lower 70s.

The trough exits east on Wednesday and heights will build for
slightly warmer weather. Onshore flow will also ease with more
sunbreaks in the afternoon and early evening. Temps will reach the
mid to upper 70s in the interior or just a degree or two shy of
normal. Northwest winds will keep the coast in the 60s.

Weak low pressure sweeps inland on Thursday with little change in
the sensible weather across the lowlands. Up in the mountains,
isolated showers expected over the Cascades with a slight chance
of thunderstorms near the crest. 33

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...An upper level low drifts
down from Canada and spins offshore as we move through Friday, the
weekend, and into early next week. The result is cooler than
average conditions through the period with highs in the 60s to
lower-mid 70s and lows in the 50s. Shower chances increase
Saturday night and Sunday as the low pulls additional moisture
into western WA. 33

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light, variable flow aloft today with an upper trough
over the area. Widespread clouds this morning with continued surface
and mid-level moisture. Generally a mix of VFR/MVFR cigs this
morning, with areas of IFR along the coast. Cigs will slowly improve
for those areas in MVFR into early afternoon, with likely BKN/OVC
for most areas through this evening. Cigs will lower again late
tonight into Wednesday morning. Light S/SW winds.

KSEA...VFR cigs with mid level clouds. BKN mid-level cigs likely
this afternoon into this evening. Cigs will lower towards MVFR late
tonight into Wednesday morning. S/SW winds. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...A 1030mb surface high over the EPAC continues to
bring onshore flow over the area waters. Diurnally driven pushes
down the Strait of Juan de Fuca will occur each evening with the
best chance of SCA winds arriving Thursday night. Mist squeezing out
of marine stratus may reduce visibility at times. Seas will remain
around 3 to 5 ft through the rest of the week.
