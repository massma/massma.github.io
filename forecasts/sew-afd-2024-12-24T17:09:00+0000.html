Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
909 AM PST Tue Dec 24 2024


.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>We`re post-frontal here this morning across western
Washington. Showers are tracking from west to east and continuing
throughout the day with the bulk of the activity over the
mountains. Overall, relatively drier conditions are expected as
we`re in between systems. Forecast highs will top out in the upper
40s to near 50 F. The previous discussion remains below along with
an updated aviation section:<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...Front over the Cascades early this morning will
continue to move east. A little break between systems for most of
day. Rain out ahead of a much stronger system spreading over the
area Christmas with possible high winds over the Northwest
Interior late. Bent back occlusion reaching the coast Thursday
moving northeast through the area for another possible round of
high winds for the coast and Northwest Interior and windy
conditions elsewhere. Weaker systems will move through Western
Washington each day Friday through at least the weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Satellite imagery, surface
observations and doppler radar indicate front has moved through
the interior early this morning and is moving into the Cascades
at 10z/3 am. Back edge of steady rain is just clearing the
Seattle area. Temperatures ahead of the front were in the lower
to mid 50s. At 3 am temperatures have dropped into the mid 40s to
lower 50s.

A bit of a break for the area today with the current front moving
into Eastern Washington this morning and the next front still well
offshore. Satellite imagery does show some cold cumulus offshore
and the air mass will be slightly unstable so will keep a chance
of showers in the forecast. Small chance of a thunderstorm along
the North Coast with the parent low between the north end of
Vancouver Island and Haida Gwaii. Temperatures will not vary much
from the current temperatures with highs a couple of degrees
either side of 50.

Short break in the action continuing tonight with the leading
edge of the rain ahead of the incoming frontal system still
offshore for most of the time. Increasing clouds with the best
chance for rain overnight after midnight. Lows in the upper 30s to
mid 40s.

Wet Christmas day in store with the rain ahead of the frontal
system spreading into the area during the day. Snow levels in the
2500 to 3000 foot range so no white Christmas for the lowlands.
While it might feel like it always rains on Christmas this year
will be the 46th time there has been precipitation on Christmas
day in the 80 years of records at Seattle-Tacoma airport, so just
a little over half the time. Surface low deepening offshore with
winds increasing over the Northwest Interior and Admiralty Inlet
by the end of the afternoon. It is possible sustained winds could
reach 40 mph and a high wind watch will be issued for these areas.
Highs in the mid and upper 40s.

Front stalling over Western Washington Christmas night with rain,
heavy at times, across the area. Windy conditions continuing over
the Northwest Interior and Admiralty Inlet. Easterly gradients
increasing overnight but current solutions show cross Cascade
gradient not falling below -10 mb so no high wind watch for the
foothills at this time. Temperatures remaining pretty steady
overnight.

Thursday`s weather has a chance to be very impactful. Front moving
through the area early with a bent back occlusion ( also known as
a poisonous tail ) developing. Models are having some trouble pin
pointing the track of the bent back feature but there are more
than enough solutions to be concerned especially for the coast.
Current UW MM5 solution has a significant area of sustained 60
knot plus winds right off the coast with these winds barely
weakening as they move inland early Thursday morning. This has the
potential to be the strongest winds along the coast so far this
season with widespread power outages and property damage possible
near the beaches. If the MM5 track is correct there could also be
high winds over the interior as well with the Olympia to
Bellingham gradient increasing quickly to around plus 11 mb
Thursday morning. Surface low associated with the bent back
feature moving down the Strait of Juan de Fuca and then into
Southern British Columbia. Will issue a high wind watch for the
coast for late Wednesday night into early Thursday afternoon and
keep the high wind watch for the Northwest Interior and Admiralty
Inlet going into early Thursday afternoon.

While all this is going on in the lowlands, snow levels around
3000 feet through the event. The winter storm watch for the
Olympics and Cascades beginning Wednesday afternoon remains in
effect for the potential of up to 2 feet of snow through early
Friday morning. With the southwesterly flow aloft Mount Baker has
the best chance to get the most snow in the Cascades during this
event.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...While there are some timing
differences the main message in the extended is a system moving
through Western Washington every day Friday through the weekend
with a possible break sometime Monday. None of these systems look
anywhere near as strong as the one Thursday so just a wet forecast
into the first part of next week. Felton

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest to westerly flow aloft continues as another
upper trough moves towards the Pacific Northwest on Wednesday.
Generally VFR cigs this morning, with cigs primarily ranging 3000 to
5000 feet, along with some areas of clearing. VFR expected for the
majority of today across Western Washington with generally dry
conditions and just a few isolated showers. Cigs will begin to lower
tonight along the coast, and lowering to MVFR for the interior by
midday Wednesday as the next frontal system moves into the area.
Southerly winds will continue into Wednesday, increasing Wednesday
afternoon.

KSEA...VFR cigs continue through Wednesday morning, with periods of
FEW/SCT this afternoon into this evening. Cigs will begin to lower
towards MVFR generally around 19-22z on Wednesday with the next
frontal system. Southerly winds 7 to 12 kts, with a few gusts to 20
kts through today. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...Winds gradually easing in the wake of exiting front. This
has allowed most gales to expire /although the one for the East
Strait will remain until 7 AM PST/...and new SCAs to take their
places. While winds over the coastal waters and East Strait will not
meet SCA criteria throughout the entire run of the headline, the
amount of time meeting criteria exceeded the amount of time it would
not, as such did not want to get too fancy with it and painted
advisory with broad strokes. Additionally, seas over the coastal
waters still running in the 17 to 22 ft range this early morning,
but are still on track to subside a little bit later Tuesday and
into Wednesday.

A stronger frontal system is expected to enter the waters on
Wednesday, with the potential for more widespread gales and the
potential for local storm force gusts over portions of the waters.
This system will bring another round of larger seas, with conditions
again building above 20 feet Wednesday night into Thursday. As such,
an additional High Surf Advisory has been issued. This active
weather pattern will persist as yet another frontal system will move
across the waters this weekend.

.HYDROLOGY...A series of systems will move through Western
Washington through the weekend. The most hydrologically
significant system will be the atmospheric rivers arriving
Christmas into Friday morning. Three to five inches of
precipitation over the Olympics expected during this timeframe.
This will push the Skokomish at least into moderate flood stage (
the river will be barely below flood stage when the precipitation
starts ). The Bogachiel and Satsop will also be under pressure in
this scenario with flooding possible on both rivers Thursday.

While precipitation will be less with the systems after Friday the
lack of much of a break will keep rivers over the Southwest
Interior rising into the weekend. It`s possible the Newaukum,
Skookumchuck at Bucoda and the lower reaches of the Chehalis could
flood beginning Friday with the flood threat continuing into the
weekend.

Rivers across the remainder of the area will also be on the rise
in the next few days but the combination of a little less
precipitation and a little cooler temperatures in the Cascades
will reduce the flood threat for rivers flowing off the Cascades.

With all of the precipitation the landslide threat will continue
to increase into the weekend. Felton
