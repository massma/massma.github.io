Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
225 PM PST Sun Jan 12 2025

.SYNOPSIS...A less active pattern in place across Western
Washington for the start of this week. High pressure builds
aloft, maintaining cool and mostly dry conditions. Morning fog
will develop under the strengthening ridge, until a weak
disturbance arrives late Wednesday or Thursday.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A peek out the window and
a glance at satellite shows clouds breaking up over portions of W WA
this afternoon...far more successfully in the western half of the
CWA, but there are patches of blue sky here in the eastern half too.
Not everything is all clear though as the radar still showing some
weak echoes...mainly a band of light showers/sprinkles moving
southwestward from King county into Pierce. As mentioned in the
morning discussion, these bits of precip emerging from passing
shortwaves along the leading edge of a building trough still over
the Pacific waters. Temps still a little on the cool side, at least
in the interior, with most obs reporting lower 40s. There are some
exceptions though. And then there`s UIL reporting 50 degrees along
the coast.

As ridging intensifies over the region throughout the start of this
week, the pattern will remain generally dry with a persistent risk
for widespread overnight and early morning patchy fog or, at the
very least, some low stratus. With Monday being the first day fully
under the ridge, cannot help but wonder if lingering low level
moisture will make it difficult to break out in the late morning or
early afternoon. Model guidance seems to be leaning this way too, so
have opted to go a little pessimistic with fog hanging on into the
afternoon and even once it lifts, may have some difficulty shaking
the low clouds. This would leave Monday living up to its reputation
of being stereotypically gloomy. Fog will likely return overnight
Monday and early Tuesday morning...but with the ridge in place and
moisture gradually diminishing, the likelihood of development late
Tuesday into Wednesday similarly falls.

A slight warming trend expected through mid-week, but certainly not
anything one would mistake as significant. Highs Monday will range
in the lower to mid 40s and highs Tuesday fall within the same range
with most spots only seeing a degree or two of difference. Highs
Wednesday will get a little closer to seasonal normals, ranging from
the mid 40s to around 50. Overnight lows will be quite brisk,
ranging in the lower to mid 30s, with some spots dipping below
freezing.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Increasing clouds overnight
Wednesday into Thursday will likely be the only impact from an upper
level low passing through British Columbia and flattening the ridge
over the Western US. Deterministic models remain consistent only in
their waffling...the GFS now showing better moisture and PoPs
dipping down into the area while the ECMWF has any precip fizzling
out as it plunges southward...these current solutions being
practically the opposite of what they were 24 hours ago. Thankfully,
ensembles remain right on track and thoroughly unimpressed by this
feature, maxing any possible PoPs at 17 pct with a mean
significantly below that at less than 5 pct. It appears that the NBM
is allowing itself to be colored by the deterministic outliers with
20-40 pct PoPs for the lowlands and up to 70 pct in the Cascades.
This seems a touch excessive, but this still remains a ways out yet,
so grab the syrup as there are likely many more waffles to come.
Friday sees the ridge rebuild, allowing for dry, calm conditions to
return for the upcoming weekend.

Highs will see a minor cooling trend, starting off ranging in the
mid to upper 40s Thursday before finding themselves in the upper 30s
to lower 40s for the weekend. Overnight lows will similarly fall,
starting off in the lower to mid 30s Thursday night before bottoming
out in the mid to upper 20s for the weekend.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper ridge will remain over Western Washington
through Monday for continued northerly flow aloft. Generally
MVFR/VFR cigs this afternoon with low to mid clouds. MVFR/VFR will
continue into this evening with some clearing in spots to FEW/SCT.
Cigs will lower tonight between 07-10z towards LIFR/IFR across Puget
Sound. In addition, fog development is expected due to abundant
moisture at the surface and light flow at the surface. LIFR
cigs/vsbys will then continue through Monday morning for the
majority of the interior sites. Some improvement is expected to
vsbys Monday afternoon, however, LIFR/IFR cigs may continue for some
areas of central and southern Puget Sound through the afternoon.
Lighter N/NE winds will continue through this evening becoming light
and variable tonight into Monday.

KSEA...MVFR cigs continue this afternoon. Brief improvements to VFR
are possible this evening, mainly between 02-06z as clouds scatter
further. LIFR/IFR cigs will then develop tonight between 07-10z.
Vsbys reduction are also expected Monday morning due to fog
development. LIFR cigs/vsbys are forecast to continue through midday
Monday. Some improvements in cigs and vsbys are possible Monday
afternoon, however, confidence remains low in clearing or VFR cigs
Monday PM due to light flow at the surface. North winds of 4 to 7
kts will continue into this evening, with a brief period of
sustained winds near 10 kts possible between 00z and 03z. Otherwise,
light, variable winds Monday morning. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will build over the waters into Monday and
remain over the waters for the majority of the week. A weak front
will move through the area Thursday into Friday for increasing
northerly winds. Small Craft Advisory north winds will need to be
monitored during this period for the Coastal Waters. NE winds will
then develop next weekend.

Seas will range 8 to 12 feet over the Coastal Waters tonight into
Monday morning. Seas will then briefly subside below 10 feet Monday
afternoon into Monday night before building again on Tuesday to near
10 feet for the Outer Coastal Waters. Seas will subside below 10
feet later Wednesday before building to 10 to 12 feet Thursday. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
