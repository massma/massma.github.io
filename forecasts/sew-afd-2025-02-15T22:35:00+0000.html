Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
235 PM PST Sat Feb 15 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system will continue to bring widespread
precipitation across the region through the weekend, including
lowland rain, and heavy snow in the Cascades. Expect the unsettled
wet pattern to continue through the week, with the chance for
another organized system on Wednesday. Temperatures will slowly
warm up through the week, with highs reaching the low 50s by the
end of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper air analysis shows a
ridge breaking apart over western WA this afternoon, giving way to
an upper level low/trough over the northeast Pacific. There is a
jet core on the lee side of the trough, funneling moisture down
into southwest WA/OR. IVT analysis characterizes a small moisture
pool embedded within the trough beginning to dissipate into
Sunday/Monday. Not quite the strength of a full on atmospheric
river, but any kind of extra moisture will help juice the
atmosphere for the precipitation through the weekend. Compared to
previous systems that were drier/colder, this will be the first
good dose of QPF over the region in a bit, with totals still
expected to range from 0.50-0.75 inches in the lowlands, and
1-1.25 inches along the coast. There were significant increases in
the Cascades and Olympics, with the Olympics up to 1.5-2.5 inches
today through Monday, and Cascades receiving 1.5-3.0 inches of
QPF.

There is still however (even 24-48 hours out) quite a large range
in ensembles in precipitation totals through the weekend (they
vary as much as a quarter of an inch). This mostly comes from the
slight perturbations in the track of the low/trough. While a
quarter of an inch spread does not seem too significant, this will
ultimately have somewhat of an effect on snow amounts forecasted
in the Cascades through the long weekend. The HREF grand ensemble
still has a majority of members agreeing on winter storm warning
amounts of snow between now and Monday (mean is just shy of around
20 inches at Snoqualmie and Stevens Passes through Monday
morning). There is a 75% chance of at least a foot of snow at both
passes during this time, so with that confidence, will keep the
headlines in place through the weekend for heavy snow in the
Cascades above 2,500 ft. The most impactful times will be Sunday
and Monday morning, where cool air aloft/post frontal convergence
with west winds may enhance some heavier snow rates of 0.5-1
inch/hour.

Snow levels will slowly rise to above 3,500 ft into Monday
afternoon, which will start to mix some rain in Monday afternoon
in the passes. There is a low risk of wintry mix in between the
rain/snow areas, but the risk will decrease into Monday once
warm sector moves through. Precipitation amounts will decrease
Monday afternoon into Tuesday, with another round of rain likely
along the coast Tuesday with the next frontal system approaching
from the west. Highs in the short term will be the coolest this
afternoon (mid 40s in the lowlands, and upper 20s/30s in the
mountains). Expect a warm up Sunday/Monday with more upper 40s,
and potentially some 50s going into Tuesday.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...The previously mentioned
frontal system Tuesday will continue into Wednesday, with
widespread precipitation chances continuing through Thursday
morning. Snow levels right now appear highest in Puget
Sound/Pacific coast/Olympic areas with increases above 4,000 ft.
Cascades will remain around 2,000 ft, but QPF/snow totals remain
below winter weather advisory level for any snow in the mountains
midweek. Ensembles show above average chances of precipitation and
warmer temperatures continuing into next week/weekend, with some
hints of possible heavy QPF next weekend. Highs in the low/mid 50s
is possible by next weekend (a bit above average for this time in
February).
