Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
900 AM PDT Wed Jul 24 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Upper level trough over Western Washington through
Thursday. Weak system moving through today will be dry with
increasing onshore flow behind the system tonight. The trough will
move off to the northeast Thursday night. A weaker trough will
take its place over the weekend into the first part of next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The current forecast remains
on track with no planned updates this morning. 33

Previous discussion...Weak shortwave spinning around the trough
moving through later today. This feature is dry with just some
middle level clouds moving through the area. Increasing onshore
flow this afternoon will keep temperatures from warming too much
even with the late July sunshine. Highs in the 70s for the
interior and mid and upper 60s for the coast.

Low level onshore flow tonight with a convergence zone setting up
over Snohomish county. Could see light showers/drizzle under the
zone overnight. Also a slight chance of showers over the North
Cascades as what is left of the shortwave exits the area. Under
mostly cloudy skies lows will be in the 50s.

Onshore flow weakening Thursday with the low level flow turning
northerly in the afternoon. Upper level trough axis moving through
combined with the onshore flow keeping skies mostly cloudy in the
morning. Skies clearing Thursday afternoon with the weakening
onshore flow and trough axis over the Cascades. Cloud cover in the
morning plus a little cooler temperatures aloft with the trough
axis overhead will keep highs in the mid 60s to mid 70s.

Upper level trough moving off to the northeast Thursday night.
Weak low level onshore flow developing overnight. The onshore flow
will not be strong enough to drive the marine layer very far
inland leaving skies mostly clear overnight. Lows in the upper 40s
to mid 50s.

Friday a transition day with the upper level trough well to the
northeast and a weaker upper level trough beginning to develop
late in the day. Once again the low level onshore flow will not be
strong enough to push the marine layer inland. Highs near normal,
70s and lower 80s inland and mid 60s to lower 70s coast.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement with a weak upper level trough over the area for the
weekend and low level onshore flow. This will give the area a
couple days of normal late July weather. Onshore flow could be
strong enough to get the marine layer inland Sunday morning with
skies clearing in the afternoon. Highs in the 70s with lows in the
lower to mid 50s.

Model consistency falls apart Monday and Tuesday. The operational
ECMWF has an upper level trough moving down the British Columbia
coast Monday with an upper level low closing up off the coast
Monday night and Tuesday. The operational GFS has a shortwave
moving through Monday with a flat upper level ridge building
Tuesday. While the ECMWF ensembles are not as strong with the low
there is still a very wet signal for Monday afternoon through
Tuesday with over half of the ensemble solutions indicating
measurable rain. The GFS ensembles have a much weaker signal with
less than 20 percent of the ensemble solutions indicating
measurable precipitation. Fun fact, there has not been measurable
rain in Seattle between July 27th and August 1st in the last 15
years. In addition using the combined record between the Federal
Building in downtown Seattle and Seattle-Tacoma airport there has
been measurable rain on July 30th only 9 times since 1894. Given
the climatology will go more with the GFS solution and only have
slight chance pops for Monday and Tuesday. Highs remaining in the
70s inland and 60s along the coast. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level trough over the area with southwesterly
flow aloft. Trough axis moving through tonight with flow aloft
becoming west northwesterly behind the trough axis. In the lower
levels onshore flow increasing late this afternoon into tonight
then weakening Thursday.

MVFR ceilings along the coast with some high clouds over the
Northwest Interior. Clear skies over the remainder of the area
this morning. Increasing high level clouds over the remainder of
the area this afternoon and evening with MVFR ceilings continuing
along the coast.

MVFR ceilings developing over Snohomish County tonight with weak
convergence zone. MVFR ceilings continuing along the coast with
VFR ceilings elsewhere. Ceilings improving to VFR all areas mid to
late Thursday morning.

KSEA...Clear skies with increasing high clouds later this
afternoon. Ceilings lowering overnight but staying VFR through
Thursday morning. West southwest winds 4 to 6 knots becoming
