Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
155 PM PDT Sun Oct 6 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The sunny and warming trend will peak on Monday as a
trough works its way southward from B.C. into the region. Light
rain chances spread across the area Monday night into Tuesday, and
remain through Wednesday. A brief break in precipitation is
expected Thursday. Additional rain chances are possible late week
into the weekend and another warming trend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A rather pleasant fall
day in western Washington today with temperatures in the upper
50s to low 60s and mostly clear skies. A few high clouds will pass
overhead. Clear conditions continue tonight with fog and low
stratus reforming along the coast and in the low spots and river
valleys through the interior, similar to what occurred this
morning. Lows should be a touch warmer, in the low to mid 40s.

A weak upper level trough currently overhead will move off to the
east into Monday, allowing for a trough to move southeastward from
British Columbia closer to the region. This will allow for chances
of rain to begin in the northwestern-most portions of the area
Monday afternoon into Monday evening. Most of western Washington
will remain partly cloudy throughout the day, allowing for Monday
to be the warmest day of the week, with highs reaching the upper
60s to mid 70s.

The front will continue to slowly drift southward on Tuesday and
weaken as it does so. Chances for rain showers are expected on
Tuesday, but amounts will be light. Overall, less than a tenth of
an inch of rain is expected, with the highest amounts (up to a
quarter to a half of an inch of rain) over the northwestern part
of the Olympic Peninsula.

The patter remains with a broad trough over the eastern Pacific
with several waves moving through it. Chances for light rain will
continue into Wednesday but not amount to much; chances taper
throughout the day.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...A weak ridge builds over
the area on Thursday, providing a break in the precipitation
chances. Following, the patter evolution becomes more uncertain
with larger spread amongst model ensemble members. The general
pattern favors a longwave trough over the eastern Pacific with a
ridge over the intermountain west. Depending on the placement and
amplitude of these features, this could allow systems to work
their way into western Washington, bringing additional rain
chances. Many members, however, remain dry through the weekend.
The mean solution also favors a warming trend, with temperatures
warming back up into the mid to upper 60s, even perhaps the low
70s again in some spots.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>VFR this afternoon with passing high clouds, except for
areas of MVFR low stratus along the coast. Winds will remain
generally out of the S/SW 7 kt or less today. Another marine push
early Monday morning will likely bring in another round of MVFR to
IFR low stratus and patchy fog.

KSEA...VFR with light SW winds generally 7 kt or less. Another
morning of MVFR to IFR fog is likely early Monday morning, with
forecast models showing a 30% chance of ceilings falling below 500
ft and a 10% to 15% chance of degraded visibility through roughly
18z.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure over the coastal waters will
continue today shifting closer to the coast. This will allow for
southerlies to develop over the coastal waters and south to
southwesterly winds over the interior waters by this afternoon. A
dissipating cold front will bring borderline SCA level winds to the
coastal waters on Monday, though models continue to keep conditions
just below criteria thresholds. Another weak system is on track to
follow mid-week.

Seas 3 to 5 ft will gradually rise throughout the day, peaking at 7
to 9 ft by the start of Monday before subsiding slightly to 6 to 8
ft Monday evening, where they will remain into mid-week.
