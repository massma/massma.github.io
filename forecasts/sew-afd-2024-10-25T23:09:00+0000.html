National Weather Service Seattle WA
409 PM PDT Fri Oct 25 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Dry, mild conditions this afternoon and early evening
will transition to unsettled weather with gusty winds and
widespread rain moving into the area late in the evening into
Saturday morning. A second system will bring more widespread rain
and breezy conditions again Saturday Night into Sunday - with a
good chance of thunderstorms during the day - and mountain snow
late in the afternoon. The overall pattern looks to remain active
next week - with a relative break early followed by active and
cooler weather after mid week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Today`s brief upper-
ridging is already being nudged to the east ahead of a Pacific
frontal system on track to move onshore overnight. Mild afternoon
temperatures, calm winds and even a little sunshine will give way
to increasing mid to high level clouds through the early evening.

Widespread rain ahead of a 990 surface low will begin to
spread onshore late this evening and spread inland overnight.
Guidance consistently has the surface low tracking into Central Vancouver
Island by 12Z Saturday morning. The track of this low will spread
strong southerly winds onto the coast late in the evening and
building through the interior - especially Whidbey Island
northward through the San Juan Islands and Western Whatcom and
Skagit Counties. High resolution ensemble guidance showing 60-80%
chance of sustained winds greater than 30mph, and a 90-100%
chance of gusts > 45mph along the coast. For the Whidbey
Island/Admiralty Inlet area, the San Juans, and Western
Whatcom/Skagit Counties ensembles showing a 40-60% chance of
sustained winds greater than 30mph, and an 80-100% chance of gusts
greater than 45mph. Have issued a wind advisory for those areas
from late this evening into Saturday morning. Impacts may include
power outages along with tree damage and the scattering of
unsecured outdoor objects.

Rainfall is expected to transition to showers throughout the day
on Saturday as the surface low tracks off and away. QPF guidance
with this first system has trended a bit lighter and the impacts
are expected to remain limited to nominal rises on area rivers.
Temperatures will trend slightly cooler as they`ll cap in the mid
50s to lower 60s. A second front remains on track to move through
Saturday evening. This system looks wetter, and less windy -
though will likely bring breezy conditions. For QPF the heaviest
amounts are expected over the North Cascades and Olympics, with
snow levels will remain generally above 4000 feet through Sunday.
There is a 50-60% chance of 3 or more inches of QPF over the
Olympics from Saturday afternoon through Sunday afternoon and a
30-40% chance of 3 or more inches over the North Cascades.
Precipitation accumulations for much of the interior lowlands will
be in the 0.75 to 1.00 inch range, and up 2 inches along the coast
Saturday afternoon through Sunday evening. In addition to the
rainfall, cooler temperatures aloft with the passing upper level
trough on Sunday will bring a 15-20% chance of thunderstorms to
much of Western Washington. Highs will continue to trend cooler
as values cap within the 50s. Overnight lows are to remain in the
40s and 50s throughout the short term.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...A broad upper-level trough
will linger early in the week with showers and lower snow levels
around 4000 feet. Light snowfall is a distinct possibility for
higher elevations as showers linger the forecast. Conditions may
trend drier on Tuesday then shift back to cooler and active
midweek and beyond the large scale pattern sets up to send a
series of storms through the remaining extended period.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface flow becoming increasingly southerly this
afternoon as the next frontal system continues to approach.A period
of gusty winds and shower activity will spread across the region
overnight into Saturday, with lowest ceilings (down toward 2500
feet, locally down to IFR along the coast. Expect the windiest
locations to be along the coast and north interior. Expect improving
conditions later Saturday morning, but conditions will again
deteriorate again Saturday night into Sunday morning as another
system moves through.

KSEA...VFR conditions with northwest surface winds this afternoon,
switching to southerly around 6 kt later this evening ahead of an
approaching frontal system.  Ceilings will lower, showers will
develop, and gusts will become more prevalent overnight after 07z. A
brief period of improvement is possible Saturday morning through mid
afternoon before deteriorating again Saturday late afternoon and
evening.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong front will approach the local waters this
evening as the associated low remains centered offshore. Expect
increasing southerly winds as this low continues to pass by on a
path toward Vancouver Island. Expect  bust frontal system will start
to approach the area waters this afternoon, with southerly winds
increasing over waters. Initial SCAs cover this transition, with
gale warnings now in effect for the coastal waters, Strait of Juan
de Fuca, Admiralty Inlet, and North Interior Waters late tonight
through early Saturday. Meanwhile, an advisory has been issued for
the Puget Sound and Hood Canal zone as southerlies increase ahead of
the front.

Seas will build significantly over the coastal waters by
early Saturday, reaching close to 15 ft over the outer coastal
waters. Expect seas mostly 10 to 14 feet to remain through Saturday.
Seas over the coastal waters will again increase toward 17 ft early
next week behind the next frontal system, and will remain elevated
through at least the first half of next week.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system will move into Western Washington
tonight with unsettled weather, and periods of steadier
precipitation, through Monday. Snow levels will rise to 7000 to
8000 feet on Saturday, before falling to near 4000 feet on Monday.
QPF totals during this period are expected to range 2 to 4 inches
across the Olympics and Cascades, leading to a rise in area
rivers. At this time, river flooding is not expected. However,
rivers will continue to be monitored, particularly the Skokomish
River this weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
