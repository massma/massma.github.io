Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
407 PM PST Thu Feb 6 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cold temperatures will settle into the region by
Friday morning as the upper trough pushes inland over the Pacific
Northwest. A weak system will bring additional chances of snow
showers to the area over the weekend. Cool temperatures and
periodic chances of snow showers will persist into next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Conditions will continue to
dry out today as the upper level trough that has been producing
snow showers across western Washington finally exits the region to
the southeast. Clouds will continue to thin out throughout the
rest of the afternoon and evening, giving way to mostly clear
skies. Additionally, with snow cover in place, overnight
temperatures will drop into the teens to mid 20s across the
lowlands, with wind chills dipping as low as 10 degrees from
Bellingham northward. A Cold Weather Advisory remains in place
for much of the interior lowlands for Friday morning, which will
be the coldest morning of the week. Any lingering moisture from
melting snow will also refreeze overnight, resulting in areas of
ice that may cause slippery conditions during the Friday morning
commute.

Weak ridging will pass over western Washington on Friday,
providing us with dry conditions ahead of the next incoming
system. Increasing cloud cover throughout the day Friday will
limit highs to the upper 30s and lower 40s.

A shortwave embedded in a longwave trough will pass over western
Washington late Friday into Saturday, stirring up another round
of scattered showers. Precipitation will spread inland from the
coast by the late evening, filling in across much of the region
throughout the overnight hours and into the morning Saturday.
Forecast models show a wide range of solutions with this system,
with uncertainty over the timing and location of showers, as well
as temperatures which will largely influence precipitation type
and accumulation amounts. Temperatures will also be warmer over
the weekend with lows across the lowlands in the upper 20s to
lower 30s and highs in the upper 30s to lower 40s, so much of the
incoming precipitation may fall as a wintry mix or even rain.
Ensembles highlight the highest potential for accumulating snow
over higher terrain, while the lowlands may see some brief snow on
Saturday that melts fairly quickly. Moist northwest flow will
develop aloft on Sunday, with potential for some flurries and
light drizzle over the region but accumulations will be mostly
limited to the mountains.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Forecast models show strong
agreement for a positively tilted trough passing over the Pacific
Northwest by Monday afternoon. This will reintroduce cooler
temperatures into the region, with lows falling once again into
the teens to low 20s for the lowlands. Depending on the exact
placement and amplitude of this troughing, temperatures will
could end up anywhere from below average to exceptionally cold.
Heading into the rest of next week, large variations in the
forecast remain. While models remain uncertain on exact outcomes
at this time, ensemble products reflect high confidence in
extended cold conditions across western Washington. By the end of
the forecast period, ridging across the eastern Pacific may break
down, leading to increased precipitation chances across the area.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Improvement continues across Western Washington with the
majority of terminals now in MVFR conditions. Expecting conditions
to continue to improve later this afternoon/evening towards VFR. Low

to 6 kt late tonight into Friday morning. Winds will eventually
shift south/southwesterly late Friday morning/early afternoon with
speeds of 4 to 7 knots. Moreover, northeasterly surface flow is
expected to continue along KBLI, and high-resolution guidance is
indicating that gusts will pick up between 4Z to 16Z, with gusts
between 20 to 23 kt.

.KSEA...Currently MVFR as some clouds have began to move southward
into the terminal. Expecting some improvement late tonight into the
early morning hours with VFR that are are expected to persist for
the majority of the TAF period.

North/northeasterly winds 10 to 15 knots expected to begin subsiding
around 9Z-15Z Friday. Winds will shift southerly/southwesterly

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface trough over the coastal waters will gradually
move over the coastal waters Friday through the weekend bringing an
increase in winds late Saturday night into early Sunday morning, but
should remain below small craft criteria, according to guidance.
Waves are expected to remain below 10 ft through next week; combined
seas this weekend will be around 3 to 5 ft. They will build to 4 to
