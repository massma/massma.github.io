Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
344 AM PDT Sun May 5 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cool and unsettled conditions continue across the
region early this week. A shift in the pattern toward midweek with
bring about dry conditions and steadily warming temperatures
through the second half of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A mild start to the day
across the region with temperatures generally in the lower 50s at
this hour and rather damp with low stratus or fog present through
the interior this morning. Shower activity has diminished a bit as
the low begins to drift away, but some moisture does continue to
wrap around and move across the southern portions of the area
(generally from Olympia southward). Expect some showers to
continue this morning with an increase later in the day as
stronger onshore flow develops as the next trough approaches.
Expect primarily rain through the interior, though some light snow
will be possible above around 4500 feet and especially in the
higher Cascade elevations.

A stronger upper level trough approaches and moves into the region
on Monday. As cooler air aloft pushes into the region, steepening
lapse rates will increase the potential for isolated thunderstorms
through the day on Monday. Strong onshore flow will develop with
a Puget Sound Convergence Zone likely to develop into the
afternoon and evening. While snow levels will dip a bit closer to
the Cascade passes, the most significant threat for strong showers
will be under the PSCZ, especially if it`s able to push into the
mountains.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Ensemble guidance
continues to depict high confidence in a shift to a much warmer
pattern through the second half of the week as a strong ridge
builds over the western U.S. starting around midweek. Still some
variations evident in the clusters of ensemble members with
respect to where the ridge axis sets up and just how strong it is,
but confidence is high in seeing temperatures climb to at least
10 to 15 degrees above normal by the late stages of the week for
much of the lowlands. Current forecast from the NBM suggest a run
into the lower to mid 80s is possible for the warmest spots
Saturday. While the precise temperature forecast will fluctuate a
bit in the coming days, it`s worth noting that this will be a
significant warm up and coupled with the calendar turning to May,
many folks may be out around area water. Keep in mind that local
waters are still quite cool and be sure to adhere to safety
practices if you`re out in or around the water later this week.
