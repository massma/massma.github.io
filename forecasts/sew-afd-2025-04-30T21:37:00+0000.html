Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
237 PM PDT Wed Apr 30 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will build into the region through
Thursday for warmer and drier conditions across western
Washington. Chances of showers will return later on Friday as the
next system moves into the region. Unsettled conditions will
persist into the weekend ahead of a drying and warming trend
early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge of
high pressure will continue to shift inland through Thursday,
bringing warmer and drier conditions to western Washington. Skies
will continue to clear throughout the afternoon, allowing for
temperatures to peak in the upper 50s along the coast and in the
60s across the lowlands.

A warming trend will continue into Thursday as the upper ridge
axis shifts onshore. Lingering low level moisture may produce some
areas of patchy fog early Thursday morning for areas along the
Puget Sound, expected to scatter out by mid morning and giving way
to sunny skies. Afternoon highs will climb another 10 to 15
degrees from today, peaking in the upper 60s along the Pacific
Coast and in the mid to upper 70s for much of the lowlands. Areas
south of the Olympics, including Montesano and the Chehalis River
Valley may see highs reach the low 80s, alongside some spots along
the Cascade foothills and valleys. Temperatures Thursday will be
warm enough for widespread Minor (Yellow) HeatRisk.

Southerly flow will develop aloft on Friday as a trough approaches
the coast and the high pressure ridge moves off to the east.
Temperatures along the coast will cool as cloud cover increases,
with temperatures remaining elevated in the upper 60s to low 70s
across the interior. This will maintain Minor HeatRisk for
lowlands east of the Puget Sound on Friday. A weak frontal system
is on track to bring the next chance of showers to western
Washington on Friday, with a band of showers reaching the coast by
the afternoon and spreading inland overnight into Saturday. Areas
east of the Olympics will likely see rain shadowing as the system
moves eastward. The trough will break apart as it moves inland on
Saturday, with split flow developing towards the latter half of
the weekend. Lingering post- frontal showers Saturday will taper
off throughout the day over higher terrain. Rainfall amounts will
be light as this system moves across western Washington, with most
areas seeing a tenth of an inch of rain or less. Troughing will
cause temperatures to fall several degrees below normal on
Saturday, with highs peaking in the mid 50s to low 60s.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Split flow will pass
overhead on Sunday and bring in a drier air mass as a cutoff low
develops over the desert Southwest and high pressure builds
offshore. Light showers may linger over the northern Cascades on
Sunday with little in the way of accumulation.

Forecast model solutions start to diverge by early next week, with
operational models amplifying a ridge onshore and favoring warmer
and drier conditions while some ensemble members hang onto
troughing with a cooler and wetter solution. A slight chance for
high elevation showers has been maintained into early next week,
with warmer temperatures favored to return and potential for
additional Minor HeatRisk across the lowlands. Ensembles and
deterministic forecast models are both in good agreement over
chances for precipitation increasing into the middle of next week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper-ridge is centering over the region this evening
and remain overhead into Thursday. Northerly winds tonight will
transition more west-southwesterly by early Thursday as the ridge
axis cuts into W WA. Primarily VFR is in the forecast for all
terminals throughout the period. However, patchy fog is likely to
develop into early Thursday morning as vicinity fog can`t be ruled
out for a few airfields. Latest HREF guidance indicates a 40-50%
probability of RH values greater than 95% near terminals such as
KOLM and KPAE. If fogs develops, it should subside by 15z Thursday
to VFR conditions.

KSEA...VFR expected throughout the period. Patchy fog is possible to
develop across Puget Sound Thursday morning but as of now, the
airfield is likely to steer clear of it. NW-N winds between 5 to 10
kt becoming lighter overnight.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>1025 mb surface high resides offshore as an upper-ridge
amplifies across the region. Benign winds and seas tonight through
Thursday. However, a weakening front will enter on Friday with
increased onshore flow. This will likely lead to a period of
headlines, mainly in the form of SCAs for winds across the coastal
waters and Strait of Juan de Fuca. Onshore flow will continue into
Saturday before easing Sunday as a ridge rebuilds across the waters
into Monday.
