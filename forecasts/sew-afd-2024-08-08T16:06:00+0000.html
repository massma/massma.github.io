Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
906 AM PDT Thu Aug 8 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Temperatures will warm well above normal through
Friday before some cooling over the weekend. Areas of lofted smoke
and haze are expected into the weekend with mid-level east flow. A
chance of isolated thunderstorms exists over the mountains each
afternoon through Saturday, with the best potential Friday. Cooler
conditions arrive into next week.

.UPDATE...Increasing haze aloft this morning through Puget Sound
will linger throughout much of the day. There is still much
uncertainty in how warm it will get today due to the haze/smoke
aloft, therefore, have bumped temperatures down a touch with this
morning update to reflect the uncertainty.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Mostly clear skies over
Western Washington early this morning with stratus along the coast
and into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. In addition, haze is
increasing aloft this morning due to increasing mid-level easterly
flow. East flow at 850/925mb today will warm temperatures rather
significantly into the 80s and low 90s. There continues to remain
some uncertainty in the temperature forecast given the increasing
haze/smoke aloft, but despite the haze, temperatures will be very
warm. This trend continues into Friday with a similar pattern,
with temperatures for the interior perhaps a degree or two warmer.
HeatRisk levels are widespread Moderate through Friday, with
isolated areas of Major HeatRisk along the Cascade Foothills and
into the metro area of King County. For this reason, a Heat
Advisory continues for a good portion of Western Washington, other
than the coast, through Friday. Increasing onshore flow is
expected on Saturday, allowing for some cooling, with temperatures
in the 80s for the interior and 60s to low 70s along the coast.
Westerly flow will slowly begin to clear the haze, but will likely
linger into the weekend.

In addition to the heat/haze, there is a threat for isolated
thunderstorms over the next few days, particularly over the North
Cascades due to increasing instability. At this time, Friday is
expected to have the best potential of thunderstorms over the
Cascades, with even a slight chance over the Olympics as well.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Troughing will begin to
influence the Pacific Northwest Sunday into next week, allowing
for a cooling trend during this period. Although some uncertainty
exists in the extent of troughing over the area, ensembles are
generally consistent in more of a troughing pattern. Although
precipitation potential remains low during this period, increasing
onshore flow will bring additional clouds, with perhaps morning
drizzle at times. Temperature early to middle of next week are
expected to be slightly below normal. JD

.AVIATION...Northwest flow aloft with upper-level ridging just
offshore. Marine stratus is gradually moving inland given current
satellite imagery. LIFR cigs and vis are along the coast & strait
(KUIL, KHQM, & KCLM) at this time. NBM v4.2 has a 10-20% chance of
IFR to LIFR conditions making its way to interior terminals with the
best chance occuring for sites such as KPWT and KOLM. Any lingering
stratus should clear by 18z. Haze from smoke aloft looks to move
over the region this afternoon. An additional round of stratus looks
to arrive overnight into Friday morning.

KSEA...VFR conditions at the airfield currently. Marine stratus at
the coast has a 10-15% chance of making it to the terminal between
12-16z. If manifest, stratus should clear out by 18z but haze from
nearby wildfires is expected with some reduction to vis. Light winds
increasing to 7-12 kt during the afternoon becoming lighter again
overnight.

.MARINE...Broad surface high pressure to remain offshore and lower
pressure inland will maintain onshore flow in varying degrees.
Benign conditions are present for all marine zones through Friday
morning. However, a round of SCA winds are possible to develop
Friday afternoon/evening for the central and eastern strait and
again over the weekend. Persistent northwest winds will continue
over the outer coastal waters, maintaining steep seas generally
around 4 to 6 feet.

.FIRE WEATHER...Upper level ridging will bring warmer
temperatures and mostly drier conditions through the rest of the
week. Weak offshore flow is expected in the Cascade valleys
through Friday bringing isolated areas of lower RHs, along with
unstable conditions. At this time, conditions do not appear
widespread enough to for a Red Flag Warning, but elevated
conditions are expected.

Instability will increase this afternoon as a weak disturbance
clips the Canadian border, which may trigger some isolated
thunderstorm development along the North Cascades. The particular
area we are monitoring is mainly the northern portion of zone 658
near the Canadian border. Thunderstorm probabilities increase on
Friday afternoon over the Cascades (20-30%) and perhaps even the
Olympics (10-20%), with a lower potential for thunderstorms on
Saturday. This threat of convection will continued to be monitored
given the potential for lightning strikes to spark new fires. JD
