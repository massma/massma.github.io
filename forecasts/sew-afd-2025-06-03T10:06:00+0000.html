Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
306 AM PDT Tue Jun 3 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper ridge will remain over the eastern Pacific
through the week with generally dry conditions and near to
slightly above normal temperatures. A pair of passing
disturbances briefly bring extra clouds and possible drizzle
near the coast. Temperatures are expected to trend warmer late
in the weekend through the start of next week as the upper ridge
moves onshore.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Strong high pressure remains
anchored in the eastern Pacific through the next several days.
This will maintain generally dry and mild conditions across the
region through midweek, though a weak passing disturbance Wednesday
will likely clip the region and chance the onshore flow. This
will knock a few degrees off of the high temperatures, increase
the cloud cover across the region Wednesday morning, and
perhaps even bring some light drizzle along the coast.
Temperatures reach the lower 70s in the warmest spots Tuesday,
but a few degrees cooler Wednesday. With weaker onshore flow and
the ridge more squarely building overhead, Thursday is likely
the warmest of the three with afternoon readings peaking in the
upper 70s for most of the region.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...In a bit of a
repeat of Wednesday, Friday will likely feature another
shortwave disturbance passing across the region. This will
induce deeper onshore flow and bring more widespread clouds and
cooler afternoon temperatures. Ensemble guidance remains in
strong agreement with respect to the ridge building eastward
into the early portion of next week. This would bring afternoon
high temperatures increasing into the 80s for the start of next
week from around Seattle southward. This would correspond to
another round of moderate (Orange) HeatRisk values for next
weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest flow aloft continues with an upper ridge
centered well offshore. The air mass is dry and stable. VFR will
continue areawide into this evening with the exception of some IFR
or low MVFR stratus along the coast and locally into the Chehalis
Gap this morning. Increasing low level onshore flow tonight will
push a marine layer into the interior with low MVFR stratus expected
throughout Puget Sound 12Z-20Z on Wednesday.

KSEA...VFR continues into this evening. Increasing onshore flow
tonight will bring low MVFR stratus into the terminal by 12Z-15Z
Wednesday morning. Surface winds light and variable early will
become W/NW 5 to 9 knots this afternoon. Winds will back to
southwesterly tonight.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface ridge will remain centered around 900
nautical miles offshore through much of the week ahead. Weak
systems passing north of the ridge will lead to varying
degrees of onshore flow.

Small craft advisories remain in effect into tonight for the outer
coastal waters for a combination of gusty northwest winds and steep
seas. A weak system passing to the north of the area late today will
act to increase onshore flow enough to produce small craft advisory
strength westerlies in the central and east strait late this
afternoon into tonight.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
