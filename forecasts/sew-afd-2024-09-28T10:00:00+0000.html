Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
300 AM PDT Sat Sep 28 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Drier conditions today as zonal flow aloft
continues. A subtle trough will enter western Washington Sunday
increasing precipitation chances. An upper level ridge set up to
start the new week, however a series of weak troughs will influence
the pattern. Most precipitation should stay north of the area.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Current satellite imagery
showing some high clouds passing over W WA this early morning with
most obs sites not showing anything in the way of low clouds,
stratus or fog...save for over portions of Whidbey Island. Looking
at temp/dewpoint spreads, there is the hint that this might not be
the case throughout the remainder of the morning, as that split is
only one or two degrees in some spots. Inherited forecast carved out
an area of patchy fog running from the SW interior up northeastward
along the Sound and am inclined to leave that risk stand through
late this morning.

Otherwise, pretty uneventful weather-wise today. Zonal flow aloft
shifting southwesterly in advance of a weak upper level trough
progged to traverse the area Sunday. For today, that means
increasing clouds and slightly cooler temperatures. Daytime highs
expected generally in the lower to mid 60s for most lowland
locations, although some water-adjacent spots may find themselves a
little cooler than that in the upper 50s. As the weak trough passes
Sunday, any potential for precip should remain from Everett north
east of the Sound and perhaps just nicking the north coast on the
Olympic Peninsula. Monday sees upper level ridging return bringing
clearing skies and the possibility for slightly warmer temperatures
for the SW interior...with highs in the mid to upper 60s. The
remainder of the area may see a slight nudge upward as well...but
not enough to get the lowlands out of the lower to mid 60s.
Overnight lows in the near term will certainly feel autumn-like,
generally in the lower to mid 40s.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The upper ridge will flatten
out as Tuesday rolls around, thanks to an upper level low moving
southward from the Gulf of Alaska. Deterministic models in
disagreement with the GFS keeping any precip north of the border for
the midweek period running Tuesday through Thursday, however the
ECMWF brings a swathe of moisture into W WA Tuesday night into
Wednesday morning before favoring dry conditions for the remainder
of the day. Ensembles do lean toward the Euro solution, however even
there the resultant precip amounts are very low. As such, NBM in
forecast has finally had its coffee when it comes to this scenario,
with PoPs generally in the 10-30 pct range, a much better reflection
of current solutions when compared to output 24 and 48 hours ago.
This PoPs, unimpressive as they are, will mainly be of interest to
the northern two-thirds of the CWA...with points Tacoma southward
likely to receive nothing. Upper level ridging builds in as early as
Wednesday night, keeping conditions dry for Thursday and much of
Friday. Deterministic models and ensemble members in agreement with
a frontal system associated with an upper low off the Canadian coast
reaching our coastline late Friday afternoon/early Friday evening
with a more convincing shot at precip for the area, although given
that is expected in the day-7 timeframe, NBM rightly maxes PoPs out
around 40 pct for now...enough to warrant some confidence but plenty
of time to move upward or down as solutions likely change.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow continues today as a weak upper
trough approaches the region. Low level northerly flow will turn
onshore this afternoon and increase tonight. Areas of IFR/LIFR in
fog and/or stratus are expected this morning...especially across the
Southwest Interior, south Puget Sound, and outlying river valleys.
This is expected to dissipate by mid to late morning with VFR for
the afternoon under increasing high level moisture areawide ahead of
approaching trough. Onshore flow will spread a marine layer inland
Sunday morning with widespread low MVFR ceilings expected across the
lowlands of Western Washington.

KSEA...Confidence is somewhat low this morning in the areal coverage
of fog/stratus in the vicinity of the terminal. Will maintain tempo
LIFR conditions in current TAF and amend as conditions warrant. VFR
expected for the afternoon. A few hours of MVFR stratus are likely
Sunday morning between 12Z and 18Z.
Surface winds N/NE 5 to 8 knots shifting northwesterly this
afternoon...then backing to southwesterly this evening.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface ridging over the interior of British Columbia
will weaken today. Seas over the coastal waters will drop below 10
feet this morning. Onshore flow will increase late today into
tonight ahead of a weak system moving into southern B.C. This will
be sufficient to generate small craft advisory westerlies in the
central/east strait this evening and overnight. Northwesterlies will
also pick up over the coastal waters tonight, but current forecasts
are capped around 20 knots.

Surface ridging offshore will expand into the inland waters late
Sunday into Monday allowing onshore flow to relax and perhaps turn
weakly offshore. A weak front will approach the area late Tuesday
into Wednesday for possible wind and sea related headlines over the
coastal waters.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
