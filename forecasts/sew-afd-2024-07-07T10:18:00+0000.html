Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
318 AM PDT Sun Jul 7 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Hot and dry conditions will persist under a stout
upper-level ridge into next week. Some relief is expected towards
Wednesday-Thursday as the aforementioned ridge progress eastward
and flattens. However, above normal temperatures and no
precipitation will remain.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery depicts
mostly clear skies across the entire PNW at this hour. That is of
no surprise given a strong 500mb ridge amplifying over the region
leading to large-scale subsidence and well-above average
temperatures. Today, this ridge will remain largely in place and
into the rest of the short term forecast. Its axis will stretch
far into BC and the PNW Sunday-Monday before positioning over
Alberta and the Intermountain West by Tuesday. This period will
feature the hottest temperatures (15 to 20 degrees above normal)
as highs top out well into the 80s and 90s throughout W WA. Triple
digit values are not out of the question with the most likely
areas being Olympia south along I-5 and Cascade valleys and
foothills. The immediate coastline will be the coolest location
with highs staying put in the 60s and 70s. Overnight lows will
also remain in the lower 60s for areas inland, making for slow
relief from the daytime highs.

Widespread HeatRisk reaching moderate levels is expected for much
of W WA. Areas of major HeatRisk are favored in the Seattle metro
as well as the Olympic and Cascade valleys. This level of heat
affects anyone without effective cooling and/or adequate
hydration. As a result, a heat advisory is in effect through
Tuesday evening for most of the area through Tuesday evening.
Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room if
possible, stay out of the sun, and check up on relatives and
neighbors.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...We`ll begin to see some
reprieve as we go into the long term forecast. The stubborn ridge
will push further eastward and flatten. An intrusion of marine
cooled air will then pool into W WA Wednesday-Thursday as
temperatures drop but still above average. Nevertheless, the
threat for heat related impacts should lessen so we`ll take our
wins where we can get them. Highs are to be in the mid 70s to mid
80s with coastal areas staying in the 60s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mostly VFR with areas of IFR/LIFR ceilings along the
coast associated with a weak marine stratus push. Conditions along
the coast will improve after sunrise while the rest of the region
will see VFR conditions continue as high pressure dominates. N/NE
winds 5 kt or less overnight, increasing again this afternoon back
to 8 to 12 kt and becoming more N/NW.

KSEA...VFR conditions through the TAF period. North winds 4 to 8 kt,
increasing in the afternoon back to 8 to 12 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>.MARINE...High pressure still remains offshore, with a thermal
trough lingering over the west coast. North/northwesterly winds will
continue over the coastal waters through the weekend for generally
benign marine conditions.

A surface front will push across the area waters on Wednesday for
increased onshore flow and stronger pushes down the Strait of Juan
de Fuca. Winds will likely be elevated through this period and are
favored to remain that way through the end of next week.

Coastal seas 4 to 6 feet throughout the weekend, and will gradually
increase to 6 to 8 feet by the end of next week.

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Strong high pressure aloft is currently bringing very
warm and dry conditions to the region. With the additional factor
of instability, the red flag warning for the Cascades zones (658
and 659) will remain unchanged. Elsewhere, the primary concern for
the lower elevations and foothills south and east of Puget Sound
will be the continued critical afternoon relative humidity values.
For these zones, there`s at least one factor (fuel readiness,
instability or winds) that remains lacking, but given the
continued trends there remains the potential for needing a Red
Flag Warning for additional zones for Monday and Tuesday. Some
onshore flow will bring somewhat higher humidities for the coastal
and Olympics zones Monday, but it could be at late as Wednesday-
Thursday before portions of the Cascades see notable improvement.
