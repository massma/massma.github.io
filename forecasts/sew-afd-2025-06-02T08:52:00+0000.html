Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
152 AM PDT Mon Jun 2 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper ridge will remain over the Northeast
Pacific through the week, maintaining generally dry conditions
and temperatures near to slightly above normal. Warmer
temperatures expected for next weekend as the upper ridge moves
over Western Washington.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mostly clear conditions
across Western Washington early this morning, with high clouds
spreading southwards into the area. Stratus is also developing
around Grays Harbor County. High clouds will be around this
morning, with the low stratus confined mainly to the SW WA
coastline, otherwise, mostly sunny conditions by late morning
through the afternoon. Seasonable temperatures today with highs
in the 60s to low 70s.

An upper ridge located over the NE Pacific will remain in place
through the middle of the week, with continued NW flow aloft for
Western Washington. Dry conditions again expected for Tuesday
with temperatures warming a few more degrees for highs in the
afternoon. A weak disturbance will move along the NE periphery
of the ridge on Wednesday, resulting in increased onshore flow.
Stratus will be more widespread into Puget Sound Wednesday
morning, with perhaps some drizzle along the coast as well.
Temperatures on Wednesday will remain in the 60s to low 70s
again across the area.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The upper ridge
will maintain a position across the NE Pacific through late
week, resulting in continued dry conditions. Another weak
disturbance will move across Washington on Friday, increasing
onshore flow again, although little in the way of QPF is
expected. Ensembles are in better agreement that upper ridging
builds a bit further into Western Washington over the weekend.
There remains some uncertainty as to the extent of ridging, with
GEFS a bit flatter compared to GEPS/EPS. Either way,
temperatures look to warm a bit further Saturday and Sunday for
this reason, with highs potentially into the 80s for some areas
by Sunday. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge remains centered offshore with
northwest flow aloft over Western Washington. The low level flow
is light onshore. With the exception of a few pockets of MVFR
stratus near the coast this morning, VFR conditions are expected
across the region today with varying degrees of high level clouds.
There is a better chance of MVFR/IFR stratus developing along the
coast late tonight, but it is expected to make only a limited
intrusion inland on Tuesday morning.

KSEA...VFR under variable high clouds today. Surface winds light
northerly rising to 7 to 10 knots this afternoon. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Strong surface ridging centered well offshore will
continue to produce varying degrees of onshore flow through the week
ahead. Weak systems passing well north of the area will occasionally
increase the onshore flow enough for small craft advisory
strength westerlies in the central and east portions of the strait
by midweek.

Small craft advisories remain posted for the coastal waters through
tonight and Tuesday for a combination of gusty northwest winds and
steep seas.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
