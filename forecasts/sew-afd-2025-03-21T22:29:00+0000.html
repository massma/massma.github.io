Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
329 PM PDT Fri Mar 21 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow continues through tonight for continued
showers and periods of mountain snow. An atmospheric river will
bring steadier precipitation late Saturday into Monday, along with
increasing snow levels. A warm, drier day expected on Tuesday.
Upper trough will approach the Pacific Northwest Wednesday into
Thursday for additional unsettled weather.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showers continue this
afternoon with onshore flow, with more stratiform precipitation
across southern Washington into northern Oregon. Scattered showers
will continue through tonight, with potential convergence zone
activity developing in the vicinity of Snohomish County. Snow
levels will also drop towards 1500 to 2500 feet by this evening,
resulting in periods of steadier snow for the Cascades. The
convergence zone is expected to setup in the vicinity of Stevens
Pass, allowing for brief periods of heavy snow rates approaching,
or briefly exceeding, 1" per hour in the central Cascades. The
winter weather headlines continue for the mountains through early
Saturday morning before precipitation begins to taper off.

A warm front will move across Western Washington on Sunday, with
increasing stratiform precipitation, and rising snow levels. Snow
levels will initially be around 2000 to 3500 feet at the onset of
precipitation Saturday night, for additional light to moderate
snowfall for the Cascades and Olympics. Snow levels will then rise
rapidly to 6000 to 7000 feet later Sunday into Monday. This will
result in rising river levels, refer to the .HYDROLOGY discussion
for more information. In addition, south winds will increase in
the warm sector on Sunday, with gusts ranging 20 to 40 MPH across
Western Washington.

Precipitation will be around on Monday, albeit lighter in
magnitude as an upper ridge across the western US builds further
into the Pacific Northwest. Temperatures Saturday and Sunday will
remain in the low to mid 50s, before warming into the low 60s for
some areas by Monday.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The upper ridge axis will
build further into Western Washington on Tuesday. This will result
in primarily dry conditions, and the warmest temperatures so far
this season. Forecast high temperatures range in the mid 60s to
low 70s King County southwards, with slightly cooler temperatures
to the north. NBM deterministic forecast highs on Tuesday would
suggest record breaking temperatures possible at OLM, SEA, and the
NWS Seattle office. Record high minimum temperatures are also
possible both Tuesday and Wednesday morning.

The forecast gets a bit more uncertain by midweek as a deep upper
trough well offshore approaches the west coast. Ensembles remain
uncertain in both the timing and position of this trough. We will
have to monitor the potential for a negatively tilted upper trough
offshore, with more S/SSE flow aloft. This would be a more
anomalous pattern during the spring time, and may result in more
of the way convective potential. ECMWF EFI (Extreme Forecast Index
for EPS members) highlights CAPE values during Wednesday
timeframe being anomalous to climatology as well. However, details
remain uncertain, and this will need to be refined more over the
next few days. Cooler, unsettled weather is then expected on
Thursday as the upper trough moves onshore, for a return of
lowland rain and mountain snow. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West-southwest flow aloft becoming more northwesterly as
ridging builds into Saturday. Currently, VFR is observed area-wide
as a frontal boundary pushes east of the Cascades. Breezy winds
remain in its wake as gusts up to 20-25 kt. For tonight, a mix of
MVFR and low-end VFR is in the offing. A PSCZ may keep lower cigs in
the vicinity of KPAE during this time. Surface winds will decrease
to 4 to 8 kt. Mostly VFR into the day on Saturday with
aforementioned transient ridging aloft.

KSEA...VFR at the terminal this afternoon. Mostly low-end VFR cigs
into the evening (can`t rule out brief MVFR cigs under heavier
showers). Though, HREF probabilities of cigs below 3,000 ft are
around 50-60% around 12-16z Saturday so a window of MVFR is possible
during this time. VFR cigs into much of Saturday. SW gusts up to 20
kt this afternoon but winds should decrease into tonight and
Saturday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low-level onshore as we`re post-frontal across area
waters. SCAs remain in effect for the coastal waters, West Entrance,
and Grays Harbor Bar for high seas but the Bar`s advisory may be
allowed to expire this evening. A SCA for winds continues for winds
as a westerly push through the Central and Eastern Strait is favored
for this evening before diminishing early Saturday. Seas are to
remain between 10-12 ft through the weekend. The next disturbance
will arrive Sunday-Sunday night with a chance for more widespread
SCA winds. Surface high pressure Monday-Tuesday before active
weather returns Wednesday onward.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showers will be around Western Washington through
early Saturday, however, rises on rivers will be limited to due
lower QPF and snow levels. Precipitation will increase Saturday
night through Monday of next week associated with an atmospheric
river. In addition, snow levels will rise to 6000 to 7000 feet for
most areas Sunday and Monday. This will result in rises on rivers
across Western Washington. At this time, the Skokomish River is
forecast to exceed minor flood stage Sunday night. However, we
continue to monitor other area rivers as well during this period.
A brief period of drier weather is expected Tuesday, before the
return of unsettled weather midweek. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
