Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
239 AM PDT Thu Apr 10 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Clouds will continue to increase this morning ahead of
a cold front pushing through western Washington this afternoon.
Expect rain showers to increase second half of thursday,
accompanied by breezy winds along coastal areas. A couple rumbles
of thunder are possible closer to the Canadian border. Drier
weather is expected late this weekend into early next week. High
temperatures will reach low to mid 60s today and next week, with
cooler temperatures in between.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level analysis shows
an upper level ridge still over much of WA this morning, with the
axis over Spokane and the eastside. A trough and surface low
pressure system sits approximately 100 miles offshore, with a
warm front extending to just off the coastline. Satellite and
radar remain relatively quiet, with pockets of clouds over much of
western WA, and areas of drizzle/light showers ahead of the warm
front tracking north.

Cloud coverage is expected to increase this morning as a pair of
fronts approach the coast this afternoon. The warm sector will
increase warm southerly flow aloft that will work its way to the
surface. High temperatures for Thursday will be some 5 to 10
degrees above normal for most Puget Sound/lowland sites. A couple
isolated 70 degree highs are possible in a couple valley areas
towards the Cascades, otherwise most areas will see highs in the
mid 60s today.

The rain showers will arrive with the cold front later this
afternoon and evening. These showers will be widespread in
coverage as a linear line moving through by the evening commute.
The showers will taper back, becoming isolated pockets by late
Thursday evening. Post front, a convergence zone is expected to
develop north of I-90 Thursday evening into Friday morning. The
HREF has picked up on a little bit of CAPE over the Cascades
today, especially towards the north with values up to 100 J/kg.
With that said, a couple rumbles of thunder are possible towards
Whatcom/Skagit Counties later this evening. Most areas will
receive between 0.10-0.20 inches of QPF. Higher amounts are likely
in the Cascade and Olympic peaks of 0.50 inches, but snow will be
a factor in these areas with drops to 3,000 ft early Friday
morning. Snow accumulations will be limited to the highest
elevations.

Breezy south to southwest winds will also accompany the frontal
passage today. The windiest spots will be coastal areas (along the
Pacific Coast and the interior waters, particularly from Port
Ludlow up through Whidbey Island to Bellingham). The HREF puts
mean peak wind gusts in these areas at 40 mph for a few hours
Thursday afternoon, with a 20 to 30% chance that gusts exceed
wind advisory criteria (45 mph) in the windiest coastal areas.

A lingering trough will keep shower chances in the forecast
remainder of Friday into Saturday. Precipitation amounts are
expected to be in the few hundredths of an inch. High temperatures
will come down behind the cold front to highs in the mid 50s. The
lows Saturday night into Sunday may dip down into the low to mid
30s, particularly in the Chehalis Valley. With skies clearing that
night with a departing low and incoming high, this will increase
the potential for frost for areas able to get cool enough.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Ensembles are just about
identical with the cool and fair weather moving in Sunday (again,
temperatures just above freezing are possible Sunday morning). The
skies will clear out significantly too with high pressure building
in via a ridge. Once the ridge moves inland, temperatures will
warm back up into the mid 60s for highs Monday and Tuesday with
quiet weather. There is some disagreement for next Wednesday how
far a low might drop down from Alaska, but this will be the first
chance of any precipitation into next week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow will persist aloft through the TAF
period as an upper level trough moves into the region. A frontal
system moving across the area today will bring the next round of
rain and gusty winds. Rain is likely to move in along the coast
between 18-20Z, making it into the interior terminals this
afternoon between 21-23Z. Conditions early this morning remain
VFR, though expect conditions to lower towards MVFR as the rain
approaches. Southerly surface winds will increase this morning,
first along the coast (between 15-18Z) then across the interior
(between 18-21Z). Gusts to 30 kt will be possible into this
evening. Winds will shift to the W/SW behind the front and
gradually ease throughout the evening hours. Ceilings look to
lower towards more widespread MVFR again by Friday morning.

KSEA...VFR conditions to persist through this morning. Southerly
winds will increase between 18-21Z to 10-20 kt. Gusts to 30 kt
will be possible this afternoon and evening, before winds ease
later tonight. Rain is likely to make it into the terminal between
21-23Z and could briefly lower cigs and vis to MVFR conditions.
Probabilistic guidance hinting at a 25-35 percent chance of MVFR
cigs developing at the terminal again by early Friday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system will move across the area today, bringing
gusty southerly winds to the majority of the area waters. A Gale
Warning remains in effect for the coastal waters with frequent
gusts to 40 kt likely. Winds across the interior waters will
increase to 20-30 kt through the morning hours ahead of the front
and will remain breezy into the evening before easing. Thus,
small craft advisories have been issued for the interior waters
from the Puget Sound waters up to the Canadian border. A push of
westerly winds down the Strait of Juan de Fuca will likely yield
small craft westerlies in the wake of the front into Friday
morning. Winds will then ease on Friday as high pressure starts to
build back over the northeastern Pacific.

High pressure will persist over the coastal waters through the
weekend. Guidance then hints at a trough extending northward along
the Washington coast by early Monday. Should this come to fruition,
this would allow for winds to briefly turn offshore on Monday.
Offshore winds will be short-lived, however, as high pressure over
the northeastern Pacific builds back over the coastal waters by
Monday evening. A frontal system may clip the waters early next
week as it moves inland to the north, but does not look to bring
much impact to the area at this time.

Seas over the coastal waters persisting at 4-6 ft morning will
build towards 9-11 ft today and remain at this range into Friday.
Seas will subside towards 4-6 ft again over the weekend and hover
between this range into early next week.
