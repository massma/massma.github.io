Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
359 PM EDT Mon May 20 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will be in control through Wednesday. Offshore high
pressure going into midweek gives way to an approaching cold front
Thursday. This cold front moves across Thursday night and eventually
slows down south of Long Island Friday before dissipating. High
pressure returns to the local area thereafter for Friday night
into early Saturday. Another low pressure system approaches the
area next weekend. A stronger frontal system approaches for early
next week<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM TUESDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Deep-layered ridging will be over the region tonight. Mainly clear
this evening, then perhaps some cirrus overnight. Models also
showing some coastal stratus and/or fog late tonight. Given very
light winds from the surface up through the bottom of a low level
inversion aloft and low dewpoint depressions, thinking there will
patchy/areas of fog for coastal areas. As always, not very high
confidence in the areal coverage and density of the fog, but
something to keep an eye on tonight.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The ridge aloft flattens Tuesday through Wednesday, but surface high
pressure will remain in control. After any early stratus/fog, it
should be a mostly sunny day for Tuesday, and mostly sunny for
Wednesday as well. Showers well ahead of a pre-frontal trough
approach late Wednesday, but will go with a dry forecast through the
afternoon.

Regarding high temperatures, deterministic NBM continues to run
closer to the 10th and 25th percentiles. Blended the deterministic
with the 50th percentile for both days based on forecast
temperatures at the top of the mixed layer. Might need to lean even
closer to the 50th percentile for Wednesday with a better chance of
mixing through 850mb away from the coast given wind direction and
weaker subsidence from aloft as ridging flattens. Highs will be
above normal both days with Wednesday being the warmer day. No
records anticipated, but highs on Wednesday around 90 for NE NJ and
parts of the Lower Hudson Valley and city. Dewpoints will be low
enough to keep heat indices right around the ambient
temperature.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The key points pertain to Thursday and Thursday night.

First, another day with well above normal temperatures is
anticipated for Thursday with high temperatures ranging from the
upper 60s to mid 70s along the coast and across much of Long Island
to upper 70s to upper 80s across parts of the north shore of Long
Island, NYC, NE NJ, Lower Hudson Valley and interior Southern CT.
Some interior spots could have heat indices reach around 90.

Second, there is a low change, marginal, threat for severe
thunderstorms Thursday into Thursday evening with potential for
downbursts and perhaps some hail.

High pressure will eventually give way to an approaching cold front
Wednesday night into Thursday. The parent low attached to this front
will be weakening as it moves farther north of the Great Lakes. This
will lead thereby to a weakening of the cold front.

High temperatures forecast on Thursday are more in the low 70s to
mid 80s range, with a lot of locations forecast to be slightly
cooler due to increased clouds. However, some locations on Long
Island are actually having high temperatures forecast slightly
warmer than the previous day due to a more westerly component to the
winds.

There will be a chance for showers and thunderstorms out ahead and
along the cold front for Thursday into Thursday night. The cold
front is forecast to move across Thursday night. Chances for showers
and thunderstorms decrease late Thursday night after the cold
frontal passage.

There is potential for some thunderstorms to be strong to severe
with the cold front with surface CAPE forecast to be up to near 2000
J/kg and forecast 0-6 km AGL bulk shear of 30 to 35 kt. With these
factors, severe threat level is more on the marginal side with the
coverage expected to be mostly isolated to scattered of the showers
and thunderstorms themselves. This combination is forecast to be
across some locations north and west of NYC. No hydrologic concerns
at this time as showers and thunderstorms will be fast moving,
really limiting total rainfall accumulations.

Mainly dry conditions are forecast Friday through Friday night with
the eventual return of weak high pressure. High temperatures Friday
are forecast still to be above normal but cooler, with a range
mainly from the lower 70s to lower 80s for much of the area.

Rain showers return to the forecast for the weekend but
probabilities are low initially with more of a chance Saturday night
through Sunday night. This will be as another low pressure system
makes its approach and gets close enough to the local region to give
higher chances of rain. Another frontal system approaches for early
next week, keeping the chances for showers in the forecast.

Temperatures more of a decline with more easterly component to the
wind weekend into early next week. Highs get more in the 70s for
much of the area with more 60s along the coast.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /20Z MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak surface high pressure remains over the area through tonight.

VFR conditions through the TAF period. There is the potential
for MVFR cigs to move back in tonight, but confidence on how far
west it will overspread is low at this time. Will continue with
low end VFR (BKN035) and SCT020 to show the MVFR potential
tonight. KGON is the only terminal with enough confidence to
prevail MVFR conditions tonight. Low clouds should burn off
Tuesday morning.

S winds around 10 kts, will shift SE-S this evening and into
tonight. Winds become light and variable for outlying terminals. Sea
breeze develops once again Tuesday afternoon.

   NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Uncertainty with how far west MVFR cigs will go tonight.


OUTLOOK FOR 20Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

Tuesday-Wednesday: VFR. Chc S-SW gusts around 20kt both
afternoons.

Thursday: VFR in the morning, then a chance of afternoon and evening
MVFR with showers and thunderstorms. Chc SW gusts around 20kt.

Friday: VFR. Chc NW gusts around 20kt.

Saturday: VFR.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>One thing that might need to be monitored for tonight is the
possibility of dense fog late tonight into Tuesday morning with
light winds and elevated low level RH. Otherwise, sub-advisory
conditions are expected across all waters through the end of next
week. However, Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons are likely to see a
coastal jet produce gusts up to 20-25 kt, especially on Wednesday,
and seas of 3 to 4 ft in the NY Bight along with seas possibly
touching 5 ft.

For the marine long term forecast from Wednesday night through
Saturday night, conditions are forecast to remain mainly below SCA
thresholds on all forecast marine zones. Only exception would be
Wednesday night with some SCA level wind gusts on the ocean.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
