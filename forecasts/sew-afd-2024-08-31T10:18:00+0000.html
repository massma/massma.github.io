Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
318 AM PDT Sat Aug 31 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper-ridging will remain in place through the
weekend. Here, we`ll see more summer-like conditions. A transient
trough will reintroduce showers into the forecast early next week
along with a cool down. However, additional ridging is slated midweek
onward as temps trend warmer.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Good morning, western
Washington. Current temperatures from a few spots here at 3 AM:
Gig Harbor 63 F - Burlington 55 F - Whidbey Island Naval Air
Station 55 F.

An upper-ridge continues across the PNW and the rest of western
US. Not a cloud in the sky given current satellite and large-
scale subsidence holds. High temperatures will generally remain
5-10 F above average today for late August. Light offshore flow
with aforementioned ridging will help top values into the 70s
along the coast and areas adjacent to the inland waters. The
interior is expected to range throughout the 80s and lower 90s
with the hottest spots within Cascade valleys and Chehalis River
valley. HeatRisk levels will reach the moderate/orange category
across much of the region with isolated major/red within mentioned
valleys. Overnight lows are to range between the mid 50s to lower
60s.

Temperatures are still on track to cool down on Sunday as the flow
switches onshore. Coastal areas should see the return of more
seasonal conditions however, temps across the interior will remain
elevated as 80s and a lesser chance for 90s continue. Models
continue to hint at an upper-trough looming offshore that`ll
bring not only a widespread shot of cooler weather but PoPs look
to become reintroduced into the forecast on Monday. A slight
chance for thunderstorms must be expressed with the best chance
right now over the Cascades. Temperatures are forecast to drop
upwards of 10-15 F across the interior as the upper-low positions
over the PNW.


.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The low will be over the
Inland Northwest by Tuesday as ridging returns here locally. This
will result in warm and dry conditions returning during the
middle portion of next week. However, the duration of warm and dry
conditions is uncertain. Cluster analysis shows significant
differences in the potential patterns by late next week, ranging
continued ridging and warm and dry weather to incoming troughing
that`ll result in cooler weather.

.AVIATION...Western Washington remaining on the back side of an
upper level ridge through Sunday. Southerly flow aloft becoming
southwesterly Sunday. In the lower levels offshore flow this
morning will weaken this afternoon. Low level flow turning onshore
Sunday.

Just a few high clouds moving through today and tonight. Stratus
with ceilings below 500 feet right along the coastline getting as
far north as Grays Harbor this morning before retreating. Low
stratus making up most of the coastline early Sunday morning.

KSEA...Just a few high clouds. Northerly winds 6 to 10 knots with
the strongest winds late afternoon/early evening hours. Felton

.MARINE...Thermally induced low pressure along the coast
during the morning hours will shift inland during the afternoon
and evening hours today then shift east of the Cascades Sunday.
Increasing onshore flow Sunday with high pressure over the coastal
waters. The onshore flow pattern will continue into Tuesday.
Another thermally induced trough will try and move up the coast
Wednesday.

Small craft advisory westerly winds likely in the Central and
Eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca Sunday evening and Monday evening.

.FIRE WEATHER...High pressure will promote warm and dry conditions
through the weekend. This, combined with light offshore flow in
the low levels will allow for relative humidity values to drop
into the 15-20 percent in the southern portions of the Cascades
and mountain valleys. Relative humidity recovery overnight won`t
be stellar. Conditions will also become unstable over the region
during the afternoon this weekend, which would meet critical fire
weather criteria.

Area fuels, however, currently remain moist from recent rains,
mitigating the impact of the critical fire weather conditions.
Fuels will continue to dry out quickly, however, and it`s possible
that ERCs will exceed the 90 percentile and bring the possibility
of Red Flag conditions over the weekend. So it will be important
to monitor how fast fuels respond. 14
