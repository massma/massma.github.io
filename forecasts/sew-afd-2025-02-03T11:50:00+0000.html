Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
350 AM PST Mon Feb 3 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level trough will remain parked over Western
Washington into Friday. The trough will move east over the weekend
but a colder than normal air mass will remain in place over the
area. Much below normal temperatures with snow showers at times
decreasing in the middle of the week. Temperatures a little warmer
for the weekend. Fraser River outflow winds will continue through
at least Wednesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
cold upper level trough over Western Washington with a large cold
cumulus field along the coast extending well back to the west and
north. Cloud top temperatures associated with the cumulus a
little warmer this morning versus the last couple of days. Doppler
radar showing snow showers west of Puget Sound and over Whatcom
and Skagit county. Isolated snow showers elsewhere. Temperatures
at 3 am/11z were in the mid 20s to mid 30s.

Another round of snow showers in store for the area today as the
upper level trough remains in place with light low level offshore
flow in the lower levels. West southwesterly flow aloft directing
showers across the area the whole day. Snow levels will be near
the surface. Like yesterday morning there is a weak snow shadow
between Seattle and Everett early this morning but this will fill
in by 7 am. With the warmer cloud temperature tops offshore and
less daytime heating today will not mention any thunderstorm
activity in the forecast although a strike is still possible this
afternoon. New snow totals mostly an inch or less with higher
accumulations, 1 to 2 or 3 inches, along the coast and over the
Northwest Interior. Models continue to be a little agressive with
the Fraser River outflow winds. Current Bellingham to Williams
Lake gradient -13 mb with models solutions showing -17 to -20 mb.
Will keep outflow winds in Whatcom county well below advisory
criteria. Highs today in the mid 30s.

Same story initially tonight with the shower activity decreasing
in the evening hours over the interior with shower activity
continuing along the coast. High resolution models picking up a
weak feature over the Puget Sound area in the early morning hours.
This will be the best chance in this entire scenario for more
widespread coverage of snow for the metro area. Amounts still look
light, an inch or less. If this feature gets a little stronger
next shift could put up a Winter Weather Advisory for the metro
area. For the remainder of the interior just a chance of snow
showers in the early morning hours with snow showers continuing
along the coast. Fraser River outflow winds will create the possibility
of some upslope snow in the northeast slopes of the Olympics.
Lows tonight in the 20s.

Upper level trough digging south and west Tuesday with the flow
aloft over the area becoming southwest. Low level flow
remaining offshore. As the trough digs southwest it will pull
some but not all of the snow shower activity away from the
interior. Once again snow accumulations will be hit or miss and
for the most part one inch or less. Highs in the mid 30s. Could
see a slight increase in the Fraser River outflow winds over
Whatcom county but winds still below advisory criteria. The
outflow winds will continue the possibility of upslope snow in the
northeastern slopes of the Olympics.

Little change in the pattern Tuesday night into Wednesday with the
upper level trough elongating but remaining over the area. Showers
will continue to be in the form of snow through the period with
hit or miss accumulations. Lows in the 20s with highs in the mid
30s.

No changes to the Winter Weather Advisory and the Cold Weather
Advisory this morning.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement Thursday and Friday with the upper level trough
weakening overhead as the jet stream moves into California.
Operational models beginning to dry things out a bit but the
ensembles still have enough wet solutions to keep chance pops in
the forecast with a chance of snow showers in the overnight and
morning hours. Highs in the mid to upper 30s and lows in the 20s.

Trough kicks east Friday night with northwesterly flow aloft over
the weekend. Model solutions inconsistent with the GFS indicating
a couple of weak systems embedded in the northwesterly flow aloft
moving through the area while the ECMWF is fairly dry. Ensemble
solutions similar to the operational runs. With the lack of
consistency will have another couple days with chance pops. Even
with the trough moving out of the area the air mass does not
moderate very much leaving temperatures below normal over the
weekend with highs in the upper 30s to mid 40s and lows in the mid
20s to lower 30s. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough axis will remain just offshore
into tonight for west to southwesterly flow aloft over Western
Washington. The low level flow will transition to offshore or
northerly across much of the area later today into tonight as colder
air associated with Fraser River outflow spills southward. A general
increase in scattered snow shower coverage is expected later today
into tonight as another upper disturbance associated with the trough
rotates onshore. Ceilings will be a mixed bag with ceilings lowering
to MVFR or localized IFR in and near snow showers with surface
visibilities occasionally lowering to 1-3SM.

KSEA...Ceilings will be a mix of VFR and MVFR this morning.
Expecting a general increase in snow showers later today and tonight
with ceilings deteriorating to primarily MVFR tonight under
scattered snow showers and occasional surface visibility of 3-5SM.
Surface winds southerly 7 knots or less this morning will gradually
veer to north/northeasterly 4 to 7 knots from 00Z onward.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak surface trough will remain over the coastal
waters into midweek with surface ridging in place over the interior
of British Columbia for offshore flow. This will produce small craft
advisory E/NE winds across the Northern Inland waters well as the
west entrance to the strait and adjacent coastal waters. A general
offshore flow pattern looks to remain in place much of the week, but
Fraser River outflow winds across the Northern Inland waters will
ease as the surface ridge over interior British Columbia gradually
weakens. Coastal seas look to remain under 10 feet through the
period.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
