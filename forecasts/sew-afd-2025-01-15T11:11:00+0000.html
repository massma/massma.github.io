Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
311 AM PST Wed Jan 15 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge over the area today weakening
tonight. Weak front moving through Thursday. Upper level ridge
rebuilding offshore beginning Thursday night. The ridge will
remain in place through the first part of next week with dry
northerly flow aloft over Western Washington. Coolest air mass of
the season over the weekend into next week with morning lows in
the 20s most places Sunday through Tuesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows low
clouds continuing over the the interior from about Skagit county
southward, along the Strait of Juan de Fuca and over the Lower
Chehalis Valley and Central Coast. Clear skies over the remainder
of the area. Patchy fog reducing visibility to less than a mile.
Temperatures at 3 am/11z were in the lower 30s to lower 40s.

Upper level ridge remaining over Western Washington today with
light flow in the lower levels. Early morning top reports around
1500 feet msl making the layer about 1000 feet thick. This is
similar to Tuesday morning. Also like Tuesday morning, light flow
in the lower levels. Stratus coverage slightly less this morning
with Whatcom county in the clear. Stratus slowly eroding this
afternoon from the edges. Cross cascade gradient becoming more
negative this afternoon. This little bit of downsloping/drier air
in the lower levels will help dissipate the stratus. Will go for a
mid to late afternoon breakout with the Central Puget Sound the
last to go. Highs in the mid 40s.

Upper level ridge weakening overnight. Stratus reforming this
evening, at a higher base, combined with increasing high clouds
ahead of approaching front making for mostly cloudy skies. Chance
of rain North Coast/Western Strait of Juan de Fuca by 12z
Thursday. Lows in the 30s.

What is left of the front dragging through Western Washington
Thursday. Front reaching Puget Sound area midday and will be in
the Cascades early to mid afternoon with little in the way of post
frontal showers for the lowlands. Chance pops with the front
except for the North Cascades where pops will be in the likely
category. Precipitation amounts, if any, will be less than a
tenth of an inch. Highs in the mid 40s.

Post front weak onshore push Thursday night moistening up the
lower layers enough for a shallow layer of stratus to form again.
Shower activity in the Cascades will come to an end by 06z Friday.
Lows in the lower to mid 30s.

Upper level ridge building offshore Friday with cool north
northwesterly flow aloft. Mostly sunny day after the stratus
dissipates. With the flow in the lower levels becoming light
Thursday night could see some morning freezing fog in the south
Puget Sound and Southwest Interior. Highs only in the lower to mid
40s.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement with high amplitude upper level ridge offshore through
the period. Dry and cool northerly flow aloft over the area. Light
offshore gradients in the lower levels. The cooler air mass aloft
will result in the coldest low temperatures of the season with
most locations in the 20s Sunday through Tuesday morning. The
colder/drier air mass will keep fog and low clouds from forming in
the late night and morning hours in most locations. Even with
plenty of sunshine highs only in the upper 30s to mid 40s. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper ridging over the region will weaken and
shift eastward today with northwest flow aloft backing to west to
southwesterly as a weak front approaches the area. Widespread
LIFR/IFR ceilings in fog and low clouds with areas of surface
visibilities below 3SM will remain in place into midday. Any
afternoon lifting and/or scattering will be brief at best.
Increasing onshore flow associated with a frontal system late
tonight into Thursday morning is expected to produce widespread IFR
or low MVFR ceilings along with a few showers mainly coast and
north.

KSEA...LIFR stratus expected to persist through the morning.
Guidance is once again going with a brief late afternoon/early
evening break out of the low clouds. Confidence in this occurring is
low. However, any improvement will be short-lived as increasing
onshore flow will bring a solid IFR or very low MVFR ceiling back by
04Z-06Z tonight. Surface winds light northerly reversing to
southerly 4 to 7 knots near or after 00Z. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface ridging over the waters will weaken today and a
weak front will cross the area early Thursday morning. Broad ridging
rebuilds offshore in its wake for increasing onshore flow. Current
headlines for the outer coastal waters will likely need to be
expanded to include the inner coastal waters and portions of the
strait on Thursday. The offshore ridge will expand into the interior
by the weekend for a return to offshore flow. This pattern will then
persist well into early next week.

Seas in the 8 to 11 ft range will continue over portions of the
coastal waters into Friday before subsiding this weekend.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No river flooding in the next 7 days.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.CLIMATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The record January dry spell in Seattle is 15 days,
January 16-30, 1963. We had a 9 day dry spell in January 2022 (
21st thru 29th ). The January rainfall total in Seattle is 1.01
inches. Here are the top 5 driest Januarys in Seattle since record
started in 1945 at Seattle- Tacoma airport, 1. 0.58 inches 1985,
2. 0.77 inches 1949, 3. 1.77 inches 1977, 4 and 5. 2.25 inches
1979 and 1963. Since the record setting dry January 40 years ago
the driest January has been 2.51 inches in 1994 so one could say
we are on pace for the driest January in 40 years with just an
inch in the first half of the month. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
