Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
349 AM PST Thu Jan 2 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A series of weather systems will move through Western
Washington through Saturday. The first one will arrive this
afternoon followed by the second one later Friday and a third one
Saturday evening. Upper level ridge building offshore Sunday
moving inland Monday. The ridge will remain over the area into
Wednesday with weather systems trying to move through the ridge
Tuesday and Wednesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
unorganized front offshore just west of 130W early this morning.
Cloudy skies over Western Washington. Doppler radar picking up a
few light showers ahead of the front mainly along the coast.
Breaks in the cloud cover Wednesday evening allowed temperatures
to drop into the mid 30s to lower 40s. Increasing clouds the last
couple of hours have kept temperatures from falling further.

What is left of the front will move inland this afternoon. Rain
developing along the coast this morning spreading inland late
morning/early afternoon. Precipitation amounts not very impressive
with even the coast looking to get a quarter inch or less. Snow
levels ranging from 2000 to 3000 feet in the North Cascades, 3000
feet in the Central Cascades and 4000 feet in the South Cascades,
With the lighter precipitation only 1 to 3 inches of new snow in
the forecast. Highs today in the mid to upper 40s.

Front reaching the Cascades this evening. Upper level trough
offshore digging south pulling what little cold air there is
behind the front south of the area limiting the post frontal
showers. Next front approaching the area from the southwest will
spread cloud cover over the area overnight keeping skies at least
mostly cloudy. Best chance for some brief clearing will be near
the Canadian border putting the coldest low temperatures in
Whatcom county, in the mid 30s. For the remainder of the area lows
near 40.

Next system moving into Western Washington from the southwest with
rain spreading across the area from south to north Friday morning.
Cross cascade gradient bottoming out near -10 mb in the morning
giving some breezy easterly winds to the Cascade foothills. Also
breezy along the coast with east southeast winds ahead of the
front. Warmer air out ahead of the system will push snow levels up
a touch, near 5500 feet in the South Cascades to near 3500 feet
in the North Cascades. The easterly winds through the passes will
keep a narrow layer of cold air near the surface, especially in
Snoqualmie Pass, bringing up the possibility of freezing rain in
the passes Friday. This system has more juice with the
southwesterly flow aloft but the core of the upper level moisture
going inland south of the area. Still, half to an inch of rain
forecast for Friday as the warm front moves through Western
Washington.

Trailing cold front moving through late Friday night keeping rain
in the forecast. Cold front not near as juicy as the warm front
with a tenth to a quarter inch of rain expected. Easterly
gradients across the Cascades easing quickly bringing about an end
to the freezing rain threat in the passes.

The wet weather continues Saturday with rain out ahead of the next
system moving into the area in the morning. Rain continuing
through the afternoon. Snow levels hovering around 3500 feet for
snow at Stevens Pass and rain or possibly freezing rain at
Snoqualmie Pass. Not a very strong surface low with this front.
The 1009 mb low associated with the front moving toward the
northern tip of Vancouver Island keeping breezy conditions
confined to the coast.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Models in good agreement
with the front moving through Saturday night. Some trofiness over
the area Sunday keeping showers in the forecast. The operational
runs of both the ECMWF and GFS building an upper level ridge
offshore Sunday night with the ridge moving over the area Monday.
Ridge remaining over Western Washington through Wednesday. The
ensembles still are not sold with the strength of the ridge with
about 20 percent of the solutions indicating some light
precipitation Tuesday and Wednesday. Will give a nod to
climatology and keep the slight chance pops in the forecast
Tuesday and Wednesday. The 8-14 day outlook is hinting at a
possible break in the action as well with some above normal
temperatures. Stay tuned. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow aloft will shift to westerly by mid-
morning, then turn west-southwesterly as a weak upper level ridge
passes over W WA today. Surface winds in some spots have become
light and variable while those showing a direction are favoring east
to southeasterly with speeds mostly 5 kts or less. The exception is
HQM, seeing speeds ranging 5-10 kts. Forecast trends showing these
east to southeast winds will continue and become more widespread
with speeds 4-8 kts.

Mostly VFR conditions over W WA this early morning, although obs
along the Strait showing MVFR and some IFR obs coming from the south
Sound from usual suspects, OLM and PWT. Cigs will lower between the
time of this writing and 12Z with widespread MVFR conditions
expected to emerge between 12-15Z and remain there until the
afternoon or early evening, when cigs rebound back into VFR. A line
of light showers currently on radar passing through the area will
likely facilitate this descent while the passing of the ridge axis
throughout the day allowing cigs to recover.

KSEA...VFR conditions as of 09Z, however band of light showers
passed over the terminal just shy of 10Z and, as stated above, this
increase in low-level moisture will assist in bringing cigs down,
reaching MVFR by 12Z. Cigs will be slow to recover with MVFR
conditions lingering at least into the early afternoon before
starting to lift back into VFR by 00Z. VFR expected to remain in
place for the rest of the TAF period. Winds this morning bouncing
between easterly and southeasterly, becoming more solidly easterly
by 00Z. Speeds generally remaining 4-8 kts.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An occluded surface low remains over the NE PAC with
higher pressure over the interior. This gradient will maintain SCA
wind speeds over the coastal waters (mostly outer) and neighboring
West Strait this morning. As winds ease by noon, seas begin to build
to above 10 ft, essentially keeping an SCA up over the outer coastal
waters, just changing the reason. For the inner coastal waters,
these heightened seas will likely hold off until mid-afternoon
before reaching these zones, and as such held off on their inclusion
in the SCA until around 4 PM today. Seas will continue to build into
Friday, peaking Friday afternoon and evening 12-14 ft for the outer
coastal waters and 9 to 11 ft for the inner. Seas gradually ease
Friday night into Saturday morning before rising again over the
weekend.

Although winds will ease throughout much of the day today, will see
them start to gain speed again this evening and tonight. SCA level
winds expected to re-emerge over the coastal waters and West
Entrance by Friday morning...perhaps making it as far eastward as
the Central Strait. This combo of winds and seas warranted the
extension of the inherited SCA through 4 PM Friday for the coastal
waters, but hesitated on any areal expansion eastward for now.
Should models remain consistent with these speeds, expansion of the
advisory area would be likely. Current data suggests these winds
will ease Friday evening into Saturday morning before ramping up
again Saturday evening.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weather systems will move across Western Washington
through the weekend resulting in additional precipitation. Each of
these systems will be fairly progressive, which will limit the
total rainfall accumulation with each system. Heaviest rainfall
amounts are expected over the southern Olympics, with 2 to 4
inches Friday through Sunday. This could be enough to push the
Skokomish River over flood stage this weekend. Rises on the
remaining rivers as well but no river flooding is forecast. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.CLIMATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Seattle did not have a day with at least an inch of
rain in 2024. This is the first year in 80 years of records at
Seattle-Tacoma airport that there has not been at least one day
in the year with a 1 inch plus rainfall. The last time Seattle got
a 1 inch plus rain day was December 5th, 2023 with 2.39 inches.
There has not been a streak like this in over 30 years. The
current 393 day streak without an inch of rain or more is the 3rd
longest streak at Seattle-Tacoma airport. The longer two streaks
586 days 1/5/1976 to 8/22/1977 and 582 days 3/23/1993 to
10/25/1994. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
