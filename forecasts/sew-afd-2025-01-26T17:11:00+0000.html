Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
911 AM PST Sun Jan 26 2025

.SYNOPSIS...An upper level ridge centered offshore will gradually
build into the region through the early portion of the week. This
will lead to dry conditions and chilly overnight temperatures.
The ridge will weaken by midweek and a series of systems will
bring a return of lowland rain and mountain snow Friday into the
weekend, with a threat of lowland snow late in the weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No forecast updates planned this
morning. Previous discussion follows with updates to marine/aviation
portions. 27

Strong high pressure over the Pac NW keeps western WA dry and stable
through early this week. There`s little to no variation in the
forecast - lows in the 20s and 30s, highs in the 40s, clear skies
(plenty of sun). 33

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...The ridge is overhead
Wednesday and Thursday and the air mass will be a little warmer
with highs in the mid/upper 40s to around 50. Overnight lows will
still be chilly and below freezing in most spots. The ridge will
exit east Thursday night into Friday and a frontal system will
bring rain and mountain snow back to the region. Onshore flow will
keep lowland temperatures above freezing. A trough will bring
additional showers on Saturday with more snow in the mountains and
passes. Snow levels drop to around 500-1000 ft Saturday night with
a rain/snow mix possible in the lowlands. NBM probabilities show
around 15-20 percent chance of seeing greater than 1 inch in the
interior with around a 30 percent chance Everett north and the
coast. Cool conditions with additional threats of lowland snow are
possible into early next week. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge centered offshore through Monday.
Northeasterly flow aloft becoming northerly this afternoon. In the
lower levels offshore gradients weakening slightly into Monday.

Upslope stratus along the north slopes of the Olympics and some
patchy fog over the Kitsap Peninsula this morning. The fog will
clear by 19z with the stratus dissipating by 21z. Lighter surface
gradients Monday morning could lead to a slight increase in fog
coverage over the Southwest Interior as well as sheltered river
valleys. Outside of that just a few high clouds through Monday.

KSEA...Just a few high clouds. Variable winds less than 5 knots
becoming northerly 4 to 8 knots around 21z. Winds becoming light
and variable again late tonight. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface ridging strengthens over interior British
Columbia and east of the Cascades while a broad surface trough
deepens well to the south over California. As this pattern is not
expected to change for the first half of the week, northerly or weak
onshore flow is expected to persist. The next front will approach
the coastal waters around the middle to later half of next week.

Seas 4 to 6 ft today before diminishing slightly Monday down to 3 to
5 ft and remaining in this range at least through midweek. Wave
heights rebound back to 4 to 6 ft around Thursday with arrival of
the aforementioned front.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
