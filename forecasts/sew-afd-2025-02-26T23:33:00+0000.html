Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
333 PM PST Wed Feb 26 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Drier and warmer conditions today as ridging remains
over the area. A splitting front will weaken on Thursday with the
chance of some light showers. Conditions will dry out on Friday
before troughing takes over the pattern with light precipitation
chances over the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Recent satellite imagery
shows some high level clouds over the region along with some
sunbreaks. Temperatures this afternoon will have warmed up in the
upper 50s, with some locations even in the 60s. Dry conditions
will continue into the overnight period.

A splitting front will attempt to approach our area into Thursday,
but will weaken and split as it pushes across the region. As it
does, light showers are still possible, but mainly over the coast
and the Northern Interior areas. Precipitation totals again will
be light - around a few hundredths of an inch if anything. High
temperatures will largely remain the same, in the upper 50s and
again potentially hitting 60 degrees.

Upper level ridging will build into the region on Friday for
another day for drier and warmer conditions, with temps in the
upper 50s. Uncertainty lies in the pattern over the weekend, with
most ensemble guidance showing the aforementioned upper level
ridge shifting eastward allowing troughing to redevelop over
western Washington. Troughing looks to somewhat split off the main
flow and eject further south, towards California.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...As troughing ejects from
the main flow, there could be some wrap around moisture aimed
towards our region mostly on Sunday for chances of showers. This
unsettled pattern looks to largely continue into the long term
period, with periods of light precipitation at times. At this
time, no significant weather impacts are expected. Temperatures
look to cool some, with highs in the low to mid 50s and overnight
lows in the 30s to 40s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak upper ridge remains over the region today with
westerly flow aloft. The flow aloft will become southwesterly
tonight as a dissipating frontal system approaches the area. Low
level offshore flow will turn weakly onshore on Thursday. The
combination of high level moisture streaming over the area and low
level offshore flow will limit patchy LIFR fog formation late
tonight and Thursday morning to extreme south Puget Sound and the
Southwest Interior.

KSEA...VFR with increasing high level moisture. Surface winds N/NE 5
to 7 knots backing to E/SE near or after 00Z then light southerly by
daybreak Thursday.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface ridging centered east of the Cascades will weaken
on Thursday as a dissipating frontal system moves into Western
Washington. Weak high pressure will briefly rebuild on Friday before
another trough digs southward across the offshore waters Saturday
into Sunday. A weak trough will remain over area waters on Monday
before high pressure rebuilds offshore heading into the middle of
next week.

Coastal seas will be near or above 10 feet into Saturday before
subsiding into single digits early next week.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>most all rivers have crested from this last event and
are receding with the exception of the lower Skookumchuck and
Chehalis Rivers - not counting a couple of river points below
dams that are releasing the extra runoff. All flood watches and
warnings are end or soon will be. No additional flooding is
expected for the next 7 days.
