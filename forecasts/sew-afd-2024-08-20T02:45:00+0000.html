Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
745 PM PDT Mon Aug 19 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A series of weather systems will impact the region
through the end of the week. This will result in occasional rounds
of showers and isolated thunderstorms as well as temperatures
running 5-10 degrees below normal.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery does an
excellent job of showing the upper level low just off the WA coast.
this system will be the main driver of the weather overnight tonight
and throughout the day Tuesday as it moves eastward. Latest obs and
radar suggest that precip with the leading edge of this low is more
of a scattered nature as Forks and Shelton are reporting rain while
Hoquiam and Port Angeles have not. PoPs might be a touch overdone
for this evening but looks to self-correct beyond 11 PM PDT tonight,
leaving the overall trend looking good. That said, will leave
inherited forecast as is.

For additional forecast details, please refer to the Previous
Discussion section below.

From Previous Discussion...The remnant upper level low that brought
us showers/thunderstorms over the weekend continues to spin off the
coast today and is resulting in rain along the coast. This low will
fill and eventually move across western Washington during the day
Tuesday. Cool mid-level temperatures associated with this low will
create modestly unstable conditions during the day Tuesday allowing
for the development of widespread showers and isolated weak
thunderstorms throughout the day. Brief heavy rain, lightning, small
hail, and erratic winds would be the main threats with any storms
that form.
This progression will also drag a cold front across the region,
bringing temperatures down some 5-10 degrees across the board.

Quick on the heels of the remnant low, a deepening low will shift
south from the BC coast Wednesday down to the CA/OR border by
Thursday evening. This will result in the potential for yet more
shower and thunderstorm activity gradually shifting southward
Wednesday and Thursday as well as continued cool temperatures.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...By Friday, the upper level
low is likely to begin lifting from the CA/OR border northeast
across the Great Basin/Intermountain West. This will allow at
least some weak upper level ridging to try to nose into the PNW
and decreasing the overall precipitation/convective activity
Friday. Fast moving disturbances in the flow may impact the area
by Saturday but confidence in the details really begins to fall
off. There is a weak favoring of ridging resulting in warmer/drier
conditions for Sunday and beyond.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>S/SW flow aloft. Upper level low remains offshore
through Tuesday morning then shifting inland in the afternoon, with
showers increasing across western WA. Isolated thunderstorms are
possible as the low moves inland. Ceilings remain VFR for the most
part but could see patchy morning low clouds in the SW interior.

KSEA...VFR tonight with S/SW winds around 5-8 kt. Vicinity showers
increase by 18z with a 10 percent chance of thunderstorms.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure offshore will gradually weaken on Tuesday
with generally light winds over the waters. A weak front will
dissipate over the Coastal Waters Wednesday night. Onshore flow
increases later in the week with stronger westerly pushes through
the strait. Wave heights generally 4 to 6 ft through the period.
