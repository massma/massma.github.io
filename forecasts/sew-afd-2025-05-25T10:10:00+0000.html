Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
310 AM PDT Sun May 25 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak front will produce cooler temperatures and a
round of showers late today through Monday. Ridging will rebound
by Tuesday for a return of warmer and dry conditions into the
middle of the week. Another weak front is expected on Thursday
with warmer and drier conditions returning at the end of the week
as an upper ridge rebuilds over the area.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Clouds will start to
increase by afternoon and onshore flow will increase as a weak
front approaches Western Washington today. A few showers will
reach coastal areas by this evening. A dissipating front and
associated upper trough axis will spread some shower activity into
the interior by early Monday A.M., but QPF remains on the light
side. Olympic rain shadowing will limit totals around Puget Sound
to a few hundredths at best. Upper ridging starts to rebuild into
the area Monday night and Tuesday. The low level low turns
northerly on Tuesday as thermally induced low pressure expands
northward along the coast. A warming trend will commence with
highs from the mid and upper 60s coast to mid 70s across the
Southwest Interior.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...The upper ridge axis shifts
east of the area on Wednesday as thermal troughing at the surface shifts
into the interior of Western Washington. Wednesday is shaping up
to be the warmest day of the year thus far with widespread highs
in the mid 70s to mid 80s away from the immediate coast. Another
weak system is slated to reach the area on Thursday, but may not
produce much more than a short-term cooling trend and some light
precip on the Olympic Peninsula. Models are in fairly good
agreement with upper ridging rebounding at the end of the week for
a return to dry conditions and temperatures several degrees above
normal for the end of May. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
