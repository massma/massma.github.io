Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
1016 AM PDT Sat Aug 3 2024

.SYNOPSIS...High pressure aloft through the weekend with
continued above normal temperatures and dry weather. However,
increased onshore flow will bring near-normal conditions on
Tuesday before warming up shortly afterwards. Nearby disturbances
may usher marginal thunderstorm potential over the Cascades into
next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The marine stratus layer
spread into much of western Washington this morning. Satellite is
already beginning to show it dissipating over the Seattle metro,
and the layer will rapidly burn off within the next few hours.
With clear skies, warming will be rapid, and still on track to
reach the mid 70s to mid 90s across the region. LH

Previous Discussion...The Four Corners high remains in place and
won`t progress much in the next several days. As a result, its
influence continues here in W WA as dry conditions reign. For
today we`re in store for more warm temperatures throughout the
interior with highs topping into the mid to upper 80s. It`ll be
much cooler along the coast and San Juans with 60s and 70s in
store. CAMs are showing precipitation tracking northward into the
region throughout the day but SW flow aloft should steer it clear
of the area. Tonight, W WA will see another round of stratus into
Sunday morning with less intrusion. Low temperatures are to range
between to 50s and 60s.

Much of the same for both Sunday and Monday although, a gently
moving shortwave trough will camp out along the coast. This
feature is helping to keep a slight (15%) chance of showers over
the far northern Cascades but current guidance suggest most of the
moisture should stay well east. Can`t rule out a strike of
lightning during this time. Temperatures again are to top out in
the mid to upper 80s with 60s along the coast. Overnight lows of
50s and 60s are to persist as well.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Deterministic guidance has
the aforementioned shortwave tracking across WA Monday through
Wednesday. Will have to monitor the continued threat for elevation
convection. By Thursday, ensembles and deterministic models are
hinting at a upper-low drifting southward out of Alberta/BC and
upper-ridging upstream over the NE Pac. Can`t rule out additional
precipitation chances during this time.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The region remains placed in between an upper trough
over the northeastern Pacific and a strong ridge centered near the
Rockies, maintaining southwest flow across the region. Monsoonal
moisture remains to the south and east today, with associated storms
away from the local area. Onshore low level flow maintains some
stratus near the coast and into portions of Puget Sound this
morning, with scattering through the day bringing a return to VFR
conditions. Continued onshore flow should bring IFR marine stratus
at least partway inland again on Sunday morning.

KSEA...Low stratus has scattered with VFR conditions under clear
skies expected today and into tonight. Low confidence in stratus
potential for Sunday morning. Surface winds light southwesterly this
morning, becoming west/northwest this afternoon and into the
evening.    Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A static summer pattern is expected over the next
several days with a broad surface ridge centered well offshore and
lower pressure inland for varying degrees of onshore flow. Diurnally
driven increases in the westerlies through the strait will come
close to or exceed small advisory levels on a near daily basis.
Persist northwest winds over the outer coastal waters will lead
to some choppy conditions through the weekend. Otherwise, a fairly
quiet period is expected to continue. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
