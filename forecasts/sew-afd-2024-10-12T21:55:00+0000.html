Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
255 PM PDT Sat Oct 12 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge over western Canada and
Washington ill produce dry and mild conditions this weekend. The
weather becomes more fall like next week with as multiple frontal
systems impact the region via atmospheric rivers. The potential
exists for substantial rainfall, high mountain snow, and locally
gusty winds, especially in the second half of the work week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Morning fog coverage has
completely cleared (based on visible satellite), and blue sky
dominates western Washington this afternoon, thanks to an upper
level ridge over the state and up into western Canada.
Most places are seeing temperatures in the 60s (just after 1 PM
PDT) - and they will continue to rise into the upper 60s to low
70s this afternoon. Sunday will be a similar start to Saturday
morning, with low cloud/fog coverage in the morning (especially
south of Puget Sound). Any low cloud/fog coverage will lift up by
mid to late Sunday morning, with a few more clouds hanging around
Sunday afternoon (and upper 60s/low 70s for highs).

The pattern changes late Sunday night/Monday as the ridge begins
to depart the region, giving way to a large-scale upper level low
and trough from Alaska digging down the Pacific coastline. The
jet max will help funnel in limited moisture from the Pacific
(setting this system up as a weaker atmospheric river event Monday
through Tuesday via a cold front). Rainfall amounts with this
first system will be light, with mean average QPF totals right now
averaging around a tenth to a quarter of an inch in the lowlands,
half an inch for the north Cascades, and half an inch to an inch
along the coast/Olympics. The 25th and 75th percentiles of the NBM
fluctuates the previously mentioned estimates by a tenth to two
tenths of an inch of precipitation. Will continue to monitor and
fine tune potential totals getting closer to the system`s arrival.

Additionally, there`s an increase in the potential of sneaker
waves along the coastline Monday (which may impact anyone
recreating along the coastline, including beaches). The front will
also bring cooler temperatures, with highs dropping to around 60
by Tuesday (lows still in the 40s and 50s).

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...A second atmospheric
river event is expected to impact the region Wednesday through
Friday. Ensembles show that the trough axis (and an additional
cold front) will move across the state Wednesday, with a surface
trough and strong jet max on the back side of the trough peaking
at over 130 knots. This will funnel more moisture into the region
for what will likely be several days of continuous precipitation
across western Washington. What people across western Washington
will likely see with this system is first: breezy winds with the
front coming through Wednesday (right now appears local areas may
see gusts at or over 20 mph), snow levels dropping to around 4,000
feet (producing snow at elevations at or greater than that
level), and periods of rain. With this system still being 4 days
out, amounts are still hard to pin down (due to the wide range of
possible totals in the NBM). Once the system gets closer and
confidence in the amounts increase, the forecast details will be
more fine-tuned, with this being the first fall-like system in the
state.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>South to southeasterly flow today as an upper ridge
remains over the area and an upper low moves across Oregon. Skies
have cleared for VFR conditions throughout western Washington.
Confidence in a return of lower cigs and visbys of 2 miles or less
overnight has grown to around 80 to 90 percent along the coast
beginning around 08Z, with around 50 percent probabilities of visbys
below 2 miles spreading into Puget Sound by 12Z. Similar timing of
ceiling lift on Sunday as it occurred today, around 18Z to 19Z, is
expected. Thereafter, expect a VFR afternoon with light surface
flow. Conditions will change late Sunday night into Monday as the
first of two atmospheric rivers bring rain and breezy conditions
back to the area.

KSEA...VFR conditions are present at the terminal this afternoon
after a foggy start. Surface flow will turn from a southwesterly
direction back to a light southeasterly by 03Z this evening. Another
round of fog is likely again on Sunday morning, spreading in from
the south Sound by 10Z. A similar breakout time of 18Z is likely for
Sunday as well for another VFR afternoon. Changes in the pattern
will be well underway by late Sunday into Monday as the first of two
atmospheric rivers arrives bringing more rain and lower cigs.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over Western Washington will result in
generally light southeasterly/offshore flow today. Light winds are
expected for the interior waters with south to southeast winds over
the Coastal Waters into Sunday. Southerly winds will increase,
especially for the Coastal Waters, Sunday afternoon into Monday
morning as a front moves across Western Washington. At this time,
there is approximately a 60-80% chance of Small Craft Advisory winds
for the majority of the Coastal Waters, with the highest
probabilities along the outer Coastal Waters. Have opted to pass the
issuance of any potential small craft advisories to the next
forecast period for the latest information to be evaluated then.
That said, headlines are likely. Heightened seas Monday into Tuesday
will pose additional beach hazards, discussed in the short term
section of the discussion. South winds will also increase for
portions of the interior waters Monday morning, particularly
Admiralty Inlet and eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca, but SCA winds
are not expected at this time. Otherwise, a potentially stronger
front looks to move through Tuesday night into Wednesday for another
period of breezy winds. In addition, a post-frontal westerly push is
expected through the Strait of Juan de Fuca later on Wednesday.

Seas will build to 6 to 8 feet this afternoon into Sunday. In the
southern portion of the coastal waters, caution should be exercised
throughout this evening as there is potential for nearly squared
seas into Sunday. Seas will then build further to 11 to 13 feet
Sunday night into Monday. Seas may briefly subside below 10 feet on
Tuesday, before seas may build above 10 feet Wednesday and into
Thursday.

.HYDROLOGY...Signals for two atmospheric rivers early next week are
appearing in the forecast. The first will arrive late Sunday night
into Monday, and a second following in short succession Tuesday into
Wednesday. The second one looks to be somewhat stronger in terms of
integrated water vapor transport and forecast precipitation amounts
into western Washington, though there is considerable uncertainty
and model run-to-run variability. With these two systems in quick
succession next week, significant rises in area rivers will be
expected. Currently, no rivers are forecast to rise into action or
minor flood stage at this time, but the potential will continue to
be monitored and evaluated.
