Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
214 PM PDT Thu Jun 6 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Warming and dry conditions will continue through
Saturday. High pressure will move east of the area beginning
Sunday with occasional weak systems through next week allowing
temperatures to gradual cool to around normal.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure continues to
build across the western U.S. resulting in increasing temperatures
through Saturday. Little change to the forecast from 24 hours ago
with HeatRisk solidly in the yellow/minor category except for a
few very isolated areas of orange/moderate in the Cascade
Foothills and perhaps some urban heat islands. The high pressure
ridge axis shifts east on Sunday opening the door for weak waves
to move into the region bringing some onshore flow, additional
clouds, and perhaps some light shower activity to the mountains.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...The average pattern will
remain fairly static through much of next week with the region
sandwiched between a ridge over the intermountain west or central
US and a trough over the eastern Pacific ejecting occasional
waves across the region. This will result in temperatures trending
back towards normal. The area will remain mostly dry though
occasional light precipitation cannot be completely ruled out.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West-southwest flow aloft veering more west-
northwesterly into early Friday as upper-level ridging amplifies
upstream. Mostly clear skies (VFR) expected throughout the TAF
period with high clouds streaming overhead at times. Can`t rule out
patchy fog developing in river valleys and near coastal areas into
the overnight/early morning hours. Northerly winds throughout most
TAF sites 5-10 kt with isolated higher gusts.

KSEA...VFR cigs with high clouds at times throughout the TAF period.
N/NW 5 to 10 kt this afternoon with a 20-30% chance for isolated
gusts around 15 kt, continuing overnight into Friday also.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>1026 mb surface high is currently positioned over the
offshore waters of BC with northerlies over the coastal waters. Winds
are expected to remain below SCA threshold however, onshore flow
will increase Saturday night into Sunday bringing westerly SCA winds
through the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Seas below 10 ft, between 5 to 8
ft through Saturday. Seas will then build Saturday night into
Sunday, with seas potentially approaching 10 feet for the outer
Coastal Waters Saturday night into Sunday and possibly again around
midweek.
