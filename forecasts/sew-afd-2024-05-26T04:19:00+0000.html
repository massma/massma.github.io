Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
919 PM PDT Sat May 25 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Showery and cooler conditions will continue into
Sunday as an upper level trough moves through the region. Upper
level ridging will slowly begin to build east of our area through
Monday for slightly warmer temps, with troughing over the Pacific
still keeping an influence over western Washington. A frontal
system will move through on Tuesday for another bout of rain and
cooler temperatures.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Radar imagery continues
to show isolated showers across western Washington, particularly
over the Cascades, the Pacific Coastal regions, and through the
northern Hood Canal up towards Port Townsend. These showers are
being forced by a weak departing upper-level trough. Low
temperatures tonight into the upper 40s.

A weak frontal system will eject from a large upper level trough
in the Gulf of Alaska and move through the northern part of our
area tomorrow, weakening as it does so. The North Coast, the
Northwest Interior, and the Cascades will receive the bulk of the
rain, leaving only a few light showers with minimal accumulations
expected for the remained of the region. Mostly dry conditions are
expected south and east of Seattle. High temperatures similar to
today, in the mid to upper 50s.

An upper level ridge will start to build east of our area, in the
Interior West, while broad troughing offshore will remain close
enough to keep an influence over western Washington. Temperatures
will also warm up a little on Memorial Day, with high temps in the
upper 60s in the interior lowlands, while locations near the
water will be in the lower 60s. Shower chances increase through
the evening and into Tuesday morning as a frontal system
approaches the area while the upper trough digs southward. Showers
will start to push in through the interior Tuesday afternoon and
largely continue into Wednesday.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Extended ensemble
guidance agrees on upper level troughing continuing through
late Wednesday, with showers decreasing in coverage on Thursday.
Cluster guidance are in agreement on an upper level ridge
building offshore western Washington into the weekend, providing
drier and warmer conditions.
