Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
353 PM EST Mon Feb 24 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Offshore high pressure will move farther out to sea through
Tuesday morning as a warm front passes well to the north. A cold
front will approach Tuesday afternoon and move through Tuesday
night. High pressure will briefly build in on Wednesday before a
frontal system moves through Wednesday night through Friday.
High pressure will return Friday night, with another frontal
system potentially impacting the area Saturday and Saturday
night. High pressure will then build in and remain in control
through early next week.

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM TUESDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Bkn stratocu across interior SE CT via onshore flow via combo of
low level warm/moist advection on S flow should dissipate this
evening after loss of daytime heating. Thereafter an expansive
area of bkn high clouds across PA back into the OH valley should
overspread the area, with partly cloudy skies. High cloud cover
plus low level WAA should lead to low temps a few degrees
warmer than those of last night, with lows near 40 in NYC, in
the 30s most elsewhere, perhaps still some upper 20s in the
valleys of Orange County.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An amplifying upper trough will approach daytime Tue, with an
associated weak cold front approaching in the afternoon and
passing through in the evening, accompanied by a few rain
showers mainly inland during the late afternoon and early
evening. Before these showers arrive expect BKN high and mid
level clouds to dominate, with a low level S-SW flow leading to
an even milder day. Sided with the milder side of MOS guidance
showing high temps reaching the lower/mid 50s away from south
facing shorelines where temps will be limited to the upper 40s.

Skies clear out during the late evening and overnight, though
some lake effect clouds may encroach on areas N/W of NYC as a
weak secondary sfc trough moves through late. Low temps Tue
night should be similar to those fcst for tonight, near 40 in
NYC and in the 30s elsewhere.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...

<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Key Points:

* Active period with the potential for two frontal systems to
  move through. The first is expected to bring light rain
  Thursday into Thursday night and the second may bring a light
  wintry mix Saturday into Saturday night.

* Above normal temperatures expected on Wednesday and Thursday
  drop back to near normal on Friday and Saturday and below
  normal Sunday and Monday.

Weak ridging builds into the area at the surface and aloft on
Wednesday. This will lead to mostly sunny skies, dry
conditions and above normal temperatures.

Heights aloft start to lower Wednesday night as a frontal
system approaches. The warm front looks to move through sometime
Thursday morning, with the cold front moving through Thursday
afternoon. Given the track of the low center being to our north,
temperatures in our area will be warm enough for an all plain
rain event.

A secondary cold front looks to move through on Friday.
Latest guidance has been pretty consistent in a quick
tightening of the pressure gradient over the area with this
secondary push. Went closer to the NBM 90th percentile with
winds and wind gusts giving sustained winds around 20 mph and
gusts up to 30 mph for Friday.

After brief high pressure Friday night, another low will
approach. With some colder air to work with, this low could
bring us a wintry mix. Uncertainty still remains, so stuck with
rain/snow showers. QPF amounts do not look impressive, likely
under a tenth of an inch of liquid. High pressure then builds in
and remains in control Sunday and Monday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /21Z MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure continues to move offshore today as a frontal
system approaches from the west tonight. A cold front moves
through the terminals Tuesday afternoon into the evening.

VFR through Tuesday early afternoon. There is a chance of -SHRA
with MVFR conditions, mainly for ceilings, after 18Z Tuesday,
but due to low confidence, included this possibility with a
Prob30. KSWF more likely to go MVFR than the NYC terminals.

SE-S wind 10-15 kt with perhaps a bit stronger at KJFK and KLGA.
Some gusts to 20kt remain possible into this evening mainly for
the NYC terminals. Winds veer slightly to the SSW this evening
and drop to around 5-10 kt or less. Continuing SSW wind 5-10 kt
after daybreak tomorrow before shifting to the W/NW late in the
day after a frontal passage.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Occasional gusts to 20 kt possible this evening.

.OUTLOOK FOR 21Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

Tuesday: Mainly VFR. Slight chance of showers and MVFR
conditions after 18Z.

Wednesday: VFR.

Thursday: Showers with MVFR or lower possible. S-SW winds
G15-20kt in the afternoon.

Friday: VFR. NW winds G15-25kt.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Wind gusts on the ocean waters may approach but fall short of 25
kt, while seas briefly build as high as 4 ft.

SCA conditions expected on the ocean waters Thu through Fri
night with 5+ ft seas. SCA conditions should hold off on the non
ocean waters until Friday, when 25-30 kt gusts are forecast.

SCA conditions are also briefly possible on the ocean waters on
Sat with the passage of another frontal system.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
