Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
857 AM PDT Wed Aug 14 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Mostly cloudy skies will persist through the morning,
with afternoon sunshine and near normal temperatures this
afternoon. The pattern looks to trend wetter into the weekend
with what amounts to a good chance of widespread precipitation for
much of the region.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No significant changes made
to the forecast this morning. The previous discussion can be found
below along with updated aviation and marine sections:

Weak high pressure replaces the trough that was over western WA
over the past few days. This, along with lighter onshore flow,
will result in slightly warmer weather and less clouds (more
sunbreaks) this afternoon. Highs in the interior will reach the
mid to upper 70s with cooler 60s along the coast.

On Thursday, weak troughing sets up over the Pac NW once again.
This brings more clouds, mountain showers and cooler temps. There
is a slight chance of thunderstorms in the north Cascades near the
crest.

An upper level low drops down from Canada and spins offshore as we
move into Friday. This pattern places western WA under moist,
diffluent flow with additional showers and possible thunderstorms
in the Cascades. Onshore flow and lower heights keep temps across
the region cooler than average. 33

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The upper level low will
continue to spin offshore through the weekend and into early next
week. Western WA is under moist and unstable S/SW flow for a
chance of showers and thunderstorms Saturday and Sunday. Moving
forward, there`s a break in the precip (for the most part) Monday
and Tuesday as showers remain offshore. Ensemble members show more
rain possibilities by midweek as the low finally drifts inland.
Below average temperatures continue through the period. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light, variable flow aloft today as brief ridging builds
into the area. Mostly VFR cigs this morning with areas of MVFR/IFR
along the coast and across the northern Olympic Peninsula. Cigs will
clear through early afternoon for some lingering SCT mid-level
clouds later today. Stratus will develop again this evening along
the coast and move inland towards Puget Sound into Thursday morning.
Generally LIFR/IFR cigs along the coast and southern Puget Sound
Thursday morning, with lowering cigs in central Puget Sound as well.
Light winds this morning will increase W/NW this afternoon.

KSEA...VFR cigs this morning, with a brief chance of MVFR cigs
between 16-18z. Otherwise, VFR this afternoon and evening. Cigs will
lower again Thursday morning towards MVFR, with a 30% chance of MVFR
cigs mainly between 13-18z. Light winds this morning will increase
N/NW between 18-20z, ranging 6 to 9kts this afternoon and evening. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...Low visibilities through the morning along the
inner Coastal Waters and Strait of Juan de Fuca in fog. Onshore flow
will continue for the majority of this week across the area waters
with diurnally driven westerly pushes through the Strait of Juan de
Fuca each evening. Winds will near SCA criteria later this evening,
though confidence not high enough at this time to issue a Small
Craft. Confidence is higher for Thursday with a stronger push
through the Strait of Juan de Fuca expected.

Seas will remain 3 to 4 feet through Thursday and briefly build to 5
to 6 feet along the outer Coastal Waters on Friday.
