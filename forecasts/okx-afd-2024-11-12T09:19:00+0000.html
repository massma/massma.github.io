Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
419 AM EST Tue Nov 12 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Strong high pressure builds in today through tonight. High
pressure slowly moves farther northward away from the region
Wednesday into Wednesday night. A weakening frontal system will
approach from the west on Thursday while an ocean storm passes
well to the east and moves into the Canadian Maritimes. This
storm will then remain over the Canadian Maritimes into Monday
as another high builds into the region Sunday into early next
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Strong high pressure builds in today. Steep pressure gradient
between the high pressure over the Great Lakes and low pressure
over the Canadian Maritimes. This will create very gusty NW
flow.

More sun, more drying expected today. Fire weather much more of
concern today with a red flag warning in effect for all forecast
zones. See fire weather section for more details.

Used a blend of MAV and MET mos for high temperatures which will
be much cooler than the previous day, staying in the 50s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will continue building into the region tonight.
Steep enough of a pressure gradient to keep gusty winds but
magnitude will be decreasing after the first few hours of this
evening.

Dry conditions continue but the winds will help mitigate
radiational cooling with mostly clear sky conditions.

Forecast lows a blend of MAV and MET, ranging from mid 20s to
upper 30s.

For Wednesday through Wednesday night, the high pressure will
slowly move farther northward away from the local region. Dry
conditions will continue. Ridging aloft with a weakening of the
surface pressure gradient will allow for winds to decrease and
gusty to lower.

Colder airmass will continue to encompass the region with high
temperatures forecast to only reach upper 40s to near 50. For
Wednesday night with nearly clear sky conditions continuing plus
diminishing winds, efficient radiational cooling is expected.
More vast range of lows are forecast from upper teens to upper
30s.

For Thursday, clouds increase as a weakening frontal system
approaches. Conditions are forecast to remain dry. Forecast
highs will be relatively similar to the previous day.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mainly dry weather continues through much of the extended
period with only slight chances of precipitation across portions
of the region Thursday night through Friday morning.
Precipitation across western portions of the region during this
time frame will be associated with a weakening frontal system,
and little to no precipitation may fall, as forcing is weak, and
weakens as the system passes to the southwest. Low end chance
is possible across the south fork of Long Island Friday night as
an offshore low retrogrades into the Canadian Maritime under a
weakening Omega block, pushing some moisture toward the forecast
areas.

Temperatures below normal Thursday, slightly above normal for Friday
and Saturday, and 5 or more degrees above normal Sunday into the
beginning of next week.

With the NBM handling the weather rather well, with little deviation
from the deterministic, and with most parameters similar to the
previous forecast, have mainly followed the NBM. Only deviation was
for winds and gusts during the northwest and north flow regimes
Saturday and Monday as high pressure builds into the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /09Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A secondary cold front will push offshore through daybreak Tuesday
which will be followed by strong high pressure building in from the
Great Lakes region later Tuesday morning. Occasional gusts of 30 to
35 kt are possible through daybreak in the wake of the cold frontal
passage. More frequent gusts of around 30 kt are expected later this
morning into the afternoon (see below).

VFR through the TAF period.

A secondary cold front passes through (06z-08z) and increases the
winds and shifts them to the NW. Sustained speeds of 15-20 kt with
gusts 25-30 kt are then expected into Tuesday morning and afternoon.
Some peak gusts around 35 kt are possible. The gusts are expected to
remain into Tuesday evening.

     NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB)TAF Uncertainty...

Uncertainty around the magnitude of peak gusts, around 35 kt gusts
possible Tuesday.

OUTLOOK FOR 06Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

Late Tuesday night: VFR. N winds gradually diminishing overnight
with gusts ending.

Wednesday-Thursday: VFR. Slight chance of a shower Thursday Night
near the coast.

Friday-Saturday: VFR. NW wind gusts 15-20 kt possible Friday and NW
wind gusts 20-25 kt possible Saturday.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>SCA in effect for all forecast waters through tonight. Then on
Wednesday, a gradual decrease of winds is expected. First waters
to drop below SCA will be NY Harbor and Western LI Sound (by 6AM
Wednesday). This will be followed by the rest of the non-ocean
zones dropping below SCA (by 9AM Wednesday). Then the western
ocean (Sandy Hook NJ to Fire Island Inlet NY) drops below SCA by
12PM Wednesday and lastly the rest of the ocean zones east of
Fire Island Inlet dropping below SCA (by 6PM Wednesday). There
is potential for SCA conditions lingering on the ocean east of
Fire Island Inlet for Wednesday night and Thursday with
otherwise sub-SCA conditions for the local waters.

Winds and seas will be below advisory levels on the waters into late
Friday. Late Friday into Saturday there is the potential for
marginal SCA conditions on the eastern ocean waters as northwest
winds and gusts increase as offshore low pressure passes to the
east.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>With low levels drying out today as NW winds increase with more
frequent gusts, the environment will become more conducive to
brush fire spread. Minimum RH is forecast to lower to near to just
below 30 percent for much of the region with frequent wind gusts
of near 30 to 35 mph expected as well. Due to these expected
conditions and after coordination with surrounding forecast
offices with input from land managers, a red flag warning is in
effect for the entire local forecast region including NE NJ,
NYC, Lower Hudson Valley, Southern CT and Long Island from 9AM
this morning to 6PM this evening.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Moderate drought conditions continue per US Drought Monitor.
Stream flows are generally below the 25th percentile of normal
for this time of year. There are no hydrologic concerns through
early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
