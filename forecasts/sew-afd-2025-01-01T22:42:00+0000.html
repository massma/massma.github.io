Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
242 PM PST Wed Jan 1 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Another weak system will bring showers to the region
tonight through Thursday. Breezy easterly winds will develop
along the west slopes of the Cascades and along the coast Thursday
through Friday morning. This will be followed by widespread
rain and mountain snow Friday into the weekend. Relatively dry
conditions are expected by early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Just a few isolated
showers remain out there this afternoon across western Washington.
Additional weak waves of precipitation will spread across the
region tonight through Thursday bringing light rain and mountain
snow. If enough cooling can occur between waves there could be a
slight chance few wet snowflakes mixed in with the rain in lowland
areas from roughly south Everett and Fall City northward.
However, no accumulation is expected.

Easterly winds are expected to gradually increase Thursday
afternoon through Friday morning before decreasing late Friday
morning. Favored areas such as the western slopes/foothills of the
Cascades as well as the Pacific Coast will see the highest wind
speeds. The most likely peak gusts are expected to be around 35
mph with a 15% chance of gusts to around 45 mph.

More widespread rain and mountain snow is expected Friday and
Saturday, with an additional wave on Sunday. This will be the
period with the highest precipitation totals. Still QPF amounts
will be such that only the Skokomish River in Mason County is at
risk of reaching flood stage. In the mountains, snow levels will
generally hover between 3000-4000 feet. While Snoqualmie Pass may
struggle to pick up significant snowfall at road level, the higher
mountains and passes will pick up several inches each day. This
time frame will be very borderline for Winter Weather Advisory
criteria and we will continue to monitor the forecast.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Longwave ridging attempts
to set up along the west coast next week which should result in
somewhat drier and warmer conditions. However, the details here
continue to vary between ensemble members. In general, Monday and
Tuesday favor the driest conditions. This could then be followed
by a period of dirty ridging with the region seeing occasional
glancing blows of systems moving over the top of the ridge.

The Climate Prediction Center 6-10 and 8-14 day outlooks indicate
the potential for this trend to continue into the week-2 time,
highlighting above-normal temperatures as well as near-normal
precipitation across far northern WA and below-normal
precipitation elsewhere.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West-northwesterly flow aloft turning more westerly
on Thursday. Winds aloft then turn more southwesterly on Thursday
night. VFR reported at all terminals this afternoon with the trend
lasting into the evening. However, lower ceilings are favored to
return overnight into Thursday morning. MVFR to localized IFR
(mainly for terminals such as KOLM and KPWT) are forecast to
maintain into the day on Thursday as rain showers return. E to SE
surface winds between 4 to 8 kt.


KSEA...VFR currently as conditions have since improved compared to
this morning. Tonight, VFR is likely to remain but lower ceilings
are favored to return by Thursday morning after 12z. Southeasterly
winds shifting more easterly this evening around 00Z before turning
more from the SE again on Thursday between 4 to 8 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An occluded surface low remains over the NE PAC with
higher pressure over the interior. This gradient will maintain SCA
over the coastal waters (mostly outer) and neighboring West Strait
due to winds late tonight into Thursday morning. As winds decrease
by Thursday afternoon, seas are to top out near 10 ft, maintaining
SCA conditions through at least Friday. On top of that, an
additional disturbance is forecast to track over the coastal waters
with gusty offshore winds with additional headlines likely through
the strait for Friday as well.

Seas 10 to 12 ft this evening before easing somewhat Thursday
morning. That said, the risk for seas exceeding 10 ft remains in
place into Thursday but mainly for the outer waters. Seas ramp up
again late Thursday night before peaking Friday afternoon at 10 to
13 ft before easing over the weekend.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Several weather systems will move across Western
Washington through the weekend resulting in additional
precipitation. Each of these systems will be fairly progressive
however, which will limit the total rainfall accumulation with
each system. At this time, the heaviest rainfall amounts are
expected over the southern Olympics, with amounts ranging 2 to 4
inches Friday through Sunday. This will result in rises on the
Skokomish River, which will approach flood stage over the weekend.
Although rises on rivers are expected elsewhere, no additional
river flooding is forecast.
