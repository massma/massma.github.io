Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
248 PM PDT Mon Apr 7 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>More rain and mountain snow through Tuesday with a
trough over the region. Weak upper level ridge trying to build
over the area Wednesday. The ridge will shift east Wednesday night
into Thursday allowing another front to reach the area Thursday
night. Cool upper level trough over Western Washington Friday and
Saturday with an upper level ridge building Sunday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>There is broad troughing
over the Pac NW with a parent low spinning offshore near the Gulf
of AK. Across western WA, we`re under moist S/SW flow with
batches of rain moving in and out. The air mass is slightly
unstable and there`s a chance of thunderstorms over the region
too. Snow levels will lower tonight, around 3500-4000 ft, and the
volcanoes may see periods of heavy snow. A Winter Storm Warning is
in effect with heaviest amounts over Mount Baker and Mount
Rainier (up to a foot of snow).

Wet weather continues into Tuesday with more rain and mountain
snow. Showers are enhanced with a passing trough axis due to cross
western WA during the afternoon. Heavy snow is still expected at
Mount Baker, Mount Rainier and White Pass. Snoqualmie will see a
rain/snow mix with around 4-6" at Stevens Pass. By Tuesday night,
we`ll be in post-frontal flow with showers and a convergence zone
aimed at Snohomish and Skagit counties.

A weak ridge will bring drier weather moving into Wednesday. The
air mass will be warmer with temps in the upper 50s to lower 60s.
The ridge holds on going forward to Thursday, keeping part of the
day dry. Rain returns late Thursday afternoon and evening as the
ridge shifts east and a front moves in from the Pacific. 33

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...A trough over the West will
keep rain chances going Friday through the weekend. Temperatures
will be cooler with morning lows in the 30s (beginning Saturday
morning). We`ll see light snow in the mountains as well. High
pressure brings drier weather later Sunday and into early next
week for a break in the weather. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Moist southwesterly flow aloft as upper level
troughing continues to bring showers to western Washington. A
mixed bag of conditions out there this afternoon from VFR to IFR
as heavier batches of showers move through. On and off shower
activity will continue into Tuesday as the aforementioned upper
level troughing moves onshore. Can expect lower conditions
(MVFR/IFR) at times throughout most of the terminals through the
overnight hours due to showers and low level moisture keeping
ceilings low. SW winds look to become breezy around 22z-02z, with
possible gusts up to 20 to 25 kts across the area.

KSEA...MVFR to VFR conditions out there this afternoon as batches
of showers continuously move through the terminal. Showers will
continue to move through into the evening, which will keep
conditions hovering around MVFR/VFR. Breezy S/SW winds around 12
to 16 knots this afternoon accompanied by gusts possible up 20 to
25 knots. Winds will slightly ease overnight but will remain
around 8 to 12 knots. Conditions look to remain at MVFR Tuesday
morning (15z-19z) as more showers move through the area, with
another round of breezy southerly winds.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system moving through the area waters will
keep winds slightly elevated over the coastal waters and the
interior waters. A small craft advisory remains in effect for the
coastal waters for elevated seas and winds, along with the Central
and Eastern Strait for a push of westerly winds ranging from
15-25 kts. Another disturbance will push through the waters on
Tuesday and will bring breezy southerlies across the waters. A
brief break from the weather through Wednesday and Thursday before
another system approaches the area near the end of the week.

Combined seas around 9 to 11 feet will generally remain through
Tuesday. Seas look to subside to around 5 to 7 feet by midweek,
before gradually building back up to 10 feet by the end of the
week.

the Olympics in the next 36 hours. The current forecast has the
river cresting just a few inches below flood stage late Tuesday
night. If the Skokomish River does reach flood stage, it will not
