.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
cloudy skies over Western Washington early this morning. Doppler
radar has widespread shower activity over the southern half of the
area and in the Cascades. Temperatures at 3 am/10z were in the
mid 40s to lower 50s.

Upper level trough over the area today with the trough axis
remaining offshore. Shower activity continuing throughout the day.
Temperatures aloft cooling with 500 mb temperatures -26 to -28C
this afternoon. Lapse rates in the 7-8C/km range this afternoon as
well. Will add a slight chance of thunderstorms to the showers
forecast this afternoon. Not much in the way of daytime heating
today with highs in the lower to mid 50s.

Little change in the pattern tonight. Upper level trough
remaining over the area with the trough axis still offshore.
Slight chance of thunderstorms in the early evening hours with
shower activity continuing into Tuesday morning. Lows in the lower
to mid 40s.

Upper level trough axis moving through Tuesday giving the area
more widespread shower activity especially in the morning to early
afternoon hours. Trough axis moving through the Puget Sound area
mid afternoon reaching the Cascades late in the day. Snow levels
near 3500 feet Monday night through Tuesday with the higher passes
getting a little snow. Good onshore push behind the trough axis
late in the day with southerly winds increasing. Highs remaining
in the lower to mid 50s.

Upper level trough quickly moving east Tuesday night with shower
activity decreasing over most of the area. The exception will be
in a convergence zone over Snohomish county. Southerly winds
gusting 30 to as high as 40 mph in the evening ( not good news for
the cherry blossoms ) easing overnight. Lows in the upper 30s to
mid 40s.

Upper level ridge building into the area from the south Wednesday.
The ridge is not very strong with 500 mb heights only rising to
the lower to mid 560 dms. A few lingering showers over the
northern portion of the area mainly in the morning. High clouds
embedded in the southwesterly flow aloft so will keep the forecast
wording partly sunny. Highs near normal, mid 50s to lower 60s.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement with the upper level ridge shifting east and another
frontal system approaching the area Thursday. Front still offshore
at 00z Friday for rain likely along the coast and a chance of rain
inland Thursday afternoon.

Front moving through Western Washington Thursday night for another
round of rain for the area.

Upper level trough behind the front hanging out over Western
Washington Friday with the trough axis moving through Saturday
keeping showers in the forecast. Highs a little below normal, in
the lower to mid 50s.

Confidence not real high in the day 7 forecast with the models
still not showing a lot of run to run consistency. ECMWF much more
agressive with the ridge building versus the GFS which has a warm
front to the northwest late in the day. Ensembles are pretty dry
on both models with 10 percent or less of the ensemble solutions
showing light precipitation. With the GFS indicating a front
nearby will keep the wording partly sunny with a slight chance of
showers mainly on the coast. Highs a little warmer Sunday, in the
mid to upper 50s. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft as troughing remains offshore.
Mixed ceilings (VFR/MVFR/IFR) so far this morning. Rain has
transitioned to showers allowing a brief reprieve for some
terminals. However, steadier rain will return this morning allowing
more widespread MVFR/IFR cigs & vis with isolated LIFR in the cards
as well. SW winds will become breezy this afternoon with gusts
upwards of 20-25 kt. VFR cigs may return after 00z but low-level
moisture will keep low clouds around overnight into early Tuesday.


KSEA...Conditions are favored to trend MVFR most of the day with
rain and showers in the forecast. Light SE winds this morning will
increase out of the S-SW with gusts around 25 kt this afternoon.
Can`t rule out gusts near 30 kt.  A period of VFR cigs are slated
after 00z but a mixed bag of VFR/MVFR is possible overnight into
early Tuesday as rain and showers persists.

.MARINE...A SCA remains in effect for the coastal waters through
this evening. Additional SCAs have gone into effect for the
central/east strait later this morning through the evening as a
quick burst of westerlies up to 25-30 kt are possible during the
afternoon today. The next disturbance will arrive on Tuesday with
more breezy winds and probabilities for SCAs. High pressure briefly
builds over the region Wednesday into Thursday before the next low
pressure system looks to arrive Thursday night into Friday.

Seas will remain at around to 9 to 10 ft today. Seas then gradually
decrease around 8 to 9 ft Tuesday before relaxing to 5 to 7 ft
Wednesday. The next system Thursday night may raise seas above 10 ft
once again.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The combination of the river already running high and
2 to 2.5 inches of rain along the south slopes of the Olympics in
the next 36 hours have issued a flood watch for the Skokomish
River in Mason county. The current forecast has the river cresting
just a few inches below flood stage late Tuesday night. If the
river does reach flood stage it will not remain over flood stage
long with the watch ending Wednesday morning.

No river flooding on the remainder of the rivers in the next 7
days. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
