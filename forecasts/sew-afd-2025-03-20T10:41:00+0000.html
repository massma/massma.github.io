Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
341 AM PDT Thu Mar 20 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Scattered showers will continue across western
Washington this morning in the wake of a frontal system. Another
system will move into the region tonight into Friday and will
bring the next round of lowland rain, mountain snow, and breezy
winds to the area. The pattern looks to remain active through the
weekend, with the potential for an atmospheric river to set up
over the region late in the weekend into early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Scattered shower activity
will continue through the morning in the wake of a frontal system
that moved across the region. Gusty winds from last night have
started to subside early this morning and will continue to do so
over the next few hours. Snow levels will fall between 2000 and
2500 feet this morning, bringing a few inches of snow to the
Cascade passes- where Winter Weather Advisories remain in effect.

Another frontal system will move across the region tonight into
Friday, bringing another round of lowland rain and mountain snow
to the area. Winds will increase again this evening, peak tonight,
and gradually ease through early Friday morning. Highest winds
are expected along the coast and for areas generally north of
Admiralty Inlet, where localized wind gusts to 35 to 45 mph will
be possible. Conditions continue to trend wetter with this system
when compared to this morning`s system, with current guidance
showing areas across the interior lowlands generally expected to
receive between 0.5 and 1 inch of rain. Areas along the coast will
receive a bit more, likely between 1-2 inches. Snow levels will
briefly climb towards 3500 to 4000 feet tonight, before falling
back down towards 2500 to 3000 feet by Friday evening. Additional
rounds of snow are likely for the mountains, with higher chances
of the Cascades reaching winter advisory amounts. Higher passes,
like Stevens, will likely see amounts closer to warning criteria,
between 12-20 inches, through Saturday morning. Precipitation
will become more showery by Friday afternoon, with a convergence
zone likely developing across the central Sound Friday evening.

Showers will then gradually taper on Saturday morning and become
more confined to the mountains as a weak upper level ridge starts
to build in overhead.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Model guidance continues
to highlight an upper level ridge building across the West Coast
late in the weekend and into early next week. With weak ridging in
place on Sunday, western Washington still looks to be susceptible
to incoming moisture from an atmospheric river taking aim at the
region. With a large spread remaining in QPF scenarios over the
weekend, will need to keep an eye on how guidance trends on this.
A warming airmass would allow for snow levels to rise to
5000-7500 feet across Washington by Sunday and would promote rain
falling on snow, likely elevating the potential for flooding into
early next week.

The ridge then looks to amplify over the Pacific Northwest
on Tuesday and into Wednesday, which would help direct the swath
of incoming moisture further to the north and promote drier
conditions for western Washington. Temperatures also look to climb
to above normal during this period, with afternoon highs looking
to climb into the 60s- with a few spots potentially approaching 70
across the interior. Model guidance then shows the ridge pushing
inland by Wednesday evening, which would allow for the next system
to make its way into the region. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A shortwave trough has pushed a cold frontal system
through the region this morning. An additional cold front is
expected later today into Friday. The flow aloft will remain west to
northwest. Radar remains active this morning with a line of
convective showers moving inland. The threat for any thunder remains
along the coast and over the Pacific Ocean with activity today.
Gusty winds from yesterday`s front have been decreasing down to
around 10 kt from the south (terminals close to to the waters will
continue to see gusts of 20-25 kt in between fronts). The second
front will bring more scattered showers to the region later today
into Friday morning. Widespread breezy south winds of 25 to 30 kt
are expected Thursday evening into Friday morning. WIth this being a
cold front (and with some stronger winds aloft), some wind shear
cannot be ruled out later today. Ceilings will remain borderline
MVFR/VFR this morning, but will solidify to MVFR going into Thursday
afternoon. Any heavy shower that impacts a terminal may bring
visibilities down to 2-3 mi.

KSEA...A line of rain showers to the west will impact the terminal
early this morning. A second round of rain will move through
Thursday afternoon. Ceilings will remain generally VFR until the
first round of rain passes (expect a drop to MVFR this afternoon).
Few wind gusts out of the southwest to 20 kt will be possible
through the morning. Further increases of gusts to 25-30 kt are
expected this evening as the front moves through, lasting up through
Friday morning.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong cold front has pushed through the region this
morning, with a second front still a ways offshore off the coast of
Victoria. Showers will be widespread today, with a slight chance for
thunder off the coastal waters today. As the second front approaches
the region, winds will pick up once again Thursday afternoon through
Friday morning. The sustained winds are expected to remain in the 15
to 25 kt or 20 to 30 kt range for areas under a small craft advisory
for winds. There remains a slight chance that gusts may approach
gale in isolated portions of the East Strait of Juan de Fuca and
Northern Inland Waters. While the central section of the strait was
not included in the latest headlines for later today, wind gusts on
the side closest to the west entrance may exceed 20 kt. In addition
to winds, seas of 10 to 14 feet will continue in the coastal waters
and Grays Harbor through at least Friday, before dropping down to 8
to 10 feet.

Additional systems will impact the region this weekend into early
next week. There will be another chance of gusty winds Saturday into
Sunday, and Wednesday into Thursday. The seas will remain remain
above 10 feet (especially the outer waters) through the weekend.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Several rounds of precipitation this week will bring
rises to area rivers. There is increasing potential for flooding
on the Skokomish River in Mason County later this week. With
roughly 2.5 inches of additional precipitation looking to fall
within the basin, it`s possible the Skokomish will crest near
flood stage on Friday before receding later in the day. However,
chances are higher that the river will go into flood stage late
into the weekend an atmospheric river with abundant precipitation
and significantly higher snow levels possibly moves into the region.
Ensemble guidance continues to show a large range of solutions
for precipitation amounts Sunday and Monday so confidence in this
scenario remains low at this time.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
