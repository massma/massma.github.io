Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
333 PM EDT Sun Jun 2 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure slides south of the area as a weak disturbance moves
through tonight and into the beginning of Monday. High pressure then
builds back across the area Monday night, lingering through mid-
week before heading out into the Atlantic for the latter half of the
week. A series of frontal system then approaches from the west
Thursday through next weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM MONDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Clouds will be on the increase into this evening as a mid-level
disturbance moves into the area from the west. This mid-level
shortwave becomes less defined and weakens as it approaches the
area. Any showers that are associated with it will weaken or
dissipate as they approach from the west this evening and into the
first half of tonight. The combination of showers falling out of a
mid-level cloud deck with low level dry air from the departing high
as well as the weakening forcing should allow for not much more than
cloud cover tonight. The best chance for a stray or passing shower
is for areas to the southwest, mainly near the NYC metro.

Lows tonight will be warm, generally in the low to middle 60s,
though the city will likely remain in the upper 60s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM MONDAY MORNING THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The shortwave passes overhead with a weak mid-level trough remaining
over the area on Monday. With skies becoming clearer on Monday with
the departing shortwave, temperatures will once again rise into the
low to middle 80s for much of the area. Winds will remain light out
of the west, gradually shifting to the southwest and south with
seabreeze enhancement into the afternoon. Some CAMs are indicating
some instability developing into the afternoon, primarily for areas
away from the immediate coastline. This may provide for some stray
convective showers or thunderstorms for inland areas, so kept a
slight chance for this potential, though it is fairly dependent on a
combination of clearing skies and thus more ample daytime
heating and a slightly moister BL.

Any shower or storm weakens by evening as the mid-level heights
begin to recover and ridge a bit more. This allows a surface
high pressure to build back into the region from Southeast
Canada Monday night and into Tuesday. Lows Monday night will be
in the middle 50s to low 60s, a bit cooler than previous nights.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>*Key Points*

*Seasonable temperatures through the end of the week becoming
slightly below by the weekend.

*Dry conditions expected Tuesday and Wednesday followed by wet
weather for week`s end and through next weekend.

There has been not much change in the forecast thinking for this
update; have stuck close to the NBM with local adjustments.

Global ensembles are in generally good agreement with the synoptic
pattern through next weekend though some timing and magnitude
differences exist. Ridging aloft continues to shift east on Tuesday
and Wednesday as the ridge axis passes east of the area.
The ridge then flattens to a more zonal flow by Thursday and Friday.
This is the result of a sprawling upper low taking shape over the
central Canadian Maritimes, of Pacific origin, that will head
southeast into Friday and settles over eastern Canada (EC) or over
the northeast (GFS and CMC) by the weekend. Regardless, this will
return us to a somewhat cooler and wetter pattern toward the end of
the long term period.

At the surface, high pressure centered over New England on Tuesday
shifts offshore by Wednesday. Interior sections will be warmest for
these two days under dry conditions with east/southeast flow keeping
coastal areas a few degrees cooler. Highs in the upper 70s to near
80, with low 70s for the coast each day.

By Thursday, a surface low north of Great Lakes, associated with the
aforementioned upper low heads slowly east. An associated warm front
approaches the area on Thursday and remains over, or just north of
the area. Shower chances ramp up on Thursday morning and moreso by
Thursday afternoon with the front in the vicinity. Have maintained
thunder in the forecast as model soundings continue to show some
elevated instability/CAPE Thursday afternoon into evening, which
seems reasonable in the warm sector should some clearing occur
during the day. However, the bulk of the precipitation looks to fall
after 00Z Friday which should limit the convective potential
somewhat. Deep southerly flow ahead of this frontal system will
increase available moisture...see the Hydrology section below for
additional details.

The main cold front pushes through the area as the surface low heads
east by Friday. Given that the large upper low remains to the north
with the local area under deep cyclonic flow, another frontal system
quickly follows Friday into Saturday with additional showers and
thunder possible.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /19Z SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure gradually moves farther out into the Atlantic through
this evening, with a weakening disturbance moving through late
tonight and early Monday morning. Weak high pressure builds from the
N and NE late Monday.

VFR and predominantly dry conditions are expected through the TAF
period. The possible exception would be for 06z Mon until 15z Mon
with -SHRA, but with VFR ceilings and visibilities expected.

A general S-SW flow at 7-15 kt for this afternoon with sea breeze
enhancement for some coastal terminals along with some gusts for
KJFK, and possibly KEWR. Some terminals will have wind speeds of 5
kts or less and variable direction late tonight, otherwise light W
to N winds into Monday morning with sea breeze development likely
towards or just after midday for coastal terminals.

     NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Some gusts 15-20 kt possible late this afternoon, especially at
KJFK. KEWR could briefly get a sea breeze with more of a SE wind
late this afternoon.

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...

Monday afternoon: Mainly VFR. Possible shower or thunderstorm near
and N/W of NYC terminals for the afternoon into early evening with
brief MVFR possible.

Tuesday: VFR.

Wednesday: Mainly VFR during the day. MVFR or lower possible
late day into the night with chances of showers and thunderstorms.

Thursday: MVFR or lower possible in rain showers, possible
thunderstorms afternoon into night.

Friday: MVFR possible at times in showers and thunderstorms.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Conditions will remain below SCA levels through mid week, with
seas on the ocean generally 3 ft or less. The ocean waters may
begin to approach SCA conditions with 4-5 ft waves Thursday
afternoon into Friday under enhanced southerly flow.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Isolated heavy rain with any showers or thunderstorms Thursday into
Friday is possible. PWATS could reach 1.75-2 inches Thursday into
Thursday night which is above the 90th percentile and nearing the
daily max for the date, per SPC sounding climatology for OKX. WPC
has placed much of the area into a MRGL risk of excessive rainfall
on Thursday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
With the approach of a new moon this week, astronomical levels will
be on the rise. With winds becoming more southerly and eventually
southeasterly, this will allow for increasing surge this week. As a
result, some locations could get some minor coastal flooding,
potentially becoming more widespread Tuesday night and Wednesday
night.

Tide levels increase getting closer to midweek. Stevens guidance
shows minor flood benchmarks being approached as early as Monday
night. Thus, trends will need to be monitored in subsequent
cycles as minor coastal flooding will become more likely for
the south shore bays of Nassau, Queens, and Brooklyn, along with
Western LI Sound for CT, and Westchester towards Tuesday.

Water temperatures remain around 60 degrees around the region.
This poses the threat for hypothermia to anyone immersed in the
water. Small boats, canoes, and kayaks should plan accordingly
if recreating this and use extreme caution to avoid this threat.

There is a low rip current risk through Monday due to low seas
on the ocean and winds mainly 10 kt or less.
