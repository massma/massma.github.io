Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
250 AM PDT Tue May 27 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper ridge will build across the Pacific
Northwest through Wednesday for dry, warmer weather. A frontal
system will move through on Thursday for cooler temperatures and
a chance for showers. Warmer, dry conditions return late in the
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High clouds early this
morning across Western Washington with current temps generally
in the 40s to low 50s. Patchy fog cannot be ruled out this
morning, mainly around Chehalis and along the Chehalis River
valley, but any fog development is expected to be localized.
An upper ridge will build across the Pacific Northwest today,
resulting in dry conditions, and warming temperatures. Highs
today will range in the 70s for the interior, with upper 60s
near the water. The upper ridge axis will then build further
into the interior Northwest on Wednesday, with light offshore
flow Tuesday night. Temperatures on Wednesday will be the
warmest of the season so far for interior areas, with highs in
the 80s mainly Puget Sound eastwards. A few low 90s are possible
as well in the Cascade Valleys. This will correspond to
Moderate (Orange) HeatRisk for interior areas. In addition, the
water remains rather cool, so continue to be mindful if heading
out on the water. Temperatures along the coast will be cooler
due to continued onshore flow.

A frontal system will then move towards Western Washington late
Wednesday, increasing onshore flow rapidly, allowing for cooling
temperatures into Thursday. In addition, the frontal system will
bring widespread QPF on Thursday, mainly ranging 0.05-0.25" for
the lowland areas, and locally higher amounts along the coast.
Temperatures on Thursday will be 15 to 20 degrees cooler for the
interior, with highs in the 60s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Precipitation will
quickly taper off later Thursday as an upper ridge once again
builds into the Pacific Northwest. Dry conditions, with warming
temperatures, will return Friday into the majority of Saturday
with the ridge in place across the Western US. Ensembles suggest
SW flow aloft increases Saturday into Sunday as another weak
frontal system may move across Western Washington during this
period. Although POPs are fairly minimal at this time in the NBM
(peaking around 30% in the Cascades), with the main impact being
another round of increasing onshore flow and cooler
temperatures. Uncertainty increases further by Monday, although
ensembles hint at troughing diving southwards across the Pacific
Northwest. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge building east of the Cascades
through Wednesday with Western Washington on backside of the
ridge. Southwesterly flow aloft. Light flow in the lower level
becoming offshore tonight. Flow turning back onshore Wednesday.

Variable high clouds into Wednesday morning. Patchy fog with
visibility 3-5sm possible Southwest Interior to Central coast
13z-15z. MVFR ceilings near Port Angeles until 14z. Felton

KSEA...Variable high clouds. Light wind becoming north northwest 4
to 8 knots around 18z. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the waters today. A thermally induced
surface trough will move up the coastline tonight then shift
inland Wednesday. A front will move through the area Wednesday
night into Thursday. High pressure will rebuild Thursday night and
Friday. Weak front approaching the waters Saturday.

Gale watch has been issued for the Central and Eastern Strait of
Juan de Fuca for Wednesday afternoon and evening. Westerly winds
will rapidly increase Wednesday afternoon. Small craft advisory
westerlies likely in the Central and Eastern Strait Thursday
evening and again Saturday evening. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
