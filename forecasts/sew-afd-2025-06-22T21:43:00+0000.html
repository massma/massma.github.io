Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
243 PM PDT Sun Jun 22 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridging is building behind the low
pressure system moving east, keeping warmer and drier conditions
in the forecast through the middle of the week. Expect light rain
showers and cooler temperatures through the end of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Western Washington is
seeing some breaks in the clouds this afternoon, but are unlikely
to scatter completely into the evening hours. Another round of
stratus clouds will arrive to start the day on Monday, eventually
breaking out for a high temperature in the mid to upper 70s as the
ridge moves closer to the coast. Temperatures on Tuesday have
backed off slightly, likely due to more onshore flow, but a day
in the upper 70s and even 80 in the valleys is likely.

A weak frontal system will drop in from the north on Wednesday,
introducing PoPs to the coast and north interior, spreading
showers south and east into late Wednesday night. Very light
rainfall, on the order of a few hundredths of an inch, are
possible across much of the area into Thursday. Temperatures will
cool down the upper 60s.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Another few shortwave
systems progress through the region Thursday into Friday for
isolated shower activity. By Friday afternoon, any lingering
activity should be confined to the central and northern Cascades.

By the weekend, what looks like a developing Four Corners high
pressure system could begin to take shape, and as it amplifies,
contributes to warming over the PNW. Highs on Saturday climb into
the mid 70s, and again on Sunday into the low 80s. As with all
possibilities with significant lead time, exact details will
continue to evolve.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northerly flow aloft continues as upper troughing
moves eastward with weak ridging offshore. Mostly VFR/MVFR across
the terminals this afternoon as conditions gradually begin to dry
out. Conditions will continue to improve throughout the evening,
likely rebounding to VFR after 00z. With onshore flow increasing
tonight, stratus will spread inland towards the interior for
another round of MVFR conditions, even potentially some localized
IFR conditions as well. S/SW winds throughout this evening
remaining around 4 to 8 knots.

KSEA...VFR/MVFR conditions early this afternoon will settle into
VFR by 00z. W/SW winds around 5 to 10 knots this afternoon,
decreasing to 3 to 6 knots overnight and into Monday morning.
Marine stratus will spread inland overnight, likely reaching the
terminal by 13z-16z, with a 30% chance of MVFR conditions through
the early morning. Stratus will scatter out and rebound to VFR by
the afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure will continue to build offshore
into Monday, with periodically increasing onshore flow across the
area waters, especially down the Strait of Juan De Fuca. A Small
Craft Advisory remains in effect for the Central Entrance of the
Strait of Juan De Fuca for wind gusts up to 20 to 25 kts. Westerly
winds will be elevated for the East Entrance as well, but at this
time look to be below small craft advisory criteria. Onshore flow
will continue throughout majority of the week, with the next
possible strong push down the Strait occuring on Tuesday evening.

Coastal seas 4 to 6 will remain into the end of the week.
