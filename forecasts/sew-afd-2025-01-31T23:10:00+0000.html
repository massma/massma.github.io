Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
310 PM PST Fri Jan 31 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front will continue to produce widespread areas
of precipitation this afternoon into tonight. Some snow will mix
in after dark in most lowland areas. Gusty southwest winds will
also continue through tonight. An upper level low will remain
over the area through next week, cooling temperatures, and
increasing the likelihood of seeing snow showers over much of
Western Washington this weekend into next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Key messages through the
weekend/next week:

 - This afternoon (Friday) into Saturday morning: Widespread
   precipitation will continue across all of Western Washington
   this afternoon into tonight. Precipitation will be heaviest in
   the Cascades and Olympics/Washington Coast. Cool temperatures
   tonight in the lowlands will result in some snow mixing in with
   the rain. Best chance for sticking snow are in rural areas
   under a winter weather advisory tonight/Saturday.

 - Saturday night into Monday morning: Cooler temperatures will
   increase the probability for accumulating snow in lowland areas
   Saturday night into Monday morning. While moisture will be more
   limited (due to cooler air settling in from Canada/Fraser
   Outflow), there is still a wide range of potential outcomes
   with snow accumulations across the region (and uncertainties at
   this time in the forecast). However melting/refreezing of
   surfaces may make the Monday morning commute slick.

 - Monday into next work week: Cooler air will remain settled over
   the region, which may impact vulnerable populations outdoors
   without adequate access to heating.

Synopsis: Satellite/surface analysis shows a cold front still
offshore, with low pressure centered nearby Neah Bay. Radar shows
bands of precipitation continuing this afternoon over much of
Western Washington. There is a slight chance of thunder along and
off the coast later this evening into tonight (as cold air aloft
makes the air more unstable). Gusty winds this afternoon out of
the southwest will continue through this evening ahead of the cold
front, with gusts peaking around 30-35 mph. The windiest area
remains Admiralty Inlet/Whidbey Island area with gusts to 50 mph
(wind advisory will continue).

Hi-resolution guidance has the rain bands breaking down into areas
of showers tonight into Saturday. Plenty of lows tonight will drop
below freezing (except in the Tacoma/Seattle/Everett corridor and
areas closest to the water). There`s evidence of cold air aloft
working its way towards the surface (with temperatures at -5C and
below tracking towards our area with the low at 850 mb). HREF and
multiple model members show convective showers (including a
convergence zone in Eastern Snohomish/King Counties) continuing
tonight into Saturday morning.

Diurnally, the below freezing temperatures tonight and the
potential for steady precipitation cooling the surrounding air has
increased the risk of sticking snow tonight. For these reasons, a
winter weather advisory was issued for the coast/West Strait of
Juan de Fuca, South interior, East Puget Sound Lowlands, and
Western Whatcom/Skagit Counties from 10 PM tonight until 10 PM
Saturday. The most likely outcome for these areas is for spotty
accumulations of a slushy 1-3 inches. Some areas may receive more
snow than others, and some spots may not see snow stick at all.
Heavy snow will continue to fall in the Cascades through Saturday
(the winter storm warning will continue) - with additional
accumulations of 10-20 inches expected at elevations above 3,000
ft (slopes below 3,000 ft will see up to 10 in).

Saturday night into Monday: The upper level low/trough remains
centered over Northwest Washington, with a vorticity max just
offshore. This will drive in some unusually cold air into the
region early next week (as indicated by the EFI showing a -0.9
anomaly to normal temperatures for early February). Besides some
Fraser outflow driving temperatures down to the north, there`s
good evidence of cold Pacific air moving onshore (which normally
is warmer and kills a lot of the lowland snow potential here
typically). While moisture/QPF will be more limited with the
northwest flow, any precipitation that does fall will likely be in
snow shower form. High temperatures will likely only climb into
the upper 30s Sunday in the lowlands, with lows down in the upper
20s. Snow levels will be down to near the surface during the day.

Confidence is still pretty low for exact snow accumulations. Right
now probabilities are still very high (greater than 80% for all
lowland areas) for 1" of snow or more (this drops to above 50%
for 2" of snow or more). The confidence for greater than 4" of
snow or greater are highest for Western Whatcom, and the Pacific
Coast (greater than 70%). Will leave the winter storm watches in
place for the Saturday night/Monday timeframe, but these will be
upgraded to advisories/warnings later as confidence increases (and
as more hi-res guidance comes in). Additionally, some
melting/refreezing may create slick roadways for the Monday
morning commute too.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Ensembles are in good
agreement that cold air will remain in place through the week (via
upper level troughing). Temperatures will continue to drop
(assuming fresh snow adds some albedo reflectivity to any sunlight
that is able to make it through the cloud coverage expected). The
low will keep a chance of snow showers in the forecast (but again
no frontal systems are expected to materialize at this time). Cold
temperatures will be the primary concern, with lows in the teens
and 20s most days next week. This will likely require cold weather
headlines next week if the cold forecast holds.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system will push inland tonight with strong
onshore flow following. Expect gusty W/SW winds to 20-30 kt
through 06z. Ceilings mainly MVFR range in rain with a slight
chance of thunderstorms along the coast. The air mass is cool and
slightly unstable on Saturday with snow levels near the surface. A
rain/snow mix is possible across the lowlands in passing showers.

KSEA...Low-end VFR to MVFR ceilings tonight with rain. Gusty S/SW
winds to 20 kt through 06z. Showers in the vicinity Saturday
afternoon although the central sound is mainly rain shadowed. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Strong onshore push tonight with gales through the
central/east strait of Juan de Fuca. There`s a slight chance of
thunderstorms over the Coastal Waters. Seas around 10 to 12 feet
through the weekend. There`s potential for gusty N/NE Fraser
River outflow winds Sunday through Wednesday, impacting the
Northern Inland Waters and Strait of Juan de Fuca. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
