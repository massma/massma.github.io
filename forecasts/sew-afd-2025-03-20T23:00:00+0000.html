Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
400 PM PDT Thu Mar 20 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Another system will move into the region tonight into
Friday and will bring the next round of lowland rain, mountain
snow, and breezy winds to the area. The pattern looks to remain
active through the weekend, with several additional disturbances
crossing the region. An atmospheric river will then likely reach
the area for the start of next week, before a mild and drier
pattern around Tuesday. Yet another system arrives Wednesday
night.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The next weather system
continues to move into the area this afternoon with widespread
rain spreading across the Olympic Peninsula and into the Puget
Sound region. Expect gusty winds to peak late this evening or
overnight, before easing early Friday. The strongest winds with
gusts around 40 mph are expected along the coast and near the
water from around the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca northward.
Snow levels will briefly rise to around 3500 feet, before lowering
again through the day on Friday. With this pattern, have elected
to continue the winter storm warning for Stevens Pass northward
and a winter weather advisory for Snoqualmie Pass southward.
Expect around 1-2 feet of snow through Saturday across the north
and up to around a foot for the south (with slightly lower amounts
at Snoqualmie Pass due to periods of rain due to the snow levels
rising as mentioned above). With the system moving east, expect a
transition to showers across much of the area on Friday afternoon.
An isolated thunderstorm is possible in the strongest showers,
with around a 15% chance of development. A convergence zone is
also likely to develop Friday evening and provide the focus for
additional steadier lowland rain and mountain snow. A weak upper
ridge begins to build on Saturday with the lingering showers being
increasingly confined to the mountains. Not much change in the
temperatures for the lowlands through the next couple of days with
daytime highs in the 50s and overnight lows around 40.

As the ridge builds over the western U.S. into Sunday, there
remains some notable spread in the ensemble guidance for the
placement of a moderately strong atmospheric river. Latest cluster
analysis continues to suggest this plume of moisture will impact
the region at some point Sunday. That said, there is a large
spread in the likely rainfall amounts and this will be a factor
in the potential for any river flooding. See the hydrology section
for more details. With the very warm air mass moving into the
area, expect to see snow levels quickly climb above 7000 ft by
late Sunday and closer to 8000 ft into Monday.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Expect high snow levels and
lingering showers into Monday morning, but the ridge of high
pressure builds further into the region. This will effectively cut
off the influx of moisture into the region but also continue to
support a warming trend. Temperatures likely to reach well above
normal Tuesday and into Wednesday, with daytime highs Tuesday
climbing well into the 60s across the interior. The warmest spots
in the lowlands of Lewis County may even reach 70. Mild conditions
continue into Wednesday but with increasing clouds and the return
of rain by late in the day as the next frontal system pushes
through and ushers in a return to cooler temperatures.  12<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The next frontal system is currently arriving as a warm
front spreads widespread rain into W WA. Breezy south winds of 25 to
30 kt are expected this evening into Friday morning. Gusts up to 40
kt are possible for terminals such as KBLI. Some wind shear can`t be
ruled out this evening. A mix of VFR/MVFR conditions being observed
with the trend continuing overnight and into Friday. Winds are
favored to decrease on Friday but localized gusts are possible.
Mostly VFR expected into Friday afternoon.

KSEA...Rain in the forecast for the airfield this evening with
possible reductions in visibility. Ceilings will remain generally
between VFR and MVFR this evening before trending more MVFR late
overnight into Friday morning. Winds gusts to 25-30 kt are expected
this evening as the front moves through, lasting up through Friday
morning. VFR is slated to return by Friday afternoon as wind gusts
decrease.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Several rounds of precipitation this week through
early next week will bring rises to area rivers. There is
still some potential for flooding on the Skokomish River in Mason
County later this weekend, with abundant precipitation possibly
moving into the region with significantly higher snow levels.
Ensemble guidance continues to show a large range of solutions
for precipitation amounts Sunday and Monday so confidence in this
scenario remains low at this time.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
