Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
242 PM PST Sun Dec 8 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showers will continue to taper off today as a trough
exits western Washington. Mostly dry and cool conditions will
start off the week as high pressure builds overhead. Unsettled
weather will return mid-week and beyond as troughing brings
additional chances of precipitation.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showers will continue to
pivot southeastward throughout the afternoon and evening today as
the upper level trough exits western Washington and high pressure
builds inland. Conditions will dry out on Monday, with northerly
flow allowing for temperatures to cool off a few degrees. The
lowlands will see highs in the mid 40s alongside some afternoon
sun breaks, with slightly warmer temperatures along the coast and
Cascade foothills. Temperatures will cool even further heading
into Monday night as northerly flow aloft amplifies, bringing low
temperatures Tuesday morning near or below the freezing mark for
most areas.

High resolution forecast models are picking up on the potential
for very light shower and virga activity on Tuesday along the
periphery of the high pressure ridge that will continue to amplify
along the Pacific coast mid-week. This will likely produce little
more than a few sprinkles across western Washington in any
showers that develop. Otherwise, Tuesday will provide a cloudy
and mostly dry day with continued below-normal temperatures.

The upper trough axis will shift inland on Wednesday, which may
once again stir up light shower activity across western Washington
ahead of the next incoming system. Operational models continue to
lessen the chance for measurable precipitation during the day
Wednesday, which may result in another round of sprinkles and
virga showers.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...A shortwave trough is on
track to pass over the region on Thursday, bringing in another
round of widespread lowland rain and mountain snow. With snow
levels between 3000-4000 ft, the higher mountain passes will
likely see light snow accumulations. Shower activity is favored to
continue over higher terrain into Friday as the lowlands dry out,
with up to a tenth of an inch of rainfall for the lowlands and up
to half an inch of liquid currently forecast over the mountains.

Ensembles continue to highlight potential for a more potent storm
system entering the region next weekend, though uncertainty
remains over the exact track and intensity of this system. A
chance of precipitation is maintained in the forecast through
next weekend with near-normal temperatures and breezy winds.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough will shift east of the Cascades
this evening and an upper ridge will begin to build into the region
for north to northwesterly flow aloft. Light surface flow will
turn northerly on Monday as surface high pressure builds over the
southern interior of British Columbia.

A mix of VFR and MVFR ceilings with diminishing shower
activity this afternoon and evening will lower to MVFR with
pockets of IFR overnight into Monday morning. Ceilings will lift
back to VFR Monday afternoon.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings this afternoon briefly improve to low
end VFR around 00Z, but will promptly lower back to 020-030 by 06Z.
Moist lower levels and lighter surface flow will be favorable for
some stratus to form overnight for ceilings in the IFR range 12Z-17Z
Monday morning. A gradual lifting and eventual scattering is
expected for Monday afternoon and evening. Surface winds
southerly 4 to 8 knots will become light and variable overnight then
shift to northerly less than 7 knots Monday afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure will rebuild across the
waters today tonight. The ridge will remain over the waters into
Wednesday. Another front will reach the area late Wednesday into
Thursday. Small craft advisories remain up through tonight for the
coastal waters and the west entrance to the strait for seas of 10 to
15 feet. These will subside Monday morning to less than 10 feet.
Seas build back over 10 feet with the next front expected around
midweek.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Incoming precipitation during the latter half of the
week will likely cause rises to area rivers, but is not expected
to cause any river flooding at this time.
