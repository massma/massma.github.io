.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper ridge will remain over the east Pacific
through the week with generally dry conditions and near to
slightly above normal temperatures. Temperatures are expected to
trend warmer for the weekend as the upper ridge moves onshore.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The upper level ridge
located over the easter Pacific will remain largely in place
through midweek, with dry and seasonal conditions overnight.
Temperatures Tuesday look to be a few degrees warmer, but
generally very much like today. A weak disturbance sliding down
the back side of the upstream ridge will brush the area
Wednesday boosting onshore flow and likely resulting in more
widespread stratus Wednesday morning and some chance of coastal
drizzle. Temperatures will trend cooler on Wednesday, in the
60s to low 70s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The upstream ridge will
will linger through late week, resulting in continued dry
conditions. Another weak disturbance will brush the area
Friday, increasing onshore flow again with more stratus and
cooler high temperatures. The grand ensembles continue to
highlight the upper level ridge shifting onshore over the
weekend, reinforcing the idea of temperatures trending warmer
Saturday and Sunday. The NBM highlighting 80-85% chance of
temperatures at or above 80 degrees for much of the interior
lowlands from King County southward Sunday. Overnight lows look
to remain near normal with temps cooling into the 50s overnight.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
