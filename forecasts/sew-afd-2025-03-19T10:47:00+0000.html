Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Next front moving across the region late tonight into
Thursday morning with rain, mountain snow, and locally gusty
winds. The pattern remains active with additional disturbances
arriving early Friday and over the weekend. Possible atmospheric
river setting up Sunday into Monday. Upper level ridge building Tuesday
with a chance for record highs.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
cloudy skies over Western Washington early this morning. Doppler
radar indicating light rain along the coast and light rain or snow in
the Olympics. Temperatures with the cloud cover were in the upper
30s to mid 40s at 3 am/10z.

Next front sitting offshore this morning near 135W. Extensive
cloud shield out ahead of the front already over the area. Deep
trough behind the front still digging south. In addition a wave
has developed on the backside of the front near 45N/135W. Both
these variables will make eastward progress of the front today
very slow. Doppler radar not only picking up light rain along the
coast but also offshore. The area of rain has not consolidated
yet. With the slow eastward movement rain holding off over the
interior until later this afternoon. Rain at times for the coast.
Even with the cloud cover with Western Washington in the warm
sector highs will rise into the lower to mid 50s for the interior.
A little cooler on the coast with thicker cloud cover the more
precipitation, near 50.

Jet stream aimed at Northern California will drive the southern
portion of the front inland this evening while the northern
portion off the coast lags behind. This splitting of the front
will reduce precipitation amounts over the area even though rain
expected most of the time overnight. Winds picking up over the
Northwest Interior with gusts around 40 mph. Snow levels near 3000
feet for snow in all the passes with the possible exception of
Snoqualmie Pass. Lows mostly in the lower 40s.

Front moving through Western Washington early Thursday morning.
Slight chance of convection right with the front in Grays Harbor
county. Jet consolidates behind the front and lifts north. This
will push the next system quickly across the Eastern Pacific
towards Western Washington. Rain out ahead of the front arriving
along the coast in the afternoon. Highs near 50.

Front approaching the coast by early Friday morning with another
round of rain for the lowlands and snow in the mountains Thursday
night. Snow levels remaining around 3000 feet. Lows in the lower
to mid 40s.

Front moving through Western Washington Friday. Decent orographics
behind the front keeping snow going in the mountains. Snow levels
remaining near 3000 feet.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Models in good agreement
with a little break in the action Friday night into Saturday as a
temporary upper level ridge moves through the area.
Inconsistencies in the models starting Saturday night into Sunday.
Models still having trouble with one, are we going an weak
atmospheric river event and two where will the river will set up.
The operational runs have flip flopped in the last 24 hours with
the GFS putting the river over Western Washington Sunday while
the operational ECMWF has most of the moisture going into
Vancouver Island and Southern British Columbia. Both sets of
ensembles are wet Sunday with the GFS ensembles not indicating
atmospheric river rainfall amounts. The ECMWF still has a few
atmospheric river solutions but the numbers have decreased in the
last couple of model runs. This uncertainty makes for low
confidence in the river forecasts this weekend into Monday.
Forecast wise still categorical pops Sunday with decreasing pops
into Monday.

There is increasing agreement in at least a temporary upper level
ridge pushing the river northward Tuesday with a mild air mass
over Western Washington. Record high temperatures are possible (
record for Seattle 64 degrees set in 1969 ) and even the first 70
degree day of the year can`t be totally ruled out from about
Seattle southward ( 30 percent chance highs near 70 on GFS
ensembles, 10 percent chance on ECMWF ). Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A ridge (now east of the Cascades this morning) will
give way to a trough rapidly approaching the coast. This will turn
the flow southwesterly aloft for most of Wednesday. A surface cold
front has triggered showers this morning along the coast, reaching
inland as far as KOLM. Brief visibility reductions down to 3 miles
have been observed with showers moving in a northerly direction.
Otherwise, it`s VFR most places this morning (with a couple isolated
pockets of mist).

The first line of rain showers is expected to arrive from the
Pacific Ocean this afternoon, and break apart into segments as it
treks eastward (few satellite showers are possible inland out ahead
of this main line). The showers will be capable of reducing
visibilities down to 2-3 miles (passing over terminals). Convection
is not expected (except towards Grays Harbor and off the
coast/southwest). The rain showers will continue through Thursday.
Ceilings behind this first line of rain will drop down to MVFR
(expected generally after 00-03Z, with small pockets of IFR
possible). Breezy S/SE winds will develop late this afternoon, with
gusts peaking at 20-30 kt this evening (couple isolated higher gusts
are possible).

KSEA...VFR conditions expected through roughly 06Z Thursday. Rain
showers may arrive as early as 20Z Wednesday (main line expected to
arrive after 00Z - brief visibility reductions are possible down to
2-3 miles). Ceilings are expected to drop down to MVFR once the main
complex of showers move through tonight. Gusty S/SE winds will pick
up late this afternoon, with gusts peaking around 25 kt late this
evening. WIll remain breezy with sustained winds around 10-14 kt
going into Thursday morning.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure inland will continue to push eastward. A
cold front/trough just off the shore will produce breezy conditions
and rain showers throughout the day today. There is a a 20% chance
of thunder off the coast today (primarily towards the southwest).
Winds have begun increasing at Cape Elizabeth & Destruction Island,
and will soon reach gale-force this morning. The highest winds are
expected in the outer coastal waters (with winds gusting over 40 kt
are possible). The threat of widespread storm-force gusts remain
low, but cannot rule out a few gusts to near 50 kt as the cold front
moves inland.

SE winds have also begun to pick up around Smith Island this
morning. The gusty winds for the inland waters are still expected to
start in this area, then quickly spread to remaining waters by this
afternoon. Sustained winds of 15-25 kt (couple areas up to 30 kt)
are expected for the small craft advisories in effect. Additionally,
there remains a 40-60% chance that areas close to Victoria
(particularly from New Dungeness up to Point Roberts) could see
gusts up to gale force. Additionally, for increasing seas of 12 to
18 feet by this afternoon, a small craft advisory was added for the
Grays Harbor bar.

The forecast remains unsettled for the remainder of the week into
the weekend. Another weaker front Thursday/Friday will bring gusty
south winds to most of the waters, and again Saturday/Sunday.
Additional headlines will likely be needed for small craft. Seas
will drop to 10 to 12 feet late Thursday. There is potential for
seas to drop below 10 feet briefly Sunday, otherwise seas will
remain around 8 to 10 feet next week.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Several rounds of precipitation this week will bring
rises on area rivers. Increasing potential for flooding on the
Skokomish River in Mason County later this week. It`s possible the
Skokomish crests near flood stage Friday before receding later in
the day. Chances are higher that the river goes over flood stage
late into the weekend or Monday as an atmospheric river with
abundant precipitation and significantly higher snow levels
possibly moves into the area. Ensemble guidance continues to show
a large range of solutions for precipitation amounts Sunday and
Monday so confidence remains low.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
