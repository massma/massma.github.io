Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
207 AM PDT Fri May 30 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will build into the region today
bringing warmer and drier conditions. A weak frontal system will
move over the region on Saturday. Weak disturbances moving over
the region will keep precipitation chances for the Cascades into
early next week. The next frontal system arrives on Thursday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Warm and dry weather returns
today with a weak ridge over the region. Highs in the interior
will reach the 70s to lower 80s this afternoon. The coast will be
cooler and in the 60s with NW flow. The ridge exits east on
Saturday while a trough moves in from the west. This trough will
bring showers to the coast during the morning, with showers
reaching the interior from late morning to afternoon. We`re under
post-frontal onshore flow Saturday night with showers mainly
focused in the interior (convergence zone) and the Cascades.
Onshore flow prevails on Sunday with weak troughing over the NW.
Showers are mainly to our north in B.C. with a weak disturbance.
Temps are close to average with highs in the mid to upper 60s. 33

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...An offshore ridge is
nearly stationary next week, keeping WA under N/NW flow. The
forecast is mainly dry through the period with average to slightly
warmer than average temperatures. By midweek, the flow becomes
more westerly with light showers returning as a weak system rolls
in. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>VFR conditions prevail through the TAF period. Low
(10-15%) chance for some patchy fog in the river valleys/fog prone
locations this morning. Clear skies continue today, with
increasing cirrus clouds tonight. Winds light north/northeasterly
early this morning, becoming north/northwesterly after sunrise,
peaking at around 5 to 10 kt this afternoon.

KSEA...VFR conditions prevail though the TAF period. Light
northeast winds early this morning, becoming northwest 5 to 10 kt
during the day today.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Broad surface high pressure over the Pacific Northwest
is lending itself to tranquil conditions over coastal waters
today. A weak frontal system will move through Saturday morning.
Then, a strong 1036 mb high pressure system will quickly usher in
behind the front. This will allow for breezy northwesterly winds
to develop, beginning Saturday afternoon. A thermal surface trough
attempts to develop along the coast, but looks to be mostly
confined to southern Oregon into California, where the strongest
winds will be along the West Coast. These winds will persist all
the way through at least Tuesday as the high slowly retreats
westward. Wind speeds look to remain in the Small Craft Advisory
category, but gusts to low-end gale force cannot be ruled out
during this period.

As for the interior waters, a westerly push down the Strait of
Juan de Fuca is expected Saturday afternoon/evening behind the
frontal system which looks to reach Small Craft Advisory criteria.
Following, west/northwest winds will prevail into early next
week with no additional headlines expected at this time.

Seas remain 4 to 6 ft today. Seas begin to increase Saturday
afternoon up to 8 to 12 ft and will remain there through Tuesday.
Waves may reach as high as 12-14 ft in the outer coastal waters
during the periods of strongest winds. The dominant period will be
quite short, around 7 to 8 seconds, making for very choppy seas
Saturday evening through Tuesday.
