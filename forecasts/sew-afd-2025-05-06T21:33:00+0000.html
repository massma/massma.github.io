Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
233 PM PDT Tue May 6 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will remain in place today, allowing for
another dry and warm day across western Washington. A weak system
will cross the region on Wednesday, bringing in light shower
activity and cooler temperatures. Drier and mild conditions will
return through the remainder of the week, with another frontal
system on track to bring unsettled conditions over the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge axis
will continue to slide eastward today, bringing in increasing high
clouds as the next trough approaches. A thermally induced surface
trough will shift inland throughout the afternoon, resulting in
elevated temperatures across the western Washington lowlands.
Highs today will reach the upper 60s to lower 70s along the coast
and the upper 70s to low 80s further inland.

Surface flow will shift onshore this evening as a frontal system
approaches the coast. Scattered showers will spread inland
overnight and throughout the day Wednesday, producing periods of
drizzle and light showers. The weakening front will shift inland
by the late afternoon Wednesday with breezy post frontal winds and
likely Puget Sound convergence zone activity continuing into the
evening hours.

High pressure will build into western Washington from the south on
Thursday and Friday, allowing conditions to dry out under cloudy
skies. In the warm sector of an approaching trough, temperatures
will warm up and peak near the 70 degree mark for much of the
interior lowlands on Friday.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Cloud cover will increase
across western Washington on Saturday as the next trough
approaches the Pacific Northwest. Chances of rain increase along
the coast heading into Saturday evening, with the best chance for
widespread rain on Sunday as a front slides across the region. A
longwave upper trough will dig southward just offshore on Monday,
maintaining the threat of shower activity and keeping temperatures
on the cool side to start off next week. Unsettled and cooler
conditions will continue into Tuesday as troughing continues.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>VFR with light northerly winds generally 4 to 7 kt
today as high pressure remains over the region. Easterly flow is
favored to develop through the Cascade gaps today, but will not be
strong enough to reach the east Puget Sound terminals. A frontal
system will move inland overnight through the day Wednesday,
bringing in light scattered showers and elevated southwest winds
6 to 10 kt with gusts to 15 to 20 kt. Convergence zone showers are
favored to develop behind the front and linger into Wednesday
evening.

KSEA...VFR with northwest flow 5 to 8 kt this afternoon, shifting
more NE overnight and shifting SW as the frontal system
approaches. Incoming shower activity Wednesday may cause a brief
dip to MVFR conditions between 15z-18z, but confidence is low.
Showers will continue throughout the day Wednesday with potential
for convergence zone showers Wed evening.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure will shift eastward today,
maintaining benign conditions over area waters today. A weak
frontal system will slide eastward throughout the day Wednesday,
with a push of Small Craft winds through the Strait of Juan de
Fuca with the strongest winds through the central Strait. High
pressure will rebuild over the region Thursday through Saturday,
allowing for more calm conditions over area waters. The next
system is expected to cross over the region towards the end of the
weekend with unsettled conditions persisting into next Monday and
Tuesday.

Seas generally 5 to 7 feet will rise to 7 to 8 feet on Wednesday.
Seas will ease on Thursday, returning back to 5 to 6 feet through
the weekend.
