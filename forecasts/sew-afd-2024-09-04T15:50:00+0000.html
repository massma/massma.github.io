Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
850 AM PDT Wed Sep 4 2024

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Widespread stratus across Puget Sound this morning, with
some clearing already occuring in portions of central Puget Sound.
Stratus will clear further generally by 10 to 11 AM for clear
skies and sunny conditions. Temperatures will warm into the 70s
and 80s today, corresponding to Minor and areas of Moderate
HeatRisk. No major forecast updates this morning.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...A strong upper level ridge combined with weak low
level offshore flow will lead to unseasonably warm temperatures
through Friday. The ridge will weaken and shift eastward by the
weekend for a return of onshore flow and cooler temperatures.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper ridge continues to
build over the region this morning as the low level flow
transitions to weak offshore. A shallow marine layer along the
coast extends inland through the strait and Chehalis Gap and
locally into portions of Puget Sound early this morning.
Increasing subsidence with the building ridge will lead to some
locally dense fog in those areas before it quickly burns off later
this morning. High temperatures will get a nice boost today with
near 80 likely for coastal areas and mid 70s to mid 80s across the
interior lowlands. An axis of thermally induced low pressure at
the surface remains oriented near the coast into Thursday morning.
High temperatures in the 80s will be common along the immediate
coast before the sea breeze cools things down late in the
afternoon. For the interior lowlands, it will be quite warm with
widespread highs ranging from the 80s north to lower 90s across
the Southwest Interior. A number of locations look to threaten
daily high temperature records on Thursday. Upper ridging will
weaken slightly on Friday with the thermal trough shifting inland
from the coast. Coastal areas look to cool 10 to 15 degrees on
Friday, but much of the interior lowlands will remain
warm...around 10 to 15 degrees above normal for the first week of
September.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Upper ridging continues to
weaken as it gradually shifts into the Northern Rockies over the
weekend. Dry conditions will continue into Sunday as temperatures
trend downward a few degrees each day. Ensembles continue their
previous trends of anomalous upper troughing developing offshore
early next week. A couple of dissipating fronts may manage to
produce a few showers over the Olympic Peninsula by later Monday
or Tuesday, otherwise we can expect more in the way of night and
morning cloud cover and temperatures returning to near seasonal
levels. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>LIFR/IFR Morning fog continues across much of the region
this morning due weak flow aloft (upper level ridge building well
into Canada with neutral/weak north/northeasterly flow aloft over
WA, thermal troughing underneath). As the sun lifts up, this will
lift up/burn off the fog/low cloud coverage between 15Z and 17Z. A
couple areas may see the fog/clouds linger longer (up near
KPAE/coast/Strait of Juan de Fuca through 20Z), but otherwise
clear/VFR skies are expected for the remainder of the day. Low
clouds/fog may return in a couple areas Thursday morning (best
chances are west of Puget Sound and Cascades due to light/calm
easterly winds). Winds will remain out of the north in Puget Sound 4
to 8 kt, and out of the east in the mountains 5 to 10 kt.

KSEA...LIFR low is slowly lifting up, and it will scatter out as the
sun lifts up between 15 and 17Z this morning. Once the fog/clouds
burn off, expect clear/VFR skies through the remainder of the day.
Threat of low clouds/fog is significantly lower for Thursday morning
(at this time, it is expected to remain west of Puget Sound). Winds
out of the north at 5 to 10 kt.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...A thermally induced trough will extend northward along the
coast today, allowing for flow to transition to offshore and then
persist through Thursday. The trough will move inland on Friday,
allowing for high pressure over the northeastern Pacific to build
back into the coastal waters and for flow to transition back to
onshore. During this period, northerly winds will be dominant over
the majority of waters, with periods of east winds through the
Strait of Juan de Fuca. While some of these northerlies over coastal
waters may get close to SCA criteria, by and large speeds should
remain below any headline thresholds.

Seas will generally hover between 3 to 5 feet through Wednesday for
the Coastal Waters. Seas are expected to build again, this time
reaching 5 to 8 feet Thursday and Friday and largely shorter period
and dominated by wind-driven seas.

.FIRE WEATHER...Upper level ridging and an associated surface
thermal trough will be building and moving into western Washington
Wednesday into Thursday. This will allow for temperatures to begin
to rise and the air mass will begin to dry out and become unstable.
As fuels continue to dry, these conditions will combine to create
elevated to near-critical fire weather conditions over the mountains
on Thursday. A return to onshore flow over the Olympic Peninsula
will begin to bring cooler, moist air to the Olympics, but the
Cascades remain warm, dry and unstable. A Fire Weather Watch has
been issued for all the mountain zones for Thursday, going through
Friday as well for the Cascades. A return to onshore flow on Friday
looks to bring just enough moisture to relieve the Olympic mountains
of critical fire weather conditions, while conditions remain dry and
unstable through Friday over the Cascades.

Winds will also turn easterly over the Cascades beginning late on
Wednesday. While they will not be overly strong, a period of breezy
winds is expected late Wednesday night into early Thursday morning
as air funnels through the gaps over the Cascade crest. Another
period of offshore flow is expected Thursday night into Friday, but
it looks to be less strong.

Cooler and more moist air will return area-wide through the weekend
and into the beginning of next week. LH
