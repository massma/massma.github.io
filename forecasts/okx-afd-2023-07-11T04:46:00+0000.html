Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
1246 PM EDT Mon Jul 10 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
Low pressure over the area today will move slowly northeast into
New England through tonight. Weak high pressure will then
gradually build from the south and west late tonight, move
across from Tuesday into Wednesday, then pass offshore late this
week. This will give way to the next frontal system and wave of
low pressure.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The heavy rainfall has moved out of the region, however,
scattered rain showers, and isolated thunderstorms with briefly
heavy rainfall remain possible. Widespread flooding is no loaner
expected, therefore the flood watch has been cancelled.

A weak surface low centered across southern New England into
eastern Long Island at midday will be re enforced by an
approaching mid-level shortwave that moves through the
northeast this afternoon into this evening. Additional
scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms will be possible
into this evening.

The surface low continues to track slowly north to northeast
today, and CAMs mainly showing scattered showers and
thunderstorms for the area this afternoon into this evening,
with the best chance for additional rain showers for interior
portions of Southern Connecticut.

As the low moves to the northeast weak upper ridging builds to
the west and southwest late tonight, with dry weather, and
surface high pressure approaches the area from the southwest.
Lows will be warm, generally in the upper 60s to low 70s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
Surface high pressure continues to build into the region
Tuesday and through the day on Wednesday with generally quiet
and dry conditions expected. High temperatures will see a
warming trend with highs on Tuesday in the middle to upper 80s
and highs on Wednesday a bit warmer with temperatures rising
into the upper 80s and low 90s.

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...
No significant changes to the long term.

The next wave of low pressure along with a cold front will
approach Thursday and continue into the weekend. Chances for
showers and thunderstorms return to the forecast.

Temperatures will remain at or slightly above through the long
term. The warmest two days in the long term will be Wednesday
and Thursday with forecast highs in the upper 80s to lower 90s.
Heat index values remain below heat advisory criteria.

&&

.AVIATION /15Z MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
Low pressure centered over Long Island Sound as of 14Z will move
very slowly northeast into New England. KGON still remains east
of the low, with heavy rain and LIFR conditions. These showers
are coming to an end, but one last round just ahead of the low may
move across early this afternoon, so do not expect improvement
to VFR there until evening. Elsewhere, some transitional MVFR
cigs should give way to VFR this afternoon, with NW flow right
of 310 magnetic increasing to around/just over 10 kt, with a
few gusts 15-20 kt possible.

VFR with diminishing NW winds tonight, backing more W late.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Some occasional wind gusts to near 20 kt this afternoon.

OUTLOOK FOR 12Z TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...

Tuesday and Wednesday: Mainly VFR.

Thursday and Friday. Chance of showers and thunderstorms,
mainly each afternoon/evening. MVFR or lower cond likely.
