.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Precipitation and cooler weather will continue
throughout the rest of the week. Isolated light showers possible
into tonight. A cold front on Wednesday will bring widespread
rain, chance of thunder, and snow at the higher elevations. A
stronger system will arrive Friday afternoon bringing moderate to
heavy precipitation and gusty winds.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Unsettled weather and
cooler temperatures will continue throughout the week as a series
of systems will impact the area. Currently overcast skies and
colder air behind a cold front are keeping temperatures in the
50s. Some post-frontal light showers are still possible this
afternoon into tonight.

A strong cold front will move through the area during the early
morning hours on Wednesday bringing much colder air. Rain will
begin to move into Western Washington during the early morning
hours and continue to spread inland. The colder air behind the
cold front will lead to destabilization of the atmosphere bringing
the possibility of thunderstorms (10-20%) during the
afternoon/evening hours bring the chance of heavier localized
precipitation. In addition, gusty winds are possible, with gusts
peaking to around 20 kts. The ensembles are currently hinting at a
convergence zone developing in the afternoon hours which may lead
to higher localized rain accumulations.

Rain will continue into Thursday and taper off in the evening
hours. The cold air behind the cold front will bring down the snow
levels down to 3500-4000 ft. Some locations at the higher
elevations may see up to a few inches of snow during the morning
hours. However, no significant impacts are expected. Between
Wednesday and Thursday, the highest rain accumulations will be in
the mountains, with 1-2 inches possible, while the lowlands may
see accumulations of 0.5-1 inch.

An atmospheric river will impact the area Friday afternoon through
Sunday bringing the chance for significant rainfall and gusty
winds. Models show that the strongest gusts will occur on the west
coast and along the Strait of Juan de Fuca, with gusts peaking
between 30-40 kts. There is some uncertainty on total rain
amounts but ensemble guidance shows that the locations with the
highest accumulations will be near the north coast and the
mountains.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The focus over the long
term is on a potential AR event as a narrow band of moisture
streams over the Pac NW. Winds will be breezy too. Total rainfall
amounts through the weekend show 3-6" over the north coast,
Olympics and North Cascades - certainly the wettest period of the
season so far. Rivers have been pretty flat this fall but we
should expect sharp rises and will need to watch the levels
closely. It`ll be wet down in the lowlands as well with 1-2" (with
Sunday being the wetter day from Seattle south). Precipitation
tapers off Sunday night as this band weakens and shifts south. We
may see drier weather heading toward midweek with high pressure.
Temperatures are on the mild side with highs in the 60s and lows
in the 50s. Cooler Monday night with lows in the upper 30s and
40s. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>As fall-like weather settles into the region, a
series of frontal systems will bring periods of rainfall to
western Washington throughout the week and into the weekend. There
is a signal of an atmospheric river pattern developing this
weekend that could bring in moderate to heavy rainfall at times,
though the exact timing and placement of this storm system still
remains uncertain. Precipitation amounts will continue to be
monitored closely over the next few days to determine if there is
a risk of elevated river flows. At this time, area rivers are not
currently forecast to rise into action stage or reach minor flood
stage.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft with an upper level trough
offshore through Wednesday. A weakening frontal system will move
through the area tonight into Wednesday morning, bringing another
round of rain to the region. Conditions across the area terminals
are generally MVFR to VFR this afternoon, however expect ceilings
to lower towards MVFR again overnight as the next frontal system
approaches. General improvement towards VFR conditions is expected
through the afternoon hours on Wednesday, however scattered showers
will persist through the day and may briefly bring conditions back
down to MVFR or even IFR at times. Hi-res guidance continues to
indicate a post-frontal convergence zone developing across Snohomish
county on Wednesday. There also remains a 10-20 percent chance of
isolated thunderstorms occuring during the afternoon and evening
hours on Wednesday. Winds will primarily be S/SW 4-7 kt tonight,
increasing to 8-12 kt overnight into Wednesday morning. Winds will
become variable for terminals in the vicinity of the convergence
zone.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings this afternoon with W/SW winds around 4-7
kts. Slight improvement towards VFR possible by 06Z, however
expect another round of MVFR ceilings to move into the terminal
overnight into early Wednesday. Winds will increase to 8-12 kts
Wednesday morning as the front approaches. PSCZ looks to remain
north of the terminal, however showers and a 10-20 percent chance
of thunderstorms will be possible Wednesday afternoon and evening.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure over the waters will weaken
tonight as the next frontal system moves into the region late
tonight into Wednesday morning. Weak high pressure will try and
build into the waters later on Wednesday. Another system will
move across the area waters on Thursday, before the strongest
system moves into Vancouver Island over the weekend.

The frontal systems tonight into Wednesday and on Thursday look
to weaken as they move into the area waters. The stronger system
over the weekend has the potential to produce sustained small
craft winds, with the potential for gale gusts, over the coastal
waters and northern portion of the inland waters.

Seas will continue to range between 6-8 feet through midweek,
increasing towards 8-10 ft across the outer coastal waters on
Thursday. Seas then look to subside briefly on Friday, before
increasing towards 10-12 ft over the weekend. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
