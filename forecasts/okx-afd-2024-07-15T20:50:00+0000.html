Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
450 PM EDT Mon Jul 15 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak surface trough will be in place through Tuesday as upper
level disturbances move across. A cold front will approach
from the west on Wednesday, and move through late Wednesday
night into Thursday morning. High pressure will then follow for
late week, and should remain nearby into the upcoming weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM TUESDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>First round of strong to severe tstms ongoing across
Westchester/Fairfield attm and should continue moving eastward
into S CT. These storms may weaken as they enter a more
maritime environment, but this is uncertain as high sfc
dewpoints may help fuel these storms farther east into S CT
through the late day hours. Second round of storms over N
central PA should arrive late this evening or either side of
midnight, and could also produce gusty winds. SPC severe slight
risk area clips western Orange County, and a marginal risk
continues N of NYC and for S CT.

Low temps will be near 80 in NYC, and in the 70s elsewhere. Some
patchy fog may be possible late across areas impacted by
earlier tstms.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Heat advy continues into Tue for most of the area. Temps should
be a tad warmer but dewpoints a little lower, and this should
yield heat index values similar to those of today. There is a
chance for afternoon/evening tstms as a mid level shortwave
trough moves through. SPC slight risk includes areas NW of NYC,
with a marginal risk for the rest of the CWA, as these will be
ample instability and vertical shear to support organized cells
and line segments capable of producing strong wind gusts.

Another very warm/humid night expected for Tue night, with lows
again near 80 in NYC and in the mid/upper 70s most elsewhere.

Extended heat advy into Wed for areas with fcst high temps near
or above 90 and heat index values 95 or more (most of wrn
sections of Long Island/S CT on west). Uncertainty on meeting
criteria is higher for areas to the east, where high temps will
only be in the mid/upper 80s but where dewpoints could be
higher.

Another round of strong to locally severe convection expected
for Wed afternoon and high ahead of the approaching cold front.
Front should enter the area late at night, with low temps from
the upper 60s to mid 70s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The main story for the long term will be relief from the high
heat and humidity that currently persists over the region.

Key Points:

* A cold front will continue working offshore on Thursday. A few
  showers, possibly a thunderstorm may linger nearby in the
  morning with dry conditions becoming likely in the afternoon
  and evening.

* Daytime temperatures will return to near seasonable levels
  Thursday and Friday with dew points falling into the lower and
  middle 60s, potentially upper 50s in spots.

* A slight moderating temperature trend is possible for the
  upcoming weekend, but highs will still be in the middle to
  upper 80s with dew points in the 60s.

* Mainly dry conditions should persist into the upcoming
  weekend.

Upper level trough will continue over the region on Thursday
with the cold front pushing offshore. The deep moisture axis
and main area of forcing follows, but there could be some
lingering showers in the morning, especially closer to the
coast. A thunderstorm is possible, but instability will be
diminishing as the front pushes further offshore. Model trends
continue supporting the end of any showers Thursday afternoon
and have trended PoPs lower than the latest deterministic NBM.

The upper trough axis will likely swing across the area Thursday
night into Friday morning. Broad troughing will then persist
aloft into the start of the weekend, with a more amplified
trough passage late in the weekend. The main uncertainty will be
how much moisture will be able to return to the region. Forcing
continues to look weak, but there is a signal for a weak
surface trough or front nearby which could be a mechanism for
convection. The deepest moisture and more organized forcing
stays largely north. Will continue to keep the forecast dry
through the weekend/next Monday, which is in line with the
latest model consensus.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /21Z MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak surface trough remains in the vicinity through the TAF
period.

There will be two periods where showers/thunderstorms are
possible. The first will be this afternoon until about 22z and
mainly for KHPN and KBDR. The second period will be around 02z
to 05z this evening with an approaching cluster of
showers/thunderstorms. This cluster will be weakening, but
confidence in thunder is high enough to have a TEMPO in the TAF.

Winds mostly SW/S, increasing to around 10-15kt today. Winds lower
to about 5-10kt overnight and then increase again to 10-15kt Tuesday.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Occasional gusts to 20kt possible.

Showers/thunderstorms now unlikely this afternoon. Still the
chance for showers/thunderstorms later this evening around 03z
to 05z and have converted PROB30 to a TEMPO.

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

Tuesday Afternoon: A chance of evening showers and
thunderstorms and MVFR, mainly from NYC metro on NW. SW wind
gusts 15-20 kt afternoon into early evening.

Wednesday: VFR to start. MVFR or lower in showers and
thunderstorms late afternoon into the evening, with a chance
of showers and thunderstorms late at night.

Thursday: Mainly VFR. Chance of showers and thunderstorms.

Friday and Saturday: VFR.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A period of SCA conditions is possible, mainly on the ocean,
Tuesday night into Wednesday night with increased southerly flow
ahead of an approaching cold front. Lingering 5-6 ft seas are
possible on Thursday before seas subside into the end of the
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>With a humid air mass in place, any thunderstorms that develop
through Wed night will have the potential to produce downpours
capable of causing at least minor urban and poor drainage
flooding.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>There is a moderate rip current risk on the ocean beaches into this
evening and then again on Tuesday due to 3-4 ft S swell of 6-8s
and S winds 10-15 kt. Seas increase on Wednesday to 5 ft which
supports a high rip current risk.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
