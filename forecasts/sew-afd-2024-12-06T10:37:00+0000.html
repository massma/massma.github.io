Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
237 AM PST Fri Dec 6 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong frontal system will bring widespread
precipitation into the region Friday afternoon through the
weekend, primarily in the form of rain for lower elevations, snow
above 3,500 feet. Breezy south to southwest winds are also
expected Saturday morning. Expect a break in the activity Monday
before more weather returns mid-week. Temperatures will also cool
down slightly next week, similar to temperatures seen earlier
this week with highs in the low 40s and lows in the 30s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A couple of ridges inland
across the Rockies to the southeast, and up into B.C. Canada will
break down today as a closed low/trough setup begins to move
inland over Northern B.C. late today into Wednesday. This will
drive the polar jet towards the Southwest B.C./Washington into the
weekend.

It is relatively quiet this morning with just a few showers off
of Neah Bay this morning. Most areas will see mid and high level
clouds build in throughout the morning into the afternoon. Just
off the coast underneath the upper level closed low/jet sits a
surface low pressure system, with a warm front and cold front well
off the Pacific Coast. The warm front will bring snow levels up to
between 9,000 ft and 10,000 ft by Friday evening. This will also
bring plenty of moisture into the region in the form of bands of
stratiform rain. The rain is expected to continue Friday night
into Saturday morning as the cold front kicks in. In between
fronts, there will be a brief period Friday night/early Saturday
morning of gusty south-southwest winds. Windiest areas at this
point will be the Northwest Interior lowland areas, and along the
Pacific Coast. These areas will most likely see wind gusts peak at
25 to 35 mph.

The cold front will continue precipitation into Saturday, with the
heaviest of the precipitation transitioning to the Cascades.
Another front will sneak in behind the cold front, continuing the
precipitation into Sunday (but this round will be lighter than the
rounds coming Friday night into Saturday). The snow levels will
drop to just above 3,000 ft in most areas Saturday afternoon.

24 hour QPF totals remain on track from the previous forecasts.
Lowland areas Friday night into Saturday night will see around
2/3`s of an inch to an inch (with higher amounts closer to the
mountains), Olympics/Coast and Southern Cascades seeing 1.5-2
inches, and the North Cascades seeing the most with 2-3 inches
(couple areas potentially seeing locally higher amounts with
convective banding and/or convergence zone activity behind the
fronts).

The snow will be concentrated Saturday afternoon into Sunday
afternoon (primarily in the Cascades), with a majority of
accumulations falling at or above 3,100 ft. Confidence is high
that Stevens and Snoqualmie Passes will see accumulating snow
during this time period. Probabilities remain highest in seeing
amounts in the advisory thresholds (around 6 inches at Snoqualmie
and around a foot at Stevens Pass), but probabilities are still
less than 50% for over a foot at Stevens Pass (for a warning). If
traveling through the passes this weekend, check conditions ahead
of time.

High surf is the only other concern not mentioned going into the
weekend. Seas are expected to build close to 20 feet going into
Sunday, which may produce large breaker waves and produce coastal
erosion. Otherwise the precipitation will begin to diminish going
into Sunday to finish out the weekend. The cool air will most
likely bring low temperatures back into the mid and upper 30s for
most lowland areas Sunday night into Monday.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...An upper level ridge axis
will sneak in behind the trough/cold front Monday. This will dry
out the region Monday into Tuesday with a mix of clouds and sun.
Some patchy fog will be possible these mornings. Beyond Tuesday
the forecast becomes tricky with timing of the departure of the
ridge to the east. Most of the operational and ensemble models
show precipitation returning Tuesday into Thursday, but confidence
is low at this time in any impacts or precipitation amounts. Temps
will likely remain steady, with highs in the 40s and lows in the
30s through the extended forecast.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Flow aloft northwesterly becoming more westerly then
southwesterly tonight as an upper trough approaches the area. At
the surface, a frontal system is slated to approach the area
tonight and move inland Saturday.

Widespread VFR conditions are prevalent at the area terminals this
morning. A few spots of patchy fog may develop early this morning,
but expect extent to mostly be limited to the Kitsap Peninsula
and southern interior. Mid to high cloud cover will stream into
the area today ahead of the approaching frontal system. While some
light showers will be possible in the morning and afternoon,
expect mostly VFR conditions to prevail through the day. More
widespread rain will start to push inland from northwest to
southeast this evening and through the overnight period into
Saturday. Expect a gradual lowering of ceilings through the day,
with more widespread MVFR/IFR conditions developing tonight into
Saturday morning. Southeasterly winds will persist around 5-10
kts through the afternoon. Terminals along the coast and across
the northern Sound will see gusty southeasterly winds develop by
this evening, with gusts to 20-30 kt possible at times into
Saturday.

KSEA...VFR conditions with light southeasterly winds. Expect VFR
conditions to persist through much of the day, with a gradual
lowering of ceilings as mid to high level clouds continue to
stream into the area ahead of an approaching front. May see some
light showers today, but expect more widespread rain to move in
between 09-12Z Saturday with ceilings lowering to MVFR, or even
IFR, by early Saturday morning. Winds will be southerly tonight
at 5-10 kts. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A stronger frontal system will move across the area
waters today into the weekend, bringing more widespread advisory
strength southerly winds to the coastal waters and portions of
the interior waters. Ahead of the front, strong southerly flow
will allow for waves to become steep across the coastal waters,
with seas mainly persisting at 7-9 ft with a period at 5-8
seconds. Gales will be possible across the northern zones of the
coastal waters today as the frontal system approaches. Small craft
advisories remain in effect for the interior waters, but will
need to monitor for the potential of gales for areas like
Admiralty Inlet, the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca, and Northern
Inland Waters tonight into early Saturday as the front moves
through. Winds will transition to westerly in the wake of the
front Saturday, keeping conditions breezy across the coastal
waters. A strong push of westerlies is likely along the Strait of
Juan de Fuca Saturday night into Sunday as a low pressure system
pushes into BC/WA. Seas will build towards 16-20 ft over the
coastal waters on Sunday. High pressure will build over the
coastal waters early next week for lighter winds and subsiding
seas. Another frontal system then looks to move through the area
waters midweek. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...A shift to a more active pattern will bring a much
stronger weather system across portions of Western Washington. This
will bring widespread precipitation, as well as snow levels climbing
to around 7000 to 9000 feet during the bulk of the heavier rain on
Saturday. This, combined with the heavier rainfall, will result in
rises on rivers across the region. While the precipitation forecast
continues to fluctuate a bit run-to-run, 2 to 3 inches of rainfall
appear most likely. However, high end potential amounts would reach
into the 4 to 5 inch range across portions of the Olympics and the
northern and central Cascades. As a result, a flood potential
outlook (ESF) remains in effect for Whatcom, Skagit, Snohomish, and
Mason counties. These areas see the greatest threat of river
flooding during the late Saturday and Sunday time period. Other area
rivers will continue to be monitored for flood potential. A brief
period of drier conditions will allow for rivers to recede early
next week, but another round of hydrologically significant
precipitation may follow later next week.
