Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
1007 AM PST Wed Dec 11 2024

.SYNOPSIS...High pressure through today with dry but cool
conditions. Rain chances then increase this evening through the
weekend as a series of disturbances take aim. Saturday could bring
gusty winds with an increased risk of coastal flooding, particularly
along the Pacific coast. Active weather will trend into early
next week.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The forecast remains on track
this morning. The remainder of the previous discussion follows below,
with updates made to the aviation section. 14

High pressure is persisting over the PNW currently as its axis
cuts through W WA. Conditions are mostly dry across the CWA but
mid to high-level cloud coverage has maintained, keeping low
temperatures relatively warmer than seen previously and fog at
bay. Highs will top out near average with values in the upper 40s
to near 50 F. As the day progress, PoPs will increase from west to
east as a trough enters. Most of its energy will focus towards
northern CA but showers are slated to become more prevalent this
evening and into Thursday with snow showers expected at the
passes. High temperatures will cool a couple of degrees on
Thursday with mid to upper 40s expected. Another round of 30s
overnight is in store for Thursday night.

Deterministic guidance is hinting at brief shortwave ridging
early on Friday but, it won`t be enough to keep precip completely
out of the forecast. A more organized disturbance looks to form
offshore on this day as a front enters by the evening hours with
widespread rain, mountain snow and the potential for gusty winds.
High temperatures will be similar to Thursday`s on Friday, with
values in the mid to upper 40s expected. But overnight lows will
be a touch warmer in the lower 40s as surface winds increase
mixing.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...As mentioned, a stout
disturbance will enter late Friday into Saturday. NBM
probabilities continue to indicate a 20-30 percent of wind gusts
of 40 mph or higher along the coast and for areas across the
North Interior. Winds will depend on the track of this area of
low pressure, so details will continue to be ironed out as
guidance comes into better focus. Along with wind and
precipitation, coastal flooding will need to monitored throughout
the weekend as astronomical tides peak this weekend into early
next week for coastal areas.

.MARINE...Surface high pressure over the waters will weaken
today. A splitting front will reach the area late tonight into
Thursday bringing small craft advisory winds and seas near 10 feet
to portions of the coastal waters. High pressure will briefly
rebuild Thursday night before a significantly stronger storm
system arrives Saturday. Gales possible over the coastal waters
with small craft advisory winds possible at the entrances to the
Strait of Juan de Fuca, Northern Inland waters and Admiralty
Inlet. High pressure will rebuild over the waters again Sunday.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...Next round of precipitation with a weak system
Thursday will only result in small rises on the rivers. A stronger
storm will set up along the coast over the weekend with the
potential to bring more significant precipitation to the region.
While area rivers will rise only the Skokomish River is currently
forecast to potentially reach minor flood stage Saturday. Another
round of precipitation early next week could push the Skokomish
river above flood stage. Felton
