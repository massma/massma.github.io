Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cloudy skies and light showers will persist throughout
the day as an upper trough exits to the east. A high pressure
ridge will build over the western US through the rest of the
week and into the weekend, allowing for above normal temperatures
and dry conditions to return.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow throughout the
morning has maintained cloudy skies across western Washington,
with light showers and drizzle lingering over higher terrain
mainly north of the Puget Sound. Cloud cover will persist well
into the afternoon with only partial clearing, which will limit
temperatures across the region several degrees below normal in the
low 70s.

Dry conditions will return on Wednesday as zonal flow develops
aloft and high pressure develops offshore. Cloudy conditions will
scour out by the morning, allowing for temperatures to return to
near normal, near 70 degrees along the coast and the upper 70s to
lower 80s further inland.

High pressure will continue to build northward into western
Washington through the remainder of the week as a strong ridge
amplifies over the western US. Much of the region will see a
return of elevated temperatures paired with dry conditions, with
the lowlands east of the Puget Sound on track to reach 90 degrees
by Friday afternoon. Friday will be the hottest day of the period,
with moderate (orange) HeatRisk potential across many lowlands
surrounding the Puget Sound. The immediate coast will remain much
cooler in the 70s with a persistent belt of marine stratus
expected to cool things off under weak onshore flow.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Ensembles remain in good
agreement over hot and dry conditions through the weekend and
into early next week. Weak troughing offshore is likely to cool
things off a few degrees over the weekend, with an influx of cloud
cover likely on Saturday. Low-level onshore flow will also likely
limit high tempeartures over the weekend and into next week,
though above normal temperatures will continue. Forecast models
continue to show the potential for thunderstorms over higher
terrain triggered by weak shortwaves moving across the region, but
confidence is low at this time.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest flow aloft turning more westerly into
Wednesday. Marine stratus is socked in over W WA with MVFR to
pockets of IFR to LIFR observed. Brief improvement to low-end VFR is
possible across the interior terminals this afternoon into the early
evening, but widespread MVFR (with isolated IFR to LIFR) cigs are
likely to return by 06-09z Wednesday. Better improvement is likely
into Wednesday afternoon allowing a return of widespread MVFR.

KSEA...MVFR cigs as of 1935z. Improvement to low-end VFR remains in
the cards in the between the window of 20z Tuesday - 08z Wednesday.
However, low-end MVFR cigs (20-25% IFR) are to rebound and persist
into Wednesday morning before VFR returns 19-22z Wednesday. SW
surface winds this afternoon between 5-10 kt gradually turning
northerly overnight into Wednesday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure offshore will steadily build over area
waters throughout the week. Diurnally driven northerly winds will
develop over the coastal waters through the rest of the week, but
will look to remain under advisory/warning threshold. Seas 3 to 5 ft
through the week before building towards  6 to 7 ft for the outer
coastal waters. Combined with a short period there could be steep
seas, especially farther offshore in the outer water zones
throughout the weekend. Seas return back to 3 to 5 ft into the
beginning of next week.
