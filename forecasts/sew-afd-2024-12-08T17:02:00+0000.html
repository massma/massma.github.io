Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
902 AM PST Sun Dec 8 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A low pressure system will continue to produce areas
of precipitation through Sunday afternoon, including snow in the
mountains, and rain in the lowlands. A couple of dry days will
follow on Monday and Tuesday as high pressure builds back in. The
pattern will return to unsettled on Wednesday through next weekend
with several systems passing through bringing additional chances
of precipitation.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The latest forecast remains
on track with no updates this morning. Precipitation continues
across western Washington this morning from a surface trough just
off the coast. A previous cold frontal boundary yesterday has
brought snow levels down to around 3,000 feet as of yesterday.
This has transitioned the precipitation to snow in the mountains,
with a lot more still to fall in the Cascades and Olympics today.
The heaviest of this will be concentrated in the Cascades, where
showers will likely linger longer post front through the evening
(via convergence zone). Still expecting another half inch to an
inch and a half of liquid through the day today in this region
(equivalent to an additional 6 to 12 inches at
Snoqualmie/Stevens/White Passes). Some of the highest peaks may
see as much as 2 feet of snow. Will continue the winter headlines
in place, and again the heaviest of the snow will fall through
around noon before tapering down this afternoon. Rates may reach
1-2 inches an hour (especially in convergence/convective areas).
For lowland areas, the activity will continue to produce rain
showers throughout the day. Coverage is not expected to be as
widespread today. This will limit QPF to around a tenth to a
quarter of an inch for most areas (half an inch along the coast).
Additionally, for beaches along the Pacific Coast, waves are
expected to remain below 20 ft (closer to 16 ft) - below the
threshold needed for a high surf advisory. The breezy south winds
in the Cascades will diminish going into the afternoon as well,
and they will be light out of the south everywhere else.

Moving ahead, the trough/low will move inland today and again fill
over the Northern Plains. A ridge will follow the trough - expect
high pressure to begin building back in Monday and Tuesday. Cloud
cover (with some patchy fog) will slowly decrease Monday with
some sunshine by the afternoon. The polar jet will bring some
cooler Canadian air in, which will knock high and low temperatures
down into the mid 40s/low 30s respectively.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Majority of the models
are now showing a shortwave trough following the ridge Wednesday
into Thursday with an associated frontal system. This will
increase precipitation chances Wednesday into Thursday (but it
does not appear the precipitation will be heavy at this time). A
more prominent trough appears to develop next weekend, but there`s
no good agreement at this time on where it will go inland, or how
strong it will be. Temperatures will remain relatively steady with
lows in the mid 30s, and highs in the 40s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough will move through the area
midday. Northwesterly flow aloft will become northerly behind the
trough. Surface high pressure building offshore will move inland
tonight and Monday.

Mostly MVFR ceilings expected into the afternoon hours. Ceilings
will improve to VFR mid afternoon. Ceilings will then lower back
down to MVFR with pockets of IFR 06z-09z tonight. MVFR ceilings with
isolated IFR ceilings are expected to persist through most of Monday
morning.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings improve to VFR mid afternoon. Ceilings are
expected to  lower to MVFR around 06z tonight and continue through
Monday morning. Surface winds southerly 8 to 12 knots will ease to 4
to 8 knots after 21z. Winds become variable 5 knots or less after
06z tonight.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure will rebuild across the
waters today and move inland tonight. The ridge will remain over
the waters into Wednesday. Another front will reach the area
late Wednesday into Thursday.

Small craft advisory winds over portions of the coastal waters as
well as the Central and Eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca will ease
below 20 knots late morning/early afternoon today. Winds remaining
below 20 knots through Wednesday. Possible small craft advisory
winds coastal waters with the next front late Wednesday or
Thursday.

Seas 10 to 15 feet subsiding Monday morning to less than 10 feet.
Seas building back over 10 feet, 10 to 12 feet, Wednesday night
and Thursday.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Shower activity today will not be hydrologically
significant with snow levels lowering. The flood watch for the
Skokomish river in mason county will be cancelled with this
forecast package. Next round of precipitation later in the week at
this point looks like it will only cause minor rises on area
rivers.
