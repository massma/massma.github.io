Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
302 PM PST Sun Jan 5 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Areas of drizzle and a few showers linger this
afternoon. An upper ridge will build offshore on Monday for drier
weather Monday and Tuesday, along with morning fog. A weakening
front will move across Western Washington Tuesday night into early
Wednesday. Ridging expected on Thursday with the next frontal
system on Friday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Areas of drizzle along
with a few showers continue this afternoon with abundant moisture
at the surface. This will continue through this evening before
generally drier conditions return on Monday. Some clearing may
occur early tonight, especially for northern areas, which will
promote fog development, in addition to low stratus Monday morning
across Puget Sound. Stratus and fog are expected to clear by
early afternoon on Monday for some sunshine around Puget Sound as
the upper ridge continues to build. The SW/NE oriented ridge axis
will then shift overheard on Tuesday for continued dry conditions.
Another round of morning fog on Tuesday, with dense fog possible
for some areas especially across southern Puget Sound.

The ridge will flatten Tuesday night as a weakening front moves
eastward across Western Washington. Light precipitation is
expected Tuesday night into early Wednesday morning, especially
for the Olympic Peninsula and King County northward. However,
QPF is generally light as the front will weaken as it progresses
across the area, with no impacts expected. Otherwise, temperatures
will be near normal in the mid to upper 40s for highs through
Wednesday, although some areas may remain cooler depending on how
late stratus and fog clears Monday and Tuesday.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Ensembles are consistent in
the ridge building back over Western Washington later Wednesday
into Thursday for drier conditions. A more organized frontal
system is forecast to move through Friday as troughing slides
southward from BC into the interior Pacific Northwest. This will
result in the return of lowland rain, higher elevation mountain
snowfall, and a slight increase in winds. Ensembles then rebuild
the upper ridge offshore next weekend leading to another round of
generally drier conditions. However, will have to monitor any
additional troughs along the NE periphery of the ridging, with
continued NW allowing for at least slight precipitation chances
over the Olympics and Cascades. Temperatures to remain near normal
into later next week. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Flow aloft will transition to more north- northeasterly
tonight as a weak system passes mostly to the south of the region
and upper ridging begins to build offshore. Radar still showing
some post-frontal shower activity across portions of the Sound
this afternoon. Conditions remain a mixed bag this afternoon,
though have started to see some improvement towards MVFR ceilings
for central and south Sound terminals. With plentiful low level
moisture in place and light surface gradients, expect another
round of ceilings and visibilities to drop back down towards more
widespread IFR again overnight in fog/low stratus. Conditions
look to improve towards MVFR again by Monday afternoon. Southerly
winds will gradually transition to the north after 00Z.

KSEA...Ceilings have improved towards MVFR this afternoon. Though,
expect ceilings to likely sink back down to IFR tonight with ample
moisture in the low levels. Fog possible at the terminal Monday
morning, which could bring brief periods of LIFR conditions.
Surface winds southwesterly persisting at 4-7 kt transitioning to
northerly 4-7 kt between 03-06Z. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak surface trough and associated front will move into
the Oregon coastal waters tonight. A long period westerly swell
moving into the coastal waters tonight into Monday will interact
with a more dominant, shorter period wave group to bring a period
of confused seas to the coastal waters through Monday morning.

A strengthening surface ridge over British Columbia will then
bring increasing offshore flow to the waters on Monday and
Tuesday. Easterlies may occasionally reach small craft advisory
criteria near the west entrance to the strait and across portions
of the coastal waters during that time frame. A dissipating front
then looks to move into the area waters around midweek, bringing
little impact to the region. High pressure then looks to rebuild
over the area waters Thursday before a front moves into the region
again on Friday.

Seas over the coastal waters could briefly build to 10 feet
Monday night and again near midweek. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
