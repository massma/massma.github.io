Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
1211 AM EST Wed Jan 24 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
A frontal boundary moves south into the region tonight. The frontal
boundary remains within the area through Wednesday and then moves
north as a warm front Wednesday night. Low pressure passes to
our north and west Thursday night through Friday, dragging a
cold front through early Friday. Brief high pressure passes
through the area Friday night through early Saturday. Low
pressure then approaches from the south and west and impacts the
area late Saturday through early Monday. High pressure likely
builds in thereafter.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM THIS MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>* A Winter Weather Advisory is in effect for portions of
  northeast NJ, the Lower Hudson Valley and interior Southern CT.

The system appears to have turned into a rain-snow mix with
rain for coastal areas and snow occurring in interior areas.
A trace to an inch of snow is still expected, with a small
window of concern for freezing rain in the early morning before
temperatures rise. For now, road temperatures across the area
remain above freezing with the exception of interior locations
in Connecticut where snow is falling at the time of this update.
THe forecast remains on track with only minor changes made to
temperatures.

The timing of chances of freezing rain is early Wednesday
morning. The coverage of freezing rain could very well be more
patchy and limited to the higher elevations.

There is uncertainty with the temperatures and precipitation
but with forecasts of at least chance freezing rain and light
ice accumulation, this was enough of a warrant to keep winter
weather advisory.

A frontal boundary moves southward into the area overnight. The
front moving from northern New England southward into the local
region looks to come to a halt. Strong high pressure remains
centered SE Canada into northern New England.

Warm nose conveyed by model BUFKIT soundings moves in overnight with
a few degrees above 0 degree C shown within a layer between 750 and
900mb.

At the surface, low temperatures tonight a blend of 75 percent
raw consensus and 25 percent NBM. Lows range along the coast
near 33 to 34 degrees F and near 30 to 32 degrees F to the north
across the interior.

Lift forcing appears to be rather weak with dampened mid level
shortwave in forecast shown to move across late tonight into early
Wednesday morning. So, precipitation will remain for the most
part, light.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM THIS MORNING THROUGH 6 PM THURSDAY/...
With the frontal boundary remaining in the region, precipitation
remains in the forecast. However, slight mid level ridging
shown in the forecast models. Vertical lift limited even more.
Model precipitation forecasts very little additional liquid
equivalent shown 12-18Z Wednesday.

Then an approaching wave of low pressure will allow for the
front to move north as a warm front Wednesday night. This will
allow for precipitation to transition everywhere to plain rain
as southerly flow increases. The rain becomes likely going into
Wednesday night with further increases in southerly flow.
Vertical forcing increases with more mid level positive
vorticity advection.

High temperatures forecast Wednesday a blend of NBM and MOS
consensus with further manual refinements, ranging mainly from
the low to mid 40s. Temperatures forecast to lower into early
Wednesday evening to mid 30s to lower 40s and then increase
during the night after passage of warm front. Temperatures and
dewpoints rise well into the 40s later Wednesday night.

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
Unsettled weather is expected through much of the long term period.
The period starts out with a frontal boundary to our north and high
pressure centered offshore to our south and east. A deep SW/W flow
will allow for advection of warm, moist air. Rain will be ongoing
early Thursday and is expected to continue through at least Thursday
night. Although moderate rain is possible at times, no hydrologic
issues are expected. Under an inch is forecast from Thursday through
Thursday night and it will fall over 24 hours. The NBM currently has
a 30 to 50 percent chance of reaching 1 inch over that 24 hour
period. The frontal boundary does look to sag south a bit during the
day on Thursday, but then by Thursday night into Friday morning a
wave low pressure will move along the boundary and pass to our north
and west. This will drag a cold front through early Friday. The
ongoing warming trend that started last weekend will continue until
Friday. Highs on Friday Are currently forecast to be in the low 50s
to low 60s.

High pressure then briefly builds in allowing for one of the only
dry periods during the long term. Meanwhile, low pressure forms and
strengthens over the Deep South. This low will lift towards the area
and likely bring impacts late Saturday through early Monday. The
latest guidance shows the event starting as all rain and then
switching over to snow from northwest to southeast as cold air wraps
into the system.

Thereafter high pressure likely builds in and dry conditions are
expected late Monday through Tuesday.

&&

.AVIATION /05Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
A weak cold front sags south, meeting up with warm front from
the southwest and creating a nearly stationary front over the
region tonight into Wednesday.

VFR cigs prevail for almost the entire area despite light rain
and a mix of snow and sleet into the northern tier. Cigs
expected to drop to MVFR through 6Z for KSWF, KHPN, KBDR, and
KGON as wintry mix moves in. IFR cigs remain possible through
the morning but confidence in timing and occurrence is low at
this time.

Low confidence in timing of cigs dropping to MVFR for the NYC
and coastal terminals over the next few hours. MVFR cigs
expected by the morning push. VCSH possible for the NYC
terminals as well though the more impactful aspect will likely
be the cigs when they eventually do come down.

A wintry mix inland will work its way down to the CT coast into
the overnight, but this will generally be light and spotty. For
the NYC and KISP terminals, sleet could briefly mix in.

Light and variable winds become an E/NE direction into the
overnight. Winds will then gradually veer to SE on Wednesday.

     NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Amendments for the timing of category changes is highly likely
due to a complex forecast. Sleet could mix in overnight in what
will generally be spotty light rain. Temperatures are forecast
to remain above freezing.

OUTLOOK FOR 00Z THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...

Wednesday Night-Thursday Night...MVFR/IFR. Periods of rain
mostly from Wednesday night through Thursday night.

Friday...Chance of MVFR/IFR/rain AM. Improvement to VFR by
afternoon.

Saturday...Mainly VFR. MVFR or lower developing in rain at
night.

Sunday...MVFR or lower in rain. E-NE G20-25kt.

.MARINE...
A weak pressure gradient will keep conditions on the waters
below SCA criteria with relatively light winds and seas of less
than 3 ft. Conditions increase late Wednesday night for both
winds and seas with increasing SCA potential. However, non-
ocean zones are expected to remain below SCA thresholds.

The forecast has wind gusts getting to 25 kt for much of the
ocean and ocean seas building to 5 ft between Moriches and
Montauk late Wednesday night. With timing and areal uncertainty
of SCA conditions, held off on issuance of SCA for this
timeframe.

Winds and waves look to remain below SCA criteria Thursday through
much of Saturday. Low pressure then impacts the area, with potential
for SCA criteria late Saturday through Monday night. At this time,
peak gusts looks to be Sunday night, with 25 to 30 kt gusts on the
ocean waters and eastern Sound, and around 25 kt elsewhere. Waves on
the ocean may also reach 6 to 8 feet by Sunday night.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
Around 0.4 to 0.5 inch of rain forecast Wednesday afternoon
through Wednesday night.

No hydrologic impacts are expected through early next week.
