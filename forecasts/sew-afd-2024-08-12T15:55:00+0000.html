Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
855 AM PDT Mon Aug 12 2024

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Stratus across much of Western Washington this morning
with patchy drizzle along the southern coast. Some clearing
expected into this afternoon for the interior. Otherwise, there
remains approximately a 20-35% chance of thunderstorms this
afternoon in the North Cascades, particularly along the Cascade
crest. No major forecast updates this morning.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...Upper level troughing over the region will promote
onshore flow and cooler temperatures the next several days.
Isolated thunderstorms will be possible across the North Cascades
today and Tuesday. More widespread chances of precipitation may
return to western Washington by the weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Troughing over the Pac NW
will keep western WA mostly cloudy and cool over the next several
days. No signs of the aurora from NWS Seattle overnight due to the
cloud cover, but others were lucky with a few breaks. The focus
for today will be showers and possible thunderstorms over the
North Cascades once again, especially near the crest. There are
some nocturnal showers near the crest early this morning but we
should see activity increasing this afternoon and evening.
Elsewhere, the coast may see a little light rain this morning
under the stratus layer. Temperatures will track a few degrees
cooler than average with highs in the 60s to lower 70s.

The trough makes little progression on Tuesday and we`ll continue
to see onshore flow and cloudy/cool weather. There`s another
threat of showers and thunderstorms near the crest in the North
Cascades.

The trough exits east on Wednesday and we`ll see higher heights
and slightly warmer conditions over western WA. Interior
temperatures will reach the mid to upper 70s - just a degree or
two shy of normals. NW winds will keep the coast in the 60s. 33

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...An upper level low will
drop down from Canada and spin offshore as we move though the
latter half of the week. Onshore flow will be lighter, for the
most part, and we should see more sunbreaks during the afternoon
and early evening hours. Temperatures stick in the 60s and 70s
with lows in the 50s. Showers (and possible thunderstorms) are
expected in the mountains both Thursday and Friday. Shower
coverage expands to all of western WA over the weekend as the low
pulls in additional moisture. 33

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper-low overhead with variable winds aloft. Cloud
bases this morning are higher then they have been the past few days,
keeping most stations MVFR to low-end VFR. A similar evolution to
yesterday is expected with the cloud deck slowly breaking up this
afternoon into this evening, but never fully evaporating. A return
to more widespread VFR is likely after the 21z time frame but
there`s an isolated chance of some locations not improving at all.
Widespread stratus is certain to redevelop Monday night into Tuesday
morning. Surface winds winds will remain west-southwesterly 5 to 10
kt throughout the TAF period.

KSEA...Low-end VFR conditions continue this morning and will likely
remain through most of the day as the stratus slowly breaks apart. A
return to MVFR conditions is expected early Tuesday morning as the
stratus remains and redevelop. Winds remain west-southwesterly at 5
to 10 kt.

.MARINE...Broad high pressure over the East Pacific will continue
onshore flow over the area waters. Diurnally driven pushes down the
Strait of Juan de Fuca will occur each evening with no signs of SCA
level winds for the next few days. Seas are to range between 3 to 6
feet throughout much of the upcoming week. Can`t rule out visibility
restrictions at times with the possibility of mist squeezing out of
marine stratus.
