Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
343 PM EDT Mon Oct 28 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over New England shifts offshore tonight into
Tuesday, allowing a warm front to pass through the Northeast
during Tuesday night. High pressure otherwise remains over the
Western Atlantic Wednesday and Thursday before a cold front
passage on Friday. High pressure then returns for the upcoming
weekend into early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM TUESDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure centered over New England will shift towards the coast
with a light SE flow in the low levels, transporting some moisture
our way along a weak inverted trough. The moisture will be shallow,
confined mainly below 850mb with little lift. Still looks like the
combination of moisture and lift through at least tonight is not
enough for rainfall, so will continue with a dry forecast. There
could be patchy frost in Orange County with temps falling into the
mid 30s, but not widespread enough for an advisory. Low temps
otherwise in the 40s for most of the area, and around 50 for NYC
metro.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Moisture will continue to pool along the trough through Tuesday,
with more of an impact over the eastern half of the forecast area.
Even so, the moisture remains fairly shallow, but isentropic lift
generally increases as the day wears on. Will therefore keep a
slight chance/chance of light rain/drizzle focused more towards the
eastern half of the area with better overall chances in the
afternoon. High temperatures averaging around 5 degrees above normal
in the lower and middle 60s.

A warm front approaches and passes through during Tuesday night.
This will bring deeper moisture and stronger lift, but the
combination of both ingredients are still lacking to warrant any
PoPs higher than chance. The rainfall threat then exits east near
daybreak. Mild low temperatures in the 50s with the help of cloud
cover and warm air advection.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Two main themes in the long term will be unseasonably warm weather
Wednesday through Friday and the continued dry conditions into early
November.

A warm front will continue pushing well north and east of the area
Wednesday morning. This is in response to an anomalously strong
ridge building over the eastern seaboard. The ridge slowly works
offshore Wednesday night before gradually weakening Thursday. The
ridging will help support another unseasonably warm air mass over
the Tri-State Wednesday and Thursday. Highs on Wednesday will reach
the 70s for much of the area, warmest across NE NJ and the Lower
Hudson Valley where upper 70s are possible. Even warmer air advects
into the area on Thursday with stronger southwest flow as the
ridging pushes offshore. NBM deterministic temperatures on Thursday
look low and have blended in the NBM 90th percentile, which seem
more reasonable given the unseasonably warm pattern. Highs should be
around 80 degrees in NE NJ and the Lower Hudson Valley with middle
to upper 70s elsewhere. The east end of Long Island should stay in
the lower 70s. See climate section below as record highs are
possible.

The next northern stream shortwave trough approaches Thursday night,
sending a cold front towards the area. The latest model consensus
has the front moving through on Friday, probably late morning into
early afternoon. The amplitude of the trough varies between the
deterministic and ensemble guidance. There is a chance for light
measurable rain, mainly early Friday. Not enough confidence to go
with PoPs higher than 40 percent as there is enough guidance that
remains mostly dry. Temperatures will still be unseasonably warm on
Friday, but not as warm as Wednesday and Thursday. Highs look to
reach the upper 60s to around 70 degrees.

The upper trough and cold front move offshore Friday night with
ridging returning at the surface and aloft. Another strong ridge
continues to be signaled over the southeast stretching into the
northeast. The ridge could linger into early next week keeping
conditions dry. Temperatures will be near seasonable levels this
weekend before trending above normal next Monday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /19Z MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure near the region will eventually move offshore Tuesday.

Mainly VFR conditions are expected through the TAF period. There is
a chance for MVFR stratus and perhaps some spotty light rain early
Tuesday, mainly east of NYC terminals.

Regarding winds, mainly SE winds near 5 to 10 kts expected through
much of the TAF period. KLGA will have more NE flow and for most
terminals tonight into early Tuesday, wind directions will be more
variable.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

A low chance for MVFR late tonight into Tuesday morning. If
probability for MVFR increases, will put into TAF.

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

Tuesday: Mainly VFR, but chance of MVFR east of the city terminals
for afternoon. Chance for light rain most terminals at night with
MVFR possible. S-SE wind gusts 15-20 kt afternoon into early evening.

Wednesday: Mainly VFR, but chance of MVFR east of the city terminals
for early Wednesday with possible light rain.

Thursday: VFR initially, but a chance of MVFR late Thursday night
with possible rain showers. SW wind gusts 15-20 kt.

Friday: Possible MVFR with showers. Improving conditions, VFR
becoming more probable at night. SW-W wind gusts 15-20
kt for the day. Gusts gradually diminish in the evening. Winds
become more NW at night.

Saturday: VFR.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Winds will be light tonight, then increase through Tuesday.
Conditions on all waters should remain below advisory criteria
through the daytime. Winds probably peak Tuesday evening with gusts
to 25kt possible on the ocean waters east of Fire Island Inlet. Seas
may also increase over 5 ft during Tuesday night as well. With this
being a 3rd period low-end advisory event, and with collaboration
with WFO BOX, will hold off on issuing a SCA for the time being and
allow subsequent shifts see if trends support a SCA issuance.

Winds and seas will remain below SCA levels on Wednesday. Winds
increase and seas build on Thursday ahead of an approaching cold
front. SCA conditions are possible Thursday into Thursday night,
especially on the ocean. Elevated seas may linger on Friday, but
conditions should then largely remain below SCA levels into
Saturday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.FIRE WEATHER...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Min RH values between 25 and 35% for the rest of today with a
Special Weather Statement continuing for all CT and NJ land zones to
highlight the continued risk of wildfire spread, should ignition
occur.

Afternoon minimum RH values climb to over 50% for Tuesday. Coupled
with relatively light winds, this should lower the risk of wildfire
spread, though mainly dry conditions are expected to persist into
late week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>There are no hydrologic concerns through early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
