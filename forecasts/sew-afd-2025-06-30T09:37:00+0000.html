Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
237 AM PDT Mon Jun 30 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure aloft will maintain warm and dry
conditions across the region early this week. As the high
pressure weakens toward midweek, expect a return to near normal
temperatures. Most areas remain dry through the week, though a
few showers are possible near the coast and mountains by the end
of the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure remains in
place over the region this morning, setting the stage for
another warm and dry day across Western Washington. Expect
temperatures to trend a few degrees warmer today than
yesterday, with widespread 80s this afternoon and the warmest
spots approaching or reaching the 90 degree mark. This will
maintain an area of Moderate (Orange) HeatRisk across the
interior from central Puget Sound southward, as well as in the
foothills and Cascade valleys. Developing onshore flow Tuesday
will usher in a cooler day for the coastal areas and spots west
of Puget Sound, but not much relief for the urban corridor from
Seattle to Tacoma. Similarly, warmer conditions linger eastward
into the Cascade valleys will the cooling marine air won`t
solidly arrive until Wednesday. This deeper marine push
Wednesday will bring temperature down closer to normal. While
precipitation isn`t expected, there should be some additional
clouds in the morning and midday hours.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...Confidence in the
specifics of the pattern late in the week, including the
Independence Day holiday, remains rather low with ensemble
guidance continuing to exhibit a rather large spread in how the
pattern may evolve. The forecast continues to reflect the most
likely scenario of a generally zonal flow pattern that will
provide for some morning clouds and temperatures close to (or
slightly above) seasonal normals. This would leave the door open
to perhaps a few light showers near the northern coast and in
the North Cascades over the weekend, but even in these favored
locations the chance of rain remains quite low (less than 20
percent) for the weekend.                               12<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper ridge axis will continue to gradually shift
east of the area today with light west to southwest aloft. The air
mass remains dry and stable with the exception of a shallow marine
layer along the immediate coast. VFR conditions will prevail across
the majority of the region today. Increasing low level onshore flow
will bring LIFR/IFR stratus inland through the Chehalis Gap and
Strait of Juan de Fuca late tonight, but it is unlikely to reach
terminals east of Puget Sound on Tuesday morning.

KSEA...VFR. Surface winds northeasterly 7 knots or less early
becoming N/NW 8 to 11 knots this afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface ridging centered over the offshore waters and
thermally induced low pressure across the interior of Western
Washington will lead to continued gusty northwest winds and choppy
seas across the coastal waters into tonight. The thermal trough over
the interior will gradually shift eastward tonight resulting in
progressively stronger westerly pushes in the Strait of Juan de Fuca
later today and again on Tuesday. A dissipating front and associated
upper trough will swing across the waters late Wednesday before weak
surface ridging rebuilds across the waters late in the week. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the region will maintain warm
and dry conditions across the region through midweek. Expect
daytime RH values to dip to around 30-35% across the Cascades
and from central Puget Sound southward. Expect elevated fire
weather conditions with a few spots perhaps approaching 25%.
Light north or northeast breezes increase in the afternoons. Only
modest RH recoveries Tuesday morning in the Cascades under the
inversion, though areas west of Puget Sound will see some
influence from a marine push. A deeper marine push Wednesday
will bring better recoveries and cooler temperatures later in
the week. However, outside of some 20% shower chances in the
North Cascades and near the coast over the weekend, precipitation
is not expected through the week ahead.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
