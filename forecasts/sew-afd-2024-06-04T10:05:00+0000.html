.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The next frontal system associated with the
atmospheric river event will move across the region this morning,
bringing another round of rain and gusty winds to western Washington.
Showers will continue in its wake, but will taper tonight into
Wednesday. Drier and warmer conditions are expected the second
half of the week as upper level ridging builds across the West. A
weak trough moving across the area may bring some showers to the
mountains Sunday into Monday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The next frontal system
associated with the atmospheric river event will move across
western Washington this morning, with radar already showing the
next round of rain pushing into the interior. Overall, do not
expect conditions to be as wet as they were with the previous
system. The heaviest rainfall will be in the mountains, where an
additional 1-2 inches will be possible through the day. Additional
totals along the coast through tonight generally remain between a
quarter of an inch to half an inch and can range from a few hundredths
of an inch to half an inch across the interior lowlands. Isolated
thunderstorms will be possible as well, so locally higher amounts
will be possible in any convective showers. Latest hi-res guidance
does hint at a relatively short-lived convergence zone developing
across the northern Sound in the wake of the front later this
morning. Rain will then taper to showers this afternoon and
evening. In addition to precipitation, southerly winds will also
remain gusty through the morning hours, with winds generally
persisting at 15 to 25 mph, and gusts up to 40 mph possible. Winds
gradually look to decrease again by the late morning hours. Showers
will continue to taper region-wide by tonight and afternoon high
temperatures will generally be in the low 60s.

An upper level ridge will then start to build across the West
Wednesday into Thursday, bringing warmer and drier conditions to
the region the second half of the week. Skies will clear out on
Wednesday for some sun and afternoon high temperatures will
rebound closer to normal - topping out in the upper 60s to low 70s
in spots. With the upper ridge strengthening on Thursday, expect
temperatures to climb a few more degrees and to top out in the
upper 60s to mid 70s for the majority of the area.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Both deterministic and
ensemble guidance indicate upper level ridging influencing the
Pacific Northwest headed into the weekend. The ridge axis will
then gradually move inland and push east on Saturday, opening the
door for a weak shortwave trough to traverse the region on
Sunday. Friday and Saturday currently look like the warmest days
of the long term, with temperatures expected to climb into the
upper 70s to low 80s across the area. Heat risk generally expected
to remain in the minor category for the majority of western
Washington for now, though could see some isolated spots of
moderate primarily along the Cascade valleys on Friday- where
temperatures could reach the mid to upper 80s. A weak trough will
then move across the area on Sunday. At this time, guidance does
not indicate much in the way of precipitation outside of a few
showers in the mountains. However, can expect cloudier conditions
and for highs to cool a few degrees on Sunday. Light showers may
linger across the higher terrain into Monday. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Stronger westerly flow aloft will continue through today
with an upper trough over British Columbia. Generally VFR/MVFR cigs
early this morning with areas of IFR along the coast and near KPWT.
Cigs will continue to lower this morning with increasing showers as
a frontal system moves across the area. Generally MVFR/IFR cigs
expected through the morning. Improvements in cigs to more BKN
MVFR/VFR expected this afternoon. Convective showers this afternoon
with a slight chance of thunderstorms, mainly King County northward
and into the Cascades. Breezy southerly winds this morning with
gusts ranging 20 to 35 kts, with winds becoming more W/SW this
afternoon.

KSEA...VFR cigs will lower to MVFR generally between 09-11z. Cigs
will remain MVFR through the morning before improvements to BKN VFR
this afternoon. Cigs may fall to IFR this morning (mainly between 14-
18z) but confidence is low. Otherwise, showers at times through the
early afternoon. Breezy southerly winds gusting to 25 to 35 kts
through this morning becoming more SW this afternoon and easing a
bit into this evening. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong front will move across the area through this
morning with additional stronger winds for the waters. Gale force
southerly winds are expected at times for the Coastal Waters, as
well as eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca, Admiralty Inlet, and
northern inland waters through this morning. Southerly winds will
also remain breezy for Puget Sound as well. Winds will become more
southwesterly midday through the afternoon and slowly ease for most
waters. A westerly push is expected through the Strait of Juan de
Fuca this afternoon into this evening for additional SCA winds in
this area. High pressure will then build Wednesday and remain over
western Washington into the weekend for a less active weather
pattern.

Seas of 8 to 11 feet today will build towards 12 to 15 feet tonight
into Wednesday morning. Seas will slowly subside below 10 feet on
Thursday, but breezy northerly winds are expected over the Coastal
Waters late week into the weekend. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Another round of precipitation will continue to move
across western Washington today. Additional rainfall amounts of
1-2 inches will be possible for the Olympics and Cascades. A
quarter of an inch to half an inch are forecast for the coast and
a few hundredths to a half an inch are forecast for the lowlands.
Area rivers are likely to remain below flood stage, however
slight rises will still be likely with additional precipitation
through this evening. In addition to river flooding, gusty winds
have caused tree debris to fall to the surface. With additional
rainfall and wind expected today, urban drains may become clogged,
and standing water and minor flooding will be possible. Thus, the
Flood Watch will remain in place. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
