Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
306 AM PDT Sat Jun 28 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level high pressure builds over the region
through the day, bringing increased sunshine and warmer
conditions. This ridge remains in place through the start of
next week, with Monday likely the warmest day for most. The
ridge slide eastward around Tuesday, with another disturbance
arriving around midweek.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure begins to
build overhead later today, bringing a shift to a warmer and dry
pattern across the area this weekend and into the start of next
week. Some lingering patches of fog or low clouds remain in
parts of the lowlands this morning, but expect these to clear
through the day. For the weekend, temperatures top out in the
upper 70s to lower 80s inland, with a Minor HeatRisk across the
region. With the ridge overhead and perhaps some light offshore
flow, expect that Monday will be the warmest day across the
area with temperatures into the mid to upper 80s. A few of the
warmest spots could reach 90. This will lead to a corridor of
Moderate (Orange) HeatRisk extending from around Seattle through
Tacoma as well as east into the Cascade valleys. In addition to
the heat concerns, expect that daytime RH values will dip into
the 25-35% range. Despite some recent rain, some of the grasses
other fine fuels likely will dry out in this stretch and could
elevate fire weather concerns for the start of next week.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...Expect some slight
moderation in temperatures with the ridge shifting eastward and
an eventual return to cooling onshore flow, but it may not be
early or fast enough to prevent another day with temperatures
climbing into the 80s inland. This could maintain a second day
of Moderate HeatRisk in the greater Seattle area and extending
eastward into the foothills and Cascade valleys. While ensemble
guidance does depict a wider array of possible outcomes from
around midweek onward, the most likely scenario remains the
influence of the next disturbance sliding across the region
around Wednesday. This will bring a boost in cloud cover and
knock afternoon high temperatures down to the 70s. Confidence
remains low into the later portions of next week with the
evolution of the pattern.   12<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough will shift east of the region this
morning and an upper ridge will begin to build across the area with
northwest flow aloft. Light surface flow will turn northerly this
afternoon. A mixed bag of mostly VFR/MVFR ceilings this morning will
lift to primarily VFR by around 20Z-21Z this afternoon then
eventually scatter out areawide this evening.

KSEA...Cloud decks around 040-060 appear to have slowed the
formation of lower clouds thus far this morning. General thinking is
that an MVFR deck around 025 will still materialize this morning
before lifting back to VFR this afternoon and scattering out this
evening as subsidence with upper ridging takes over. Surface winds
light and variable this morning will become northerly this afternoon
and rise to 7 to 10 knots near or after 00Z.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface ridging over the coastal and offshore waters will
remain in place into early next week while thermally induced low
pressure expands northward across the interior. This will gradually
increase northwesterly onshore flow across the coastal waters by
later in the weekend. Diurnal driven westerly pushes in the strait
will increase early next week...potentially reaching small craft
advisory levels later Monday and near gale Tuesday in the central
and east portions of the strait. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
