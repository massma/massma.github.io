Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
829 PM PST Tue Nov 19 2024

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Strong winds have been observed at Sea-Tac and Paine
Field airports. Additionally, with the numerous impacts being
reported across the area, have expanded the High Wind Warning to
include the Seattle and Everett and Vicinity zones through 4 AM
Wednesday morning. Otherwise, the forecast remains on track. See
the remaining discussion, as well as updates the aviation and
marine sections below. 62<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong offshore storm system will continue to
strengthen today, generating significant east to southeast winds
across western Washington alongside widespread lowland rain and
mountain snow today into Wednesday. Troughing offshore will
continue through the rest of the week, maintaining unsettled
conditions across the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...An anomalously strong low
pressure system offshore will continue to strengthen into the
evening tonight, generating strong pressure gradients that will
cause significant east to southeast winds across western Washington.
The strongest winds are on track to ramp up quickly and occur along
the Pacific Coast and western Cascade Foothills, where gusts could
reach 60-65 mph this evening. Wind gusts elsewhere will likely peak
in the 40-50 mph range this evening. The strong winds through the
Cascade gaps combined with incoming snowfall will cause blizzard
conditions through the Cascade Passes this evening through early
Wednesday morning, where visibilities will be reduced at times to
whiteout conditions in blowing snow. With snow levels between 2000-
3000 ft, the Cascade Passes will see snow totals of 3 to 7 inches
with up to 12 inches over higher elevations through Wednesday
afternoon. The lowlands will also see steady rainfall through
Wednesday morning before rainfall transitions to showers, with
accumulations up to half an inch in the interior and up to an inch
and a half along the Pacific Coast.

The low situated offshore will weaken and shift northward on
Wednesday, swinging another front across western Washington that
will maintain shower activity throughout the day as winds slowly
ease. A large upper level trough will stall offshore through the
remainder of the week, with a series of shortwave disturbances set
to pass northward across the region. This will continually bring
moisture northward into the area, maintaining scattered showers and
cloudy skies. Precipitation amounts will lighten with snow levels
lifting to 3000-4000 ft by Thursday and above 4000-5000 ft by
Friday. The Cascade Passes will see continued light snowfall
accumulations on Thursday and Friday with little to no impact to
travel.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Extended forecast models
show potential for an active weather pattern to continue into early
next week. Ensemble cluster analysis shows good agreement over
general troughing through the weekend and next week, but models show
uncertainty over the intensity and placement of storm systems.
Forecast runs continue to show inconsistent solutions, so a chance
for lowland rain and light mountain snow has been maintained through
the forecast period.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Deep upper level low pressure remains situated just
offshore with strong southwesterly flow aloft. A vigorous frontal
system will sweep onshore overnight. Very strong low level and
surface winds with gusts of 45 to 55 knots at times will continue to
impact terminals through 09Z tonight. Ceilings will be a mix of VFR
and MVFR in light to moderate rain through Wednesday morning before
lifting to mostly VFR in post-frontal scattered showers Wednesday
afternoon. Surface winds will diminish by Wednesday morning but
remain locally breezy through the day.

KSEA...Gusty E/SE surface winds 25 to 35 kts with gusts 45 to persist
through around 09Z before gradually diminishing. Ceilings will
occasionally dip to MVFR by morning as lower levels of air mass
moisten up. Mainly low end VFR in scattered showers expected
Wednesday PM. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong, robust area of low pressure (sub 960 mb),
will impact the coastal waters this afternoon into Wednesday. Key
points for the marine forecast are outlined below:

* Seas: Seas 10 to 15 feet expected to build to 25 to 30 feet over
  the outer coastal waters, with 20 to 24 ft closer to the
  Washington coastline. Elevated seas are possible along the Strait
  of Juan de Fuca where greater fetch combined with strong easterly
  winds over a 12-15 hour period could potentially could generate
  seas of 7 to 10 feet. Uncertainty in wave height remains given the
  unusual easterly wind, but expect overall conditions in the
  central Strait to be choppy.

* Wind: Winds have been gusting to storm force (48 kt and greater)
  this afternoon across the coastal waters and portions of the
  Strait of Juan de Fuca. Winds are expected to peak this evening
  and gradually decrease through Wednesday. Winds associated with
  the storm warning call for gusts of 65 kt with sustained speeds of
  40 to 45 kt. There is the potential for gusts to even reach
  Hurricane Force (70 kts), but these winds once again will be in
  the outer coastal water zones (and also way offshore) and will
  likely be brief as the front crosses through the area. Gale
  Warnings are in effect and will continue for the Northern Inland
  Waters, Admiralty Inlet, and the Puget Sound and Hood Canal Waters.

* Grays Harbor Bar: Rough to severe bar conditions will develop
  tonight. Strong easterly winds will contribute to rough bar
  conditions, especially around the ebbs currents. With large waves
  along the immediate coast, winds from the east and ebbs will allow
  for waves to steepen. Conditions are likely to remain hazardous
  across the bar into Wednesday.

Winds and seas will slowly subside in the wake of this system on
Wednesday. Another low pressure system may track northward along the
coastal waters by Friday, bringing another round of gusty winds and
building seas to the region into the weekend.

.HYDROLOGY...The forecasts for the main part of the this
storm system keeps pushing it further south and is changing the
orientation of the flow pattern into the Olympics. It is looking
less likely that precipitation over the Olympics tonight into
Wednesday will push the Skokomish River above flood stage Wednesday.
But since flooding is still possible, the flood watch for Mason
County will continue and in fact was extended in time. There is some
indication that precipitation after the river peaks on Wednesday,
while less than tonight and Wednesday, will see much warmer
conditions that will melt a significant portion of the snow from
last night and tonight, adding to the runoff. That might be enough
to drive the skokomish above flood stage Friday instead, but that is
far from certain.

Elsewhere, no river flooding is expected. Lower snow levels in the
Cascades, as low as 2000 to 3000 ft during the heaviest
precipitation, will limit runoff and reduce any flooding chances for
rivers flowing off the Cascades. Precipitation for the remainder of
the period will come in bursts. This combined with snow levels
remaining relatively low will keep rivers in their banks. The
exception to this will be the Skokomish with the river remaining
near flood stage into the weekend.
