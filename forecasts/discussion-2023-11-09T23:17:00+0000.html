Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
617 PM EST Thu Nov 9 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
A cold front moves through early tonight. High pressure remains
in control through the weekend and is followed by a cold
frontal passage Monday night. High pressure then builds in again
behind the front.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM FRIDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>At 23Z a surface cold front was moving into Western New Jersey,
with a warm front just south of the area...over southern and
central New Jersey and weak low pressure well south and just
east of Long Island. The parent low is well north and west of
the area, north of the Great Lakes. Much of any forcing has
pushed east of the area, and expecting dry conditions here on
out as the secondary low off shore strengthens and the parent
low weakens as they both head east. However, showers developing
over central New Jersey could clip southern Long Island if the
warm front advects farther north, but with the weak low to the
east of the area, it isn`t likely that the warm front will push
any farther north as a northerly flow develops.

Skies will become mostly clear through the first half of tonight,
but clouds are expected to increase after midnight as some divergence
from an upper level jet will enhance a developing frontal wave
moving along the cold front to the south. Guidance continues to keep
precipitation remaining south of the area for Friday, so kept the
forecast dry with a fair amount of cloud cover tonight and
Friday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM FRIDAY MORNING THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure continues to build in for Friday, aiding in
suppressing any precipitation to the south. Cooler conditions
are expected, with highs near normal for this time of year, in
the lower to middle 50s and lows in the 30s to lower 40s. The
high remains in control Friday night, so dry conditions continue
through then as a somewhat zonal flow develops aloft.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A combination of high pres and moisture starved fronts is
expected to keep the area dry thru the period.

A mid 1030s high will build towards the area on Sat, then over
the area on Sun. NW flow will usher in a cool and dry airmass on
Sat. Deep mixing should help to offset the cooling airmass.
Only limiting factor for temps Sat ngt is the wind, keeping most
of the are from max radiational cooling. This seems to be
reflected in the NBM, so it was used for temps.

Winds lighten up on Sun, but highs generally in the mid 40s with a
lack of deep mixing and a cold airmass in place. Better radiational
cooling Sun ngt. Went with the NBM for now, but the numbers could
verify 5 degrees or more colder, closer to what the MEX is
suggesting.

A SW flow develops on Mon as the high settles S of the cwa. The next
cold front comes thru dry Mon ngt attm. A roughly 1030 high then
builds in thru Wed/Thu, keeping the area dry. Mon-Wed blw climo,
then some return flow could warm things up a few degrees for
Thu.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /00Z FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front and frontal wave will exit to the east by early
this evening. High pressure then noses in from the WSW tonight
into Friday, while low pressure tracks across eastern Canada.

VFR through the forecast period, except at KGON where MVFR
strato cu should be moving east by 01Z. Then a mid level cloud
deck moves in from the west overnight at around 12kft and
remains through Friday afternoon.

Light NW winds veer to W late tonight and continue into Friday.
A few gusts 15-20kt will be possible tonight. A occasional gust
will be possible Friday afternoon.

     NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

An occasional gust 15-20 kt possible tonight.

OUTLOOK FOR 00Z SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...

Friday night through Tuesday: VFR. NW G20-25kt on Tuesday.

.MARINE...
Conditions are expected to remain below SCA criteria. The
passage of a cold front may bring gusts to around 25 kt through
early tonight, but right now only expecting it to be occasional,
and limited to near shore. Waves are expected to remain 3 to 4
ft across the ocean waters tonight through Friday night.

Although gusty NW flow is expected on Sat, winds are progged to
remain blw 25 kt attm. Winds and seas blw sca lvls Sun-Mon, then a
cold front could bring winds, and possibly seas, up to sca lvls on
Tue, especially on the ocean. Winds and seas blw sca lvls on Wed
with high pres building in.
