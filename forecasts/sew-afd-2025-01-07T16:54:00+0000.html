Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
854 AM PST Tue Jan 7 2025

.SYNOPSIS...High pressure will build along the Pacific coast
throughout the week, with a weak front moving through western
Washington late Tuesday bringing in light showers along the
Canada border. A more organized system will move through on
Friday, bringing a brief shot of lowland rain and mountain snow to
the region. Dry conditions are on track to return by the end of
the weekend as high pressure rebuilds.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A mix of low clouds and fog
this morning with mid/high clouds streaming in aloft. The fog is
slow to scatter with locally dense fog mainly Everett north. 33

Previous discussion...High pressure building along the Pacific
coast has allowed for another round of early morning fog and low
stratus, with dense fog locally reducing visibilities to a quarter
mile or less across western Whatcom and Skagit counties. The
upper ridge axis will continue to shift eastward today as a weak
front approaches, allowing for an increase in mid and high level
clouds that will likely limit sun breaks in the afternoon, but may
allow for conditions to improve earlier in the morning today than
days prior. Cloudy skies will stick around this afternoon with
highs peaking on the slightly cool side in the mid 40s across the
lowlands.

A weakening front will move over the region late Tuesday into
early Wednesday morning, bringing little more than light shower
activity mainly along the coast and towards the Canadian border.
While this front will nearly fall apart by the time it reaches
western Washington, it will likely bring in enough forcing to
limit the development of widespread morning fog Wednesday morning.

The high pressure ridge will rebound throughout the day Wednesday
and continue to amplify into Thursday, bringing in continued dry
conditions with potential for more morning fog and low stratus.
Temperatures will warm up a few degrees, peaking near the 50
degree mark across the lowlands on Wednesday and Thursday.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Ensembles and deterministic
forecast models continue to show good agreement over a more
organized frontal system moving over the region on Friday. This
system is on track to bring in lowland rain and mountain snow with
snow levels hovering around 4000 ft alongside breezy conditions.
The mountain passes are favored to see a few inches of snow
accumulation throughout the day Friday with roughly a quarter to
half an inch of rain across the lowlands.

Ensembles then favor high pressure to rebuild along the western US
over the weekend, allowing conditions to dry out once again. There
may be a few shortwaves along the periphery of the ridge for some
brief shower activity, but details remain uncertain at this time
as models favor drier conditions.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper ridge axis over Western Washington this
morning will flatten today and a dissipating frontal system will
move into the area tonight. Light northwest flow aloft will back to
westerly and increase this afternoon. Widespread IFR/LIFR in stratus
(with fog to the north) across the area continues this morning, and
is expected to dissipate mid to late afternoon with increasing high
and mid level moisture/cloud coverage ahead of the incoming weak
frontal system. Ceilings are expected to lower to IFR or low MVFR
across much of the region again late tonight, but light
precipitation will be limited to mainly coastal areas and the
interior from around KPAE northward.

KSEA...IFR or tempo LIFR in stratus expected through midday. While
an eventual scattering of the low cloud layer is expected mid to
late afternoon, timing confidence still remains low. General
thinking is that the stratus deck will break up 21Z-00Z as higher
cloud decks thicken up ahead of the weak incoming front. A few
showers may develop in the vicinity of the terminal 06Z-12Z tonight,
but most precip is expected to remain north. Ceilings are expected
to deteriorate again tonight, but confidence in exact ceiling height
is low. Best estimate is for ceilings to drop to IFR threshold by
12Z Wednesday. Surface winds light east/northeasterly this morning
will become southerly 4 to 7 knots this afternoon and evening.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A front will dissipate over the offshore and outer
coastal waters this afternoon and evening as strong surface
ridging centered over southern British Columbia and northeast
Washington gradually shifts eastward. Small craft advisories for
the coastal waters and the west entrance to the strait have been
extended for a combination of easterlies and/or seas near the 10
foot threshold. Quieter conditions return Wednesday into Thursday as
surface ridging rebuilds offshore then shifts inland. A somewhat
stronger front will reach the area Thursday night into Friday and
will likely generate some headlines for much of the area waters.
Broad surface ridging rebuilds offshore over the weekend.

Coastal seas will nudge 10 feet over the outer coastal waters later
today into early Tuesday before subsiding once again. They`ll jump
back into the 10-14 foot range with the late week front.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
