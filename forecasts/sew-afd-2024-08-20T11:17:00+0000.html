Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cool and showery conditions today with a low pressure
system moving inland. Isolated thunderstorms are possible from
west to east as this system moves through. A stronger system
brings additional moisture, thunderstorm chances, and cool
temperatures later in the week. Showers continue into the weekend
with a shift to drier and slightly warmer conditions early next
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Latest NWS radar imagery
depicts several bands of precipitation spreading onshore across
the region, rotating broadly around the parent low that has
remained offshore for the last day or so. Guidance continues to
suggest this low will finally push onshore through the day, with
the southerly flow bringing moisture and the colder air aloft
steepening lapse rates. This will maintain plenty of showers and
perhaps a few isolated thunderstorms as the low tracks eastward
today. The main threats will be brief downpours, lightning, and
small hail, along with gusty winds. As the colder air moves in
behind the front, expect temperatures to largely trend some 5 to
10 degrees cooler than yesterday. The next low dropping from the
Gulf of Alaska will quickly slide down the Pacific coast from
near southern Vancouver Island Wednesday to the Oregon/California
border by late Thursday. Additional showers and isolated thunderstorms
remain possible as this system moves by, and temperatures will
remain cooler than normal.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Expect the low well to the
south to slide eastward into the Great Basin, providing for some
slightly rising heights over the region. However, a few embedded
disturbances likely provide the focus for more rain at times into
the first half of the weekend. Ensemble guidance then slightly
favors a shift back to a warmer and drier pattern for the early
portions of next week. However, still plenty of variability in
potential outcomes and confidence in the specifics remains lower
for the weekend and beyond at this point.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low situated offshore will push inland
today, allowing for south/southwesterly flow aloft to become more
westerly by this evening. Radar shows showers moving across the
Olympic Peninsula early this morning. Expect showers to continue
pushing inland through the morning and to persist through the
day. Isolated thunderstorms will also be possible throughout the
day, however confidence at this time is too low to include in the
TAFs. Ceilings generally VFR across the interior this morning,
with MVFR along the coast in showers. Expect more widespread MVFR
ceilings to develop between 13-16Z and to persist into the
afternoon. Ceilings may lift back to VFR by mid to late afternoon.
Winds primarily S/SW at 5-10 kt.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings will persist into the afternoon hours,
generally lifting between 18-21Z. Showers will persist within the
vicinity of the terminal through the day and isolated thunderstorms
will be possible. Winds will generally persist from the S/SW at 5-10
kt and may be gusty in showers. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure offshore will gradually weaken today and
push inland. Winds 10-20 kt over the coastal waters will
gradually ease through the day today. Isolated thunderstorms will
be possible throughout the day today and could bring gusty winds
and low visibilities to portions of the area waters at times.
Another low will drop down into the region mid to late week and
bring a weak front to the coastal waters. Additional systems will
move into the area waters over the weekend, bringing increased
onshore flow to the area and the potential for stronger westerly
pushes through the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Wave heights will
generally range between 3-6 ft over the next several days. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
