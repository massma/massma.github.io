Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
131 PM EDT Mon Oct 23 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure builds in from the west through tonight. The high
then gradually builds offshore Tuesday and remains over the
Western Atlantic through the week. A weak cold front approaches
from the west by Saturday and moves through Saturday night into
Sunday morning.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
Forecast on track this afternoon with high pressure continuing
to build in from the Ohio Valley. A weakening pressure gradient
will lead to weaker gusts than Sunday, but could still see
occasional gusts around 20 mph this afternoon near the coast.
Winds will then diminish towards early evening. Highs range in
the upper 50s to around 60 degrees.

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
For tonight, high pressure moves overhead but with weak
shortwave aloft moving in and weakening ridging late, clouds
will increase. Winds however will continue to diminish and
become calm. Radiational cooling will occur but will not be the
most optimal with the clouds increasing late.

With some inconsistent trends over the last 24 hours, the low
temperature forecast has fluctuated as well as the frost
forecast for tonight. Much of the forecast lows are in the mid
30s to mid 40s. Forecast lows are in the upper 40s for NYC and
in the lower 30s for parts of Orange County. Cloud coverage has
exhibited a wide variance in the model forecast with some such
as the GFS, NAM and HRRR indicating mostly cloudy conditions
overnight into Tuesday morning.

Preference considering the uncertainty is to hold off on frost
advisory with this forecast package since confidence is lower on
this frost occurring. Still put in the forecast patchy and some
small areas of frost forming overnight, mainly across parts of
the interior to the north and west of NYC. Some locations with a
relatively higher chance to have frost formation include Orange
NY, Putnam NY, and parts of interior southern CT. Due to higher
cloud coverage, went more patchy with frost formation as opposed
to larger areas of frost. Overall confidence in frost low enough
to decide to hold off on issuing frost advisories.

Aloft, ridging resumes Tuesday. With mid level negative
vorticity advection behind the weak shortwave, clouds will
decrease. At the surface, high pressure will build more
southeast of the region. More SW winds develop in response. Warm
air advection is forecast. Went slightly higher than
MAV/MET/NBM combination with highs reaching more into the 60s.

The warming trend continues thereafter with lows Tuesday night
and Wednesday night getting relatively warmer than those of the
previous night. The daytime high temperatures forecast for
Wednesday were taken from the NBM which is leaning towards the
upper percentiles for the high temperature forecast, ranging
from the mid 60s to lower 70s. Low temperatures forecast Tuesday
night are in the mid 30s to low 50s and for Wednesday night are
in the low to upper 50s.

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
Tranquil continues for Thursday onward as high pressure remains
offshore through the end of the week. With a continued southerly
flow, temperatures through the week are expected to be well above
normal.

Global guidance is coming into better agreement with a cold front
that is forecast to slowly approach the area from the mid-West on
Saturday. This front will move through Saturday night into Sunday
morning. However, the cold front looks to be week, and only light
amounts of rain are expected with it, with some solutions bringing
it through dry or mainly dry.

The SCA on the ocean waters has been allowed to expire.
Conditions will remain below SCA levels through the rest of the
