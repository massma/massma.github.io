Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
504 AM EDT Fri Aug 9 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A warm front will lift north of the area this morning, while
post-tropical depression Debby lifts north across the Appalachians,
interacting with an approaching cold front. The low will pass
well west of the area today and then to the north tonight, sending
a strong front through the area tonight into Saturday morning.
Broad low pressure will remain to the north from Saturday night
into the middle of next week, with high pressure off to the west,
and only a few weak surface troughs or cold frontal passages.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Warm front has lifted north across LI and NYC and will do so
across the remainder of the area the next few hours. Much of the
shower activity is limited to the Hudson Valley and CT, north
of the warm front. Warm precipitation processes in a tropical
airmass are allowing for heavier pockets with max rates around
.50"/hour. As the morning progresses, much of the shower
activity will lift north of the area with the best thermal
forcing. However, the strengthening southerly flow to the east
of Post-tropical depression Debby will allow for upslope and
possible showers and isolated thunderstorms to continue, but
mainly across the Lower Hudson Valley. To the east, dry air in
the mid levels will keep coastal areas mainly rain-free to start
the day, barring some spotty activity.

At the same time, a large upper vortex across the Great Lakes
will send a strong cold front eastward. Moisture from Debby and
instability will allow for a band of heavy rain producing
showers and thunderstorms to work east and into far western
areas by late this afternoon, then working east through the
night, exiting far eastern LI and SE CT by daybreak. Trend over
the last few days have been for a faster system and less rainfall.
We are now looking at about half an inch across NYC and LI, with
amounts of 1 to possibly 2 inches to the north and west. Western
portions of Orange County NY and western Passaic could see amounts
closer to 2 inches. PWAT values will be at near all-time level
of around 2.50". Thus, localized higher amounts are possible,
but storms will track quickly south to north along the front and
pre-frontal trough, which will be steadily moving east. The
progressive nature of the system will spare the area much higher
rainfall amounts that looked possible earlier this week. WPC
has ares north and west of NYC in slight risk for excessive
rainfall, with a marginal risk to the east. There is a small
portion from Port Jervis west that is a moderate risk.

As for the severe weather threat, this is very much a tropical
airmass with skinny CAPE (mainly 500-1000 J/KG) and increasing
deep-layer shear. Hodographs across the area show helicity
values increasing to 200-300 m2/s2 by this afternoon across the
Lower Hudson Valley and NE NJ, with lower values to the east
(mainly due to weaker shear vectors and smaller hodographs areas).
Thus, there is a local threat for brief tornadoes with mini
supercell development (low-topped convection). Latest CAMs do
show weakening of the convection as it works toward coastal
area tonight, partly due to the weaker shear and decreasing
instability.

There is also a wind advisory for coastal locations with mixed
layer winds showing the potential of mixing down 40 kt (46 mph)
gusts to the surface this afternoon into this evening. 00Z HRRR
max gust potential showing about 45 kt. There is a chance that
some of these gusts push farther inland, but confidence is
lower. Wind Advisory may also need to shortened later for
eastern areas as the core of the LLJ passes to the east by early
morning.

It will be warm and muggy with temperatures in the upper 70s to
lower 80s with dew points well into the 70s. In fact, there
are heat indices around 90 at the coast this afternoon.
Overnight lows will be in the upper 60s to lower 70s with some
drier air arriving behind the front late.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A westerly flow on Saturday will bring in a significantly drier
air mass into the region. Cold advection lags behind the front
and the airmass should heat up nicely into the lower and mid
80s. Dew points will be falling through the 60s. Dry conditions
with seasonable temperatures will be on tap for Saturday night.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
A mainly dry period is expected, with plenty of sunshine, and near
to slightly below normal temperatures late this weekend into early
next week as a broad upper trough lingers over the Northeast. The
trough begins to pull out during mid week, with temps rising to a
little above normal by Wed-Thu.

A few surface troughs or weak cold frontal passages are possible
through the middle of next week. The current pattern will hold
tropical air south of the area, with dewpoints in the upper 50s and
lower 60s. With low moisture and weak lift, most of these surface
trough/weak cold frontal passages should be mainly dry, with no
more than 10 or 20 PoP.

&&

.AVIATION /08Z FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A warm front will lift north of the terminals this morning. A strong
cold front approaches this afternoon and moves across this evening
into early Saturday morning.

The warm front is beginning to lift north of NYC metro and Long
Island terminals with flight categories likely to slowly improve to
IFR through day break. Widespread LIFR expected elsewhere to start
early this morning. Showers are also expected with the most
widespread coverage from around the NYC metro terminals on NW.
Showers coverage should diminish towards middle morning, but a few
showers remain possible into the afternoon.

Ceilings should also improve to MVFR late this morning into the
afternoon with a chance for a brief period of VFR near the coast.
Conditions should then fall back to IFR late this afternoon into the
evening as a more widespread band of showers and possible
thunderstorms moves into the region from the west. Heavy rainfall
and gusty winds are possible in any shower/storm. Showers will
likely continue into the overnight with conditions remaining IFR
with potential of local LIFR. Gradual improving conditions expected
late tonight into early Saturday morning.

E-NE winds will continue shifting to the SE and increase this
morning. A few gusts to 20 kt are possible, especially near the
coast and towards day break. SE winds become 15-20g25-30kt,
strongest near the coast. S-SE gusts 35-40 kt are possible in the
afternoon and evening, especially for NYC metro and Long Island
terminals. Winds will shift to the SW and then W tonight as the
front pushes to the east. Wind speeds will gradually diminish behind
the front.

LLWS is likely late afternoon into the evening with winds at 2kft
around 50 kt.

...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Amendments expected for changing flight categories through this
evening. Conditions could improve to MVFR several hours quicker than
forecast this morning and there is a chance for VFR late morning
into the afternoon.

Low chance for thunderstorms 09-13z.

Timing of band of showers and embedded thunderstorms this evening
may be off by 1-3 hours.

Peak gusts around 40 kt possible 18-00z.

OUTLOOK FOR 06Z SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...

Late Tonight: Gradual improvement to VFR with IFR likely lingering
across eastern Long Island and southeast Connecticut.  Showers
tapering off from west to east.

Saturday-Tuesday: VFR.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>As post-tropical depression Debby passes to the west today along
with an approaching cold front, southerly winds will steadily
increase this morning with gale force gusts possible by late
morning, continuing into the night. Gales could come down
sooner tonight with an inversion setting up and the LLJ passing
to the east. Seas on the ocean will build to 8 to 10 ft by this
evening, with 3 to 6 ft across Long Island Sound. Once the gale
warning ends small craft conditions linger into Saturday
morning on the non ocean waters, and on the ocean into Saturday
night as seas remain elevated. Otherwise, quiet cond should
prevail from then into Tue night, with generally light winds.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Isolated to scattered flash flooding will be possible later
today into early Saturday morning. Rainfall rates of 1 inch per
hour during the heaviest rain is likely, with rates as high as
2 inches per hour in localized areas. The best chance to see
these higher hourly rates will be across the Lower Hudson
Valley. Rapid responding small stream flooding and urban/poor
drainage flooding will be possible given antecedent rains/saturated
grounds. The overall higher chances for flooding will be across
northeastern New Jersey, into the lower Hudson Valley where WPC
maintains a slight risk of flash flooding. The remainder of the
area is in a marginal risk for flash flooding with mainly poor
drainage and urban flooding is possible. Rainfall amounts will
range from around half an inch across LI and the NYC metro
(downward trend), to 1 to 2 inches north and west.

There are no hydrologic concerns from Sat night into mid next
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>There is a high risk for rip currents today through Saturday
evening as breaking surf builds to 4 to 11 feet by mid day
Friday and remains at least 7 feet into midday Saturday. A high
surf advisory remains in effect from noon EDT today through
noon EDT Saturday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
