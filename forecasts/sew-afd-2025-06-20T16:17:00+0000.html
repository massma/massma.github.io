Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
917 AM PDT Fri Jun 20 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Wet and cooler weather is in store for today and
Saturday as an upper level low moves overhead. Mountain snow is
expected at elevations above 5000 ft through Saturday. Warm and
dry conditions return early next week.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No significant changes to the
forecast this morning. The previous discussion can be found below
along with updates to the aviation section.

A large upper level low centered off the British Columbia coast
is beginning to track down towards western Washington this
morning. This system will be centered over our area by Friday
afternoon before slowly drifting off to the southeast Saturday
into Sunday. At the surface, shower chances will increase this
morning, though the bulk of the precipitation is expected to fall
late tonight into Saturday morning as additional moisture wraps
around from the north. Shower chance will begin to taper off
Saturday night, through a few showers may remain in the mountains
on Sunday. Through Saturday, total rainfall ranges from around
0.25 to 0.5 inches in the lowlands, with around 0.5-1.0 inches
expected in the mountains.

With the coldest air aloft overhead Friday afternoon, the
atmospheric profile will become unstable, allowing for the
possibility of thunderstorms, best chances being in southwest WA.
Around 200-300 J/kg of CAPE is forecast from areas south and west
of Tacoma, including the Southwest Interior. The primary impacts
from any thunderstorms that do develop will be heavy downpours,
lightning, as well as some small hail or graupel.

High temperatures today and Saturday will be around 10 degrees
below average, in the upper 50s to low 60s. As the system departs
Sunday, conditions look to dry out and we may see some afternoon
clearing, which will allow highs to return to near normal--in the
60s along the coast, and around 70 though the interior. Lows will
remain the the 40s to around 50 in the urban corridor.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Broad high pressure
reestablishes itself across the region early next week as the low
departs and heights rise, with weak ridging attempting to form.
Through the interior, temperatures will warm to the mid to upper 70s
on Monday, then, peaking Tuesday as we reach the low to mid 80s.
Highs along the coast remain the 60s with onshore flow. The
pattern gets unclear Wednesday and beyond as several shortwave
troughs look to traverse the Pacific Northwest. This will allow
high temperatures to return back to 70s. In terms of additional
rain chances, NBM does thrown in some slight chance PoPs Wednesday
night into Thursday, through this is still uncertain as plenty of
ensemble members maintain dry conditions through the week. Amounts
will also likely be meager at best (a few hundredths to a few
tenths of an inch possible).
