Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
217 AM PDT Sat Mar 29 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A trough of low pressure over the area will weaken
today allowing showers to diminish across the region into tonight.
A weak ridge of high pressure will provide drier and mild
conditions on Sunday before another trough arrives early in the
coming week with additional chances for showers and a return to
cooler conditions. Drier and somewhat warmer conditions are
expected to return at the end of next week as high pressure
rebuilds into Western Washington.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough
continues to weaken early this morning as it lifts northward into
the British Columbia coast. Shower coverage has noticeably
diminished over the past few hours with most activity along the
coast and over the Olympic Peninsula. Shower chances will linger
across Western Washington today, then we`ll see drier conditions
develop tonight as a weak upper ridge builds into area and the low
level flow turns weakly offshore. Sunday will be a dry and
noticeably mild day for much of the area, but showers associated
the next upper trough offshore will start to spread into coastal
areas and the Southwest Interior by the evening hours. This
activity will lift northward across the area Sunday night into
Monday for cool, showery conditions.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The upper level trough will
continue to wobble offshore into Tuesday as a series of upper
disturbances rotating around it spread showers across the area
and hold temperatures slightly below seasonal norms. Broad upper
troughing remains over the area into the middle of the coming
week for continuing shower chances and slightly below normal
temperatures. Looking beyond that, models continue to exhibit
noteworthy differences. While the ensembles generally agree with
broad upper troughing over the interior Western U.S. moving into
the second half of the coming week, they continue to disagree with
what happens upstream over the Gulf of Alaska and the Pacific
Northwest.

In general, the Euro members favor a more amplified pattern with
a sharp upper trough dropping southward over the region Thursday
followed by a high amplitude ridge folding into the area toward
the end of the week. GFS members lean toward a weak trough on
Thursday followed by weak upper ridging toward Friday. Much of
this detail gets washed out in the forecast which uses the NBM
50th percentile, but the trends still point toward a decreasing
chance of showers by the end of the week and temperatures
rebounding to near normal. And next weekend? It could prove to be
a pleasant one if ensemble trends hold up. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft will become more light westerly
today. An eventual shift towards the SW is favored by the night
however. Mostly VFR currently aside from isolated areas of MVFR.
There`s a window between 12-18z where MVFR cigs may become more
widespread. If manifest VFR is expected to rebound area-wide by the
afternoon. Brief ridging brings drier weather tonight but, residual
surface moisture will likely lead to patchy fog development. Breezy
S-SW surface winds (5-10 kt) switching northerly after 00z Sunday
but generally light in magnitude.

KSEA...VFR cigs so far this morning. Ceilings settling near 3000
feet around 12-16z. HREF probs output around 60-80% for cigs below
3,000 ft for a few hours this morning as well. However, cigs are
forecast to improve by 18z. Southerly winds 5 to 10 kt before
shifting out of the north tonight. Current thinking suggests VFR for
much of the night.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Lighter southerly winds today as a surface low fills and
weakens to our north. Small Craft Advisory winds will continue at
times for eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca before diminishing as the
morning progress. Can`t rule out isolated SCA wind gusts for
neighboring zones as well but not sustained enough for the issuance
of an advisory. Something to monitor though nonetheless. Winds will
transition more east to northeast by Sunday morning as a brief
period of generally benign conditions persists. However, the next
weather system will bring increased southerly winds Sunday night
into Monday with an additional disturbance possible towards midweek
but uncertainty exists at this time.

Seas will subside below 10 feet Saturday. Seas of 4 to 6 feet
expected on Sunday before seas build to near 7 to 9 feet into
Tuesday.

.HYDROLOGY...Showery precipitation will continue through Saturday.
With lower snow levels in the 2500 to 3500 ft range, most area
rivers will see small rises. The exception being the Skokomish
River, which is above flood stage Friday evening. The river will
crest early Saturday morning before slowly receding back under
flood stage later Saturday. With additional chances of rain in
the forecast, the river will remain in at least Action stage
through next week. Uncertainty remains in the QPF next week, but
with the river running high, additional flooding cannot be ruled
out on the Skokomish. Felton/62
