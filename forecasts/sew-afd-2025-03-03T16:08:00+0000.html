Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
808 AM PST Mon Mar 3 2025

.SYNOPSIS...A series of weak troughs will maintain near-normal
temperatures and bring several chances for light showers across
western Washington through mid-week. The pattern may turn more
active next weekend with potential for an atmospheric river to
bring significant precipitation to the Pacific Northwest, but
considerable uncertainty exists at this time.

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A few areas of fog and drizzle showers this morning.
Otherwise a relatively quiet day in store. The current forecast is
on track and no updates are planned.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...A broad upper level trough
over the southwest will continue to move eastward this morning,
being replaced by a brief transitory ridge nudging in tonight into
Tuesday. Latest radar imagery shows a few light scattered showers
over the Puget Sound interior. Light scattered showers will
continue throughout the day on Monday, with the best chances over
the Cascades. Weak convergence today into this evening may locally
enhance precipitation amounts over the central Cascades.

The ridge will build tonight into early Tuesday, allowing for a
brief dry period Tuesday morning. The next upper level trough and
associated surface frontal system will arrive Tuesday afternoon
into Tuesday evening, with showers continuing into Wednesday. This
system will be a bit wetter; a few tenths of an inch of rain will
be possible through the interior, with half an inch up to nearly
an inch over the mountains and along the Pacific coast. With snow
levels near 3000 ft, the Cascade passes will likely see a couple
inches of accumulating snow through Wednesday. Winds will increase
and may become breezy Tuesday night with the low pressure center
not far offshore. The strongest winds will be along the coast and
through the Admiralty Inlet northward, with winds increasing to 15
to 20 mph with gusts up to 35 mph.

Even with cloud cover, these systems will keep the low-level
airmass very moist, allowing for patchy fog to develop in spots
each morning. Fog may be locally dense at times.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Another upper level ridge
will nose into the Pacific Northwest on Thursday, sending the
upper level trough southward. This will allow for a fairly
pleasant day on Thursday, with dry and mostly clear skies after
morning fog evaporates. Clouds will increase once again Friday as
the next system approaches, but models are still hinting at Friday
also being mostly dry across most western Washington, with the
exception being the Pacific coast. Saturday into Sunday, models
continue to show the setup for an atmospheric river to develop and
take aim at the Pacific Northwest. There remains uncertainty in
the exact placement of the main moisture axis, but models are
beginning to converge on it setting up around southern British
Columbia and into northwestern Washington. This would favor
periods of moderate to heavy rainfall over the northwestern
Olympic Peninsula as well as the north Cascades Saturday into
Sunday, with more active weather favored beyond.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level trough moving east this morning with upper
level ridge building into the area this afternoon. Ridge remaining
over the area tonight. Front reaching the area Tuesday. Northerly
flow aloft becoming westerly late this morning and southwesterly
Tuesday. Increasing southeasterly flow in the lower levels Tuesday.

A mix of ceilings this morning ranging from MVFR to IFR/LIFR across
Western Washington. Expecting to see improvement later this
afternoon towards VFR/MVFR and will persist into tonight and Tuesday
morning.

KSEA...Some slight improvement this morning as ceilings have risen
into MVFR. However, light rain/drizzle remains possible through the
morning hours, and it is possible for ceilings to lower back into
IFR/LIFR as a result. Ceilings could improve to VFR in the
afternoon. Southerly wind 4 to 8 knots. Felton/29<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the waters today will weaken
tonight. A front will move through the waters Tuesday. Weak high
pressure will rebuild Wednesday and remain through Thursday.
Another front will approach the waters Friday.

Small craft advisory winds beginning in the outer coastal waters
tonight spreading to the remainder of the coastal waters, entrances
to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Admiralty Inlet and the Northern
Inland Waters Tuesday. Winds easing Tuesday night into Wednesday
morning. Another round of small craft advisory winds for the coast
later Friday into Friday night.

Seas 8 or 9 feet today subsiding a little tonight before building
back up to 9 to 13 feet Tuesday into Tuesday night. Seas 9 to 11
feet Wednesday slowly subsiding Thursday before building again to 8
to 12 ft later Friday and Friday night. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...No river flooding through Friday. Potential wet
system next weekend could push the Skokomish River to flood stage
by late in the weekend. There has been a lot of variability in
the rainfall forecast for the weekend. This situation will be
monitored closely through the week and could certainly change in
the next few days.
