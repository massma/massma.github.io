Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
856 PM PST Fri Nov 8 2024

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Rain has moved onshore along the northern Olympic coast
this evening, and the front will continue to slide eastward into
Saturday. Temperatures on Saturday will be a few degrees cooler,
with highs in the low to mid 50s for the area. No major forecast
updates this evening.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...A slow moving front will cross western WA on Saturday
for a wet period of weather. Active weather will continue into
next week, with more lowland rain, mountain snow, chances of
thunder, high surf and breezy conditions.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Generally quiet across
western WA this afternoon with high clouds and temperatures in the
50s and lower 60s. The next front is stalled offshore and will
slowly shift east and inland overnight into Saturday morning.
Although not particularly strong, this system is wet with
moisture training over the area. Rain-wise, we`re looking at
ranges of 0.25-0.75" across the lowlands through the day.

After a brief break on Sunday, more rain is headed our way Sunday
night into Monday. This is a more beefy system with periods of
moderate to heavy rainfall, especially over the coast, Olympics
and Cascades. Rainfall totals range from 1-2" along the coast with
around 1" in the interior. Rivers will be rising with the
potential for flooding on the Skokomish River in Mason County
(Sunday night). The air mass will be slightly unstable along the
coast with a chance of thunderstorms too. Snow levels will drop in
the north Cascades Monday night with accumulating snowfall above
3500` affecting the higher mountain peaks and passes. 33

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Another strong Pacific storm
system make its way to WA Tuesday night into Wednesday for more
rain, mountain snow, thunderstorms and high surf. The back-to-
back-to-back rainfall will surely keep the rivers running high
with additional rivers creeping up into Action Stage (and possibly
Minor flood stage). Up in the mountains, another round of heavy
snow in the Cascades above 3500` with accumulating snow at the
higher passes like Washington Pass and Stevens Pass. The
thunderstorm threat continues along the coast with isolated
activity possible. In addition, possible high surf along the coast
with swells reaching 14-18 feet (+20 feet over the outer coastal
waters). Troughing offshore keeps the weather unsettled toward
the end of the week with additional showers and mountain snow
showers expected. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow will persist aloft ahead of an
incoming upper level trough. Flow will become more west -
northwesterly Saturday night as the trough pushes off to the east.
Surface winds are generally persisting at 4-8 kt this evening out
of the south/southeast for most terminals. The exception is KHQM,
where winds are more easterly.

A cold front over the coastal waters has started to push rain
inland along the coast this evening. Conditions at area terminals
remain VFR, however. Expect cigs to gradually lower as the frontal
system approaches, but many spots may even stay VFR through the
overnight period. Exceptions will be those spots more prone to
lower cigs such as KPWT, KOLM and KHQM, where MVFR/IFR cigs look
to develop by late tonight and persist through much of Saturday.
Remaining terminals look to dip down into low-end VFR/high-end
MVFR as precip becomes more widespread by the late morning and
early afternoon. Models suggest that MVFR to IFR conditions will
become more prevalent by the afternoon hours with cigs at most
terminals falling within that range. Visibility reductions with
the rainfall can also be expected.

KSEA...VFR conditions prevail this evening, but expect a gradual
lowering of cigs overnight. Cigs look to remain VFR into late
Saturday morning, before lowering down to MVFR. A weak front looks
to arrive between 15-18Z, bringing rain to the terminal. Surface
winds are southerly, persisting at 4-7 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak cold front will push through the area waters
tonight into Saturday. Seas this evening have increased and
generally range between 8-11 ft across the coastal waters this
evening. With inner coastal water buoys already reporting seas of
10 ft tonight, have pushed the timing of the small craft advisories
for the inner coastal waters up to start this evening.

Seas may briefly subside to 7-9 ft Saturday night into Sunday,
however expect this to remain short-lived as seas start to build
back toward 10 ft by Sunday night. A much larger increase is
expected around Monday as a stronger system approaches and brings
a sharp increase in seas over the coastal waters to around 18 to
20 ft.

Seas will not be the only issue, as a strong frontal system will
bring a return of widespread advisory winds Sunday into Monday...with
the potential for some wind gusts meeting gale speeds. Current
guidance suggests around a 40-50% chance over the coastal waters
and around the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca. As such, headlines
are expected to be needed into the start of next week.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weakening frontal system will move through Western
Washington later tonight and Saturday for increasing rain,
although at this time QPF amounts are expected to remain on the
light side. A more significant chance of precipitation is expected
Sunday through Monday, and again on Wednesday as an active
weather pattern returns with weak to potentially moderately strong
atmospheric river events come through the area. The precipitation
amounts will be strongly orographically influenced with
precipitation totals in the mountains expected to be 3 to 5 inches
for both storms except locally over 6 inches on the Olympics for
the last one. The succession of storms will increasingly build up
soil moisture and river levels throughout this period which
increases the possibility for river flooding. Snow levels vary
generally from 4000 to 6000 feet which will impact precipitation
type and affect the amount of storm runoff.

At this time, the Skokomish River is the only river forecasted to
rise into flood stage, and potentially moderate flood stage during
the middle of next week. For other rivers, significant rises are
expected with several river forecast points above Action Stage, and
flooding could be possible, but at this time is not forecasted. The
Hydrologic Ensemble Prediction System (HEFS), though typically too
low of probabilities for any one time point, has some elevated
probabilities for the 10 day period. For example, it has a 51%
chance for minor flooding for the Snoqualmie River near Carnation.
Flooding extent will depend on rainfall rates, temperatures, as well
as snow levels with precipitation that falls with each of these
weather systems next week. We will continue to assess the hydrologic
conditions and forecasts for any additional areas of potential
flooding.
