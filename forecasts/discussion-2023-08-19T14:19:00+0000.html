.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure builds across the region today and pushes offshore
tonight. A cold front approaches Monday and moves through Monday
night. High pressure will return for Tuesday through Wednesday,
then depart on Thursday. A frontal system may approach Thursday
night and Friday.

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The forecast is on track. High pressure builds eastward from
the Ohio River Valley today, resulting in dry weather
conditions. The cyclonic flow and a pool of cool air aloft
should allow for the development of diurnal cu, especially
across the lower Hudson Valley and southern CT, with mostly
sunny skies elsewhere.

Temperatures will struggle to reach 80 today. Most top out in
the mid to upper 70s in the afternoon, Humidity levels will be
relatively low for this time of year with dew points in the 50s
region-wide.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

Dry conditions continue through Monday. With mainly clear skies

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
As a cold front sinks south, NW flow aloft on the ern periphery

75-80, with lows from the mid 50s inland to the 60s in the metro

The air mass will moderate slightly Thu night/Fri as the sfc high
moves east, with lows from the lower 60s inland to mid/upper 60s
metro/coast, highs from the upper 70s to mid 80s, both near to
