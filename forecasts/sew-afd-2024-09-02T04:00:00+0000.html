Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
900 PM PDT Sun Sep 1 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An incoming shortwave trough will bring a return to
onshore flow and cooler temperatures on Monday, as well as a few
isolated showers and thunderstorms over the Cascades. A ridge will
rebuild over the area midweek for a return to dry and warmer
conditions.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak disturbance
lifting north is bringing some light rain showers to far southern
and eastern portions of the area this evening. Much of this will
likely evaporate as virga with moisture generally limited.
Otherwise, forecast remains on track this evening with previous
short/long term sections following.

This will bring a deeper marine push into most of western
Washington, bringing a return to cooler and more moist air. High
temperatures on Labor day will be in the mid 60s along the coast
to low 70s across the interior with skies remaining at least
partly cloudy all day. Cooler air aloft as the trough moves
through will bring a slight chance for isolated showers and
thunderstorms over the Cascades Monday morning and into Monday
afternoon. Any thunderstorms that are able to develop should be
short-lived but a few lightning strikes cannot be ruled out.

Tuesday looks to remain cool, though perhaps a touch warmer for
some, as the trough ejects eastward and a ridge begins to move
into the region and build, allowing for clouds to scour out
earlier in the day. Wednesday will be the first day of a return to
significant warmth across the region, with some locations` high
temperatures Wednesday reaching 10-15 degrees higher compared to
Tuesday. Additionally, low level flow will begin to turn back
offshore as the surface thermal trough redevelops along the coast,
which will further reinforce the warming and drying effects.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...The ridge axis will pass
over the region late Wednesday into Thursday, with Thursday
expected to be the warmest day with temperatures in the mid 80s
to mid 90s going into Lewis County and the Cascade valleys. A
developing shortwave moving into California on Friday into
Saturday looks to interrupt and deamplify the ridge, allowing
temperature to back off a bit into the 80s. Ensemble guidance
continues to favor warm and dry conditions and above normal
temperatures, through a gentle cooling trend, through next
weekend.

.AVIATION...Western Washington will remain on the back side of an
upper level ridge tonight. An upper level low off the southern
Oregon coast will move inland on Monday. Southerly flow will
persist aloft into Monday, becoming more westerly by Monday
afternoon. Onshore flow will increase tonight in the low levels as
a thermally induced trough pushes inland.

Conditions generally VFR across the majority of the TAF sites this
afternoon with satellite imagery showing some more more mid to
high level cloud cover streaming north into the region. The
exception is KHQM, which remains MVFR to IFR in stratus along the
coast. Expect stratus to push into the interior overnight,
generally between 09-12Z. Stratus will bring periods of IFR
conditions for terminals across the interior at times through the
morning. Expect stratus to stick around through the day, but to
lift towards MVFR by the late morning hours and towards VFR
through the afternoon. Northerly surface winds persisting at 4-8
kt this afternoon across the interior terminals will transition to
southerly by 06Z tonight and persist at 4-8 kt in Monday morning.

KSEA...VFR conditions with some mid to high level cloud cover
streaming overhead. Northwest winds 4-8 kt will transition to
southerly by 06Z. Marine stratus expected to move into the
terminal between 09-12Z and to bring ceilings down to IFR at
times through Monday morning. Ceilings look to lift to MVFR near
18Z and towards VFR around 21Z. 14

.MARINE...Onshore flow will increase tonight as a thermally induced
trough continues to push inland. Sustained westerly winds along
the central and eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca will increase to
10-20 kt by this evening, though frequent gusts to 25 kt are
expected. The onshore flow will pattern continue through Tuesday,
with another surge of westerly winds expected along the Strait
during the Monday night into Tuesday. A thermal trough then looks
to gradually extend northward along the coast Wednesday into
Thursday for a transition to offshore flow.

Seas will generally persist at 3-6 ft tonight across the coastal
waters, though look to build towards 7 ft across the outer
coastal waters on Monday. Seas will then subside again towards 3-5
ft by Tuesday and persist at this range through midweek, before
building closer to 7 again on Thursday. 14

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...A return to onshore flow tonight will allow for a
return of cooler and moist air to western Washington, thus
allowing the current Red Flag Warning to expire this afternoon.

With fuels continuing to rapidly dry across the
region, the chance for isolated thunderstorms over the Cascades
will have to be monitored for lightning strikes. While storms are
not expected to be widespread enough for Red Flag conditions, with
the little amount of precipitation expected in these storms, the
potential exists for new fire starts.

Looking forward to next week, warm and dry conditions look to
return Wednesday into Thursday over the Cascades as an upper
level ridge builds back over the region and a return to weak
easterly flow over the Cascades. This may mark the next period of
elevated to near-critical fire weather conditions, particularly
over the central Cascades.
