Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
110 AM EST Tue Jan 30 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure builds in from the north through Tuesday and
weakens over the local region Wednesday through Wednesday
night. A cold front approaches from the north and west Thursday.
This front moves in Thursday night into early Friday. High
pressure then builds in from SE Canada thereafter through early
Saturday. The center of the high pressure area remains in
Southeast Canada for the weekend as low pressure strengthens in
the Canadian Maritimes. High pressure builds more into the area
going into early next week.

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM THIS MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Very few adjustments made with this update. Mainly just
accounted for light snow / flurry activity to dissipate and
remain further east for the next few hours. Otherwise,
predominantly dry with clouds remaining overnight. Previously
the minimum temperature forecast was raised by about 3-5
degrees in most spots away from NYC metro. Lows overnight
mostly 25-30 inland and 30-35 at the coast. Winds will continue
to diminish overnight as the pressure gradient weakens over the
region while a high pressure ridge builds in.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM THIS MORNING THROUGH 6 PM WEDNESDAY/...
High pressure will build to our north through the day on Tuesday
keeping us dry. Cloud cover may remain on the high side Tuesday and
Tuesday night and the low will have more easterly component than
northerly due to the placement of high pressure to our north and as
a nearby shortwave in the Great Lakes moves towards the Tennessee
Valley, spilling some higher clouds our way. This shortwave will be
too far away to bring any precipitation Tuesday evening or night.

With a seasonably cold air mass firmly in place and some clouds,
look for temperatures to remain the 30s on Tuesday. More sun will be
seen across northeastern sections, in closer proximity to high
pressure in the morning and early afternoon before high clouds spill
in from the west in the late afternoon and evening.

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
High pressure weakens across the local area Wednesday into
Wednesday night. A cold front approaches Thursday from the north
and west and moves through Thursday night into early Friday. The
low associated with this cold front strengthens and eventually
moves into the Canadian Maritimes this weekend with the center
of high pressure staying in Southeast Canada. The high pressure
area builds more into the local region going into early next
week.

Overall, not too much precipitation in the long term as two low
pressure systems pass well south of the region. One passes off
the coast of the Carolinas Wednesday into Wednesday night.
Another low passes well south of the region early next week.

Temperatures exhibit no significant departures from normal for
most days. Thursday and Thursday night feature temperatures that
are close to 10 degrees above seasonal normal values for this
time of year with more west to southwest flow.

The overall mid and upper level pattern shown amongst the numerical
weather prediction models convey a series of lesser amplitude
troughs traversing the region during the long term. The upper
jet streaks stay well south of the area and the Pacific jet into
Southern US appears much stronger going through this week. There
is a less active synoptic pattern in the local area.

The precipitation in the long term period appears to be confined to
Thursday night through Friday time window, when a cold front
traverses the region. Rain and snow showers will be possible but
will stay light. Ensembles depict much less probability for a
tenth of an inch or more of precipitation compared to a
hundredth of an inch or more of precipitation. Overall,
precipitation looks likely to remain below a tenth of an inch.

Teleconnections with AO and NAO depict from GEFS declines in early
February but NAO appears to be getting near neutral.

850mb temperatures from the numerical weather prediction models
stay above -10 degrees C during the long term but may get near
that value late Sunday night and Monday according to some
models.

.AVIATION /06Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure slowly remains in control through the TAF period.

Cigs varying btwn 2500-3500ft through tonight.

Northerly winds around 10kt or less veering to NE towards the
morning push. The winds veer to the E late this morning, then
ESE this afternoon into tonight, remaining under 10kt.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Amendments may be need to refine MVFR/VFR cig fluctuations
through Wed AM push, with higher likelihood for cigs to average
MVFR than VFR.

OUTLOOK FOR 06Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

Late tonight and Wednesday: MVFR likely for western terminals,
MVFR/VFR for eastern terminals. E/SE winds less than 10 kt.

Wednesday Night through Thursday: VFR. SW winds.

Thursday Night and Friday: Chance of MVFR or lower conditions
in rain or a rain/snow shower mix. SW winds Thu Night shifting
NW Fri.

Saturday: VFR.

forecasts, can be found at: https:/www.weather.gov/zny/n90<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Winds continue to diminish. Below SCA conditions are present
across the non-ocean waters. Ocean waters will remain under a
SCA through tonight into the day Tuesday due to higher seas at
5-6 feet with an easterly swell. Waves will drop below 5 feet
Tuesday night.

Pressure gradient remains relatively relaxed enough to keep
conditions below SCA thresholds on the forecast waters Wednesday
through Friday. The pressure gradient tightens behind a cold
front Friday night and into the weekend as associated low
pressure strengthens in the Canadian Maritimes. SCA wind gusts
are forecast to develop on the ocean and South Shore Bays with
possible SCA wind gusts on other forecast waters as well. Seas
are forecast to remain below SCA thresholds but could trend
higher into low end SCA levels for the weekend on the ocean in
subsequent forecasts.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...
No hydrologic impacts are expected this week.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
Potential for localized minor coastal flooding with tonight and/or
Tue morning high tide cycles along the western Sound and in the
southern Nassau bays.

Generally 2 1/2 ft of surge is needed for minor coastal flooding.
