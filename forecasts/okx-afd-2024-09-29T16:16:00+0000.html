Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
1216 PM EDT Sun Sep 29 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A stationary front remains south of the area while high
pressure noses in from the northeast into Tuesday. Low pressure
passes south of the area Tuesday into Wednesday. A cold front
passes through Wednesday, followed by high pressure through
Saturday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Still seeing enough low level moisture convergence over the NYC
metro to start the afternoon for light rain/drizzle. There has
been some erosion of the north edge of the rain shield and this
should slowly continue through the rest of the afternoon as
drier air begins to move in from the north and east. Adjusted
PoPs accordingly to account for the latest trends. Elsewhere,
it should be mostly dry for the rest of the afternoon/evening,
but a pocket of light rain or sprinkles remains possible.

Drier air will continue to erode away the low level moisture
with any lingering light rain/drizzle ending early this evening.
A subsidence inversion around 800-850 mb may help linger a
thinner layer of moisture leading to a continuation of mostly
cloudy skies overnight.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...
High pressure remains nosing in from the northeast while low
pressure passes to our south during the short term period. With high
pressure more established over the area on Monday, we will
likely be dry. The next chance of PoPs will be late Monday night
through Tuesday with low pressure passing to our south. The PoP
forecast for this has trended down and decided to go lower than
the NBM. The global models keep the northern edge of rain
offshore to our south. This will depend on strength of the high
to our north and exact track of the low. Either way at this time
no hydrologic impacts are expected.

Stuck close to NBM for temps during this period.

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
Relatively tame pattern sets up mid to late week. Weak high pressure
briefly builds in behind the exiting offshore low Wednesday as a
trough digs over the Upper Great Lakes. This will send a cold front
toward the region, passing through by Wednesday evening. Best
forcing appears well to the north, and moisture will be limited, so
not anticipating much in the way of impacts from the fropa, perhaps
a few showers ahead of the boundary Wed evening across the northern
interior. More likely, the front moves through dry, with clearing
skies into Thursday as high pressure quickly rebuilds behind it. The
high slips offshore by Friday, but ridging remains in place to start
the upcoming weekend. Another cold front may approach Saturday, but
global ensembles once again keep this weak locally, with potentially
little impact.

Temperatures remain near to just above normal for early autumn.
Afternoon highs generally range from the upper 60s to mid 70s, with
morning lows into the 40s and 50s. The national blend was followed
for this update.

&&

.AVIATION /16Z SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
A stationary front remains south of the region through tonight.

Generally MVFR, with local IFR, much of the day, with
fluctuations between MVFR and IFR possible this morning.
Otherwise, by this afternoon MVFR is expected to prevail.
Light rain continues in the NYC metro area, with changes
decreasing this afternoon, however, a chance does remain into
this evening. Improvement to VFR possible by early evening,
becoming likely tonight.

ENE flow near 10 kt today, with occasional 15 to 20 kt gusts
possible along the coast. Similar flow and speeds expected on
Monday.

NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Amendments likely today with changing flight categories.

Occasional gusts to near 20 kt possible this afternoon.

Timing of improvement to VFR may be off by a couple of hours.

OUTLOOK FOR 12Z MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...

Monday: Mainly VFR. Chance of rain late Monday into Monday night
with MVFR.

Tuesday: MVFR/IFR with a chance of rain. ENE wind gusts 15-20 kt,
diminishing at night.

Wednesday: Mainly VFR. Slight chance of rain.

Thursday: VFR.

.MARINE...
A Small Craft Advisory remains in effect through early this
evening for the west of Moriches Inlet and until 2 pm east of
there. A persistent easterly flow continues today, but will
slowly weaken heading into the afternoon. Seas over the ocean
are currently 5-6 feet and will slowly lower through the day.

Sub Small Craft Advisory criteria is then expected tonight through
Monday night before 5 ft waves could return to the ocean on
Tuesday. Elevated seas then persist thru Wednesday on the ocean
with lingering ESE swell. Seas are forecast to lower below 5 ft
Wed night, and sub SCA conditions are then expected on all
coastal waters thereafter.
