Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
853 PM PST Tue Dec 31 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A weak system will move through the region tonight
bringing precipitation back to the region. Some isolated areas of
a rain-snow mix or a brief period of snow are possible on higher
hills and around the Hood Canal. Otherwise little impact is
expected. Breezy easterly winds will develop in the Cascades and
along the Pacific coast with a system offshore Thursday into
Friday. Additional rounds of precipitation are possible through
Sunday before drier conditions become favored next week.

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Radar is showing a couple outer bands of precipitation
reaching Puget Sound this evening (with the main line coming
onshore down at Ocean Shores as of 740 PM this evening ahead of
the occluded front). Hi-res guidance has the heaviest of the
showers remaining along the coast, with the inland showers
trickling back in the first few hours of 2025. Dewpoints/temperatures
in the Hood Canal area (around Brinnon) are still at 38 degrees,
but not too far above are some freezing temperatures (so will
continue to see the chance of wintry precipitation up in areas
such as Lake Cushman). Additional details of the forecast can be
found below.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weakening wave
and associated frontal system will move through the region
overnight bringing areas of precipitation back to the region. The
most noteworthy aspect of the evolution overnight will be some
cooler air anchored in the Hood Canal area south towards the Back
Hills between Olympia and Elma. The combination of wet bulb
effects and this cooler air may result in a period of a rain-snow
mix or brief periods of snow overnight into early Wednesday
morning. With relatively warm ground temperatures and overnight
lows generally in the mid-30s, accumulations are unlikely in most
areas. However, isolated and short-lived accumulations up to
around an inch are possible, mainly in the Hood Canal area and the
Black Hills (including Highway 8 between Olympia and McCleary).
Probabilities of 1 inch of snow peak at around 50% on Highway 8
and then fall down to around 10-20% near Shelton, Skokomish, and
Hoodsport. Accumulations on the order of 1-4 inches are possible
at higher elevations around Lake Cushman where overnight low
temperatures will be around freezing. Further east the airmass
will be slightly less favorable but a rain-snow mix will still be
possible on some of the higher hills (above ~500 feet) and
foothill valleys within the western Washington lowlands.
Precipitation will taper off through the day Wednesday.

Brief ridging will move across the area early Thursday. However,
the break will be short-lived as the next upper level wave
approaches the area Thursday and Friday and accompanying surface
lows spin off the Pacific Coast. This will bring not only
increased precipitation chances to the region but will also
increase the surface gradients, increasing easterly flow over the
area. Wind gusts generally in the 15-25 mph are expected Thursday
and Friday, however there could be a peak up to around 35-40 mph
Friday morning. There is a ~10% chance of gusts up to near 50 mph
Friday morning with the strongest solutions.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH TUESDAY/...The upper level
system will bring widespread precipitation late Friday through
Saturday followed by a secondary wave that will move through on
Sunday. These systems will be relatively quick hitting, and likely
insufficient to cause an flooding concerns.

Ridging just off the west coast is strongly favored to amplify
early next week. However, looking at the cluster analysis, there
are differences in the position, strength, and potential tilt of
this ridge which will have implications on the forecast. In
general, drier (not necessarily dry) and warmer than average
January weather will be favored, and the CPC 8-14 day outlook
supports this lingering into the week-2 time frame.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft tonight become more westerly
Wednesday.  VFR conditions this evening will become MVFR area wide
tonight with light rain spreading in from the SW. LIFR conditions
possible with low stratus/fog mainly through the interior south of
Puget Sound. Patchy fog will lift into the afternoon as mid to high
level clouds track overhead. Tonight, an occluded front will bring
widespread rain and showers to W WA along with lower ceilings. MVFR
cigs are favored to become more widespread by early Wednesday
morning and remain before improvement is met during the afternoon.


KSEA...VFR conditions with light rain this evening. The chance for
MVFR cigs will pick up traction around 10-14z. HREF guidance has a
70-90% chance of cigs being below 3,000 ft through Wednesday morning
before any improvement to VFR is met in the afternoon. E to SE winds
throughout most of the period remaining generally 4-8 kts. Winds
then turn SSW later Wednesday morning.

.MARINE...Surface high pressure progressing east of the Cascades
will open the door for the next disturbance. An occluded surface low
just offshore of Haida Gwaii will drag a front into area waters
tonight. SCA winds over the coast will blow into the early morning
hours. Elsewhere, waters should remain benign but there is a window
of SCA winds/gusts over the East Strait tonight into early Wednesday
morning.

Seas 5-7 ft increasing to 7-9 ft tonight, holding there through
Wednesday which will bring another rise to 9-11 ft. This has the
potential to yield more SCA conditions due to high seas for the
coastal waters. A sub 1000 mb low is expected to move over the
coastal waters on Friday, bringing another chance of small craft
criteria winds and waves between 8 to 12 ft. Waves should decrease
below 10 ft on Sunday night.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The active weather pattern will promote several
rounds of lowland rain across western Washington though the week
and into this weekend. Snow levels look to increase up to 4000 to
5000 ft beginning late Thursday through the weekend over the
Olympic Peninsula. Each of these systems are fairly progressive,
limiting the total rainfall accumulation with each system. No
river flooding is currently forecast, through the Skokomish River
looks to remain in action stage, getting closer to flood stage
early on Saturday following the warmer system on Friday.
