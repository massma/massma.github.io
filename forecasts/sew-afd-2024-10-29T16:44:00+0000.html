Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
944 AM PDT Tue Oct 29 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showers lingering over the Cascades today but come to
an end over the lowlands later this afternoon. Another frontal
system will move through Wednesday for breezy winds, lowland rain,
and mountain snow. Unsettled weather will continue late week with
continued cooler temperatures.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
skies clearing west of Puget Sound with mostly cloudy skies Puget
Sound eastward. Showers on the doppler radar mostly in the
Cascades, north of Seattle and over the Southwest Interior at 930
am. Temperatures were in the 40s.

Showers lingering in the Cascades today. In the lowlands, a
temporary upper level ridge building offshore will create
northwesterly flow aloft drying up the shower activity in the
afternoon. A few sunbreaks this afternoon. Highs in the lower to
mid 50s. Current forecast on track.

Previous discussion follows. The next frontal system will
approach Western Washington later tonight, and move across the
area on Wednesday. Southeasterly winds will increase ahead of the
front, particularly Wednesday morning, for the coast, as well as
areas adjacent to Admiralty Inlet and San Juan Islands. At this
time, wind gusts are forecast to range 25 to 40 MPH for these
aforementioned areas, with approximately a 30 to 60% chance of 45
MPH gusts (or greater) along the north coast, as well as near San
Juan Islands. Winds will slowly taper, but remain elevated,
Wednesday afternoon. Lowland rain will also increase on Wednesday
with the frontal passage. In addition, there remains a slight
chance for thunderstorms along the Olympic Peninsula and coast on
Wednesday.

Snow levels Wednesday into Thursday will range 3000 to 4000 feet,
with periods of mountain snow. The initial timeframe of steadier
snowfall will be later Wednesday with the front, with a few inches
of snow possible for Stevens Pass and White Pass, and trace
amounts at Snoqualmie Pass into Wednesday night. Some uncertainty
exists as to the extent of precipitation on Thursday, but
continued troughing suggests further unsettled conditions and
showers over Western Washington. This would allow for additional,
light snowfall accumulation over the mountains. At this time, NBM
probabilities range 40-50% chance of 6" of snow at Stevens Pass
during a 48 hour period between 0500 Wednesday to 0500 Friday,
with slightly higher probabilities for White Pass given heavier
precipitation further south. Otherwise, highs will remain slightly
below average in the low 50s.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Broad troughing will continue
to be situated across the Pacific Northwest on Friday for likely
unsettled weather. There remains uncertainty in ensemble guidance
regarding the orientation of the trough, and thus the location of
heaviest precipitation late week. The multi-model ensemble as
shown on WPC Clusters keeps the heavier QPF over Oregon and
southern Washington on Friday, with lesser amounts farther
northwards across Western Washington. CMC ensembles are a bit more
of an outlier, similar to the deterministic run, in a more
consolidated upper low, with a further north solution of heavier
QPF. The main impact from this would be continued mountain
snowfall in varying intensity. Despite the uncertainty, shower
chances remain Friday into Friday night. NBM suggests
precipitation chances lessen, but remain Saturday into Sunday.
However, wouldn`t be surprised in a period of drier weather over
the weekend given some ridging building offshore on ensembles.
Another system may begin to impact the area Monday into next week.
Highs during this period near to slightly below normal. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak upper ridge is building into the region with
north to northwest flow aloft. The flow aloft will back to
southwesterly tonight as a frontal system approaches the area.
Abundant low level moisture will produce a mix of IFR/MVFR ceilings
through midday. Ceilings will gradually improve this afternoon.
Ceilings will deteriorate to low MVFR in rain along the coast by mid-
morning Wednesday with said conditions spreading to interior
terminals 18Z-20Z.

KSEA...Low MVFR ceilings likely to hang on through midday before
gradually lifting to VFR this afternoon. Increasing low level
easterly flow will keep ceilings higher tonight into Wednesday
morning before abruptly dropping back to low MVFR in rain by 19Z or
20Z Wednesday. Additionally, low level wind shear is likely just
ahead of the front on Wednesday morning with low level easterly flow
and strong southerly flow developing aloft. Surface winds light
southerly backing to E/SE tonight and rising to 8 to 11 knots
Wednesday A.M.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...A brief, and weak surface high will reside over area
waters today. Relatively calm seas are expected as the SCA over the
coastal waters will be allowed to expire. However, a stout sub 980mb
surface low is developing over the Gulf of Alaska and is forecast to
fill and track towards the offshore waters Tuesday night - Wednesday
morning. Active conditions are favored to return as strong southerly
winds increase. The current Gale Watch over the coastal waters will
likely upgrade to a Gale Warning as a 70-90% probability of gale
force winds remain. A lesser chance but still significant (40-50%)
of gale force winds exists over the East Strait for the same period.
Along with gales, SCA are becoming more probable as well,
particularly for the Northern Inland waters and Admiralty Inlet but
can`t rule out the potential for neighboring zones. The surface low
will track southeastward across the offshore waters Wednesday night
into Thursday. Then, surface ridging will rebuild over the waters
towards the weekend.

Coastal seas will decrease to 6-8 ft today but rise rapidly and
hazardously to 10-12 ft Tuesday night into Wednesday and likely
remain well-above 10 ft into early Friday.
