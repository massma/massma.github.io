.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system will move across Western Washington
through tonight for lowland rain and mountain snow. Another
weather system will move into southern Washington Sunday night.
Ridging Monday into Tuesday will promote drier weather, along with
morning fog on Tuesday. A weakening front on Wednesday before the
ridge builds again Thursday. Another system may then move through
late next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Stratiform precipitation
continues to spread eastward across Western Washington this
afternoon. This will continue into tonight for steadier rainfall
in the lowlands. Mountain snowfall will also increase into this
evening, including for the Cascade Passes. Snow levels initially
around 3000-4000 feet will rise to near 4500 feet Sunday morning.
Snow rates will be heaviest for the Cascade passes this evening
until around midnight to 2AM, before a potential transition to a
rain/snow mix at Snoqualmie Pass later tonight. Snowfall amounts
will likely range 6 to 12 inches for Stevens and White Pass, with
amounts of 3 to 7 inches for Snoqualmie Pass. If you`re traveling
over the Passes tonight, check WSDOT for the latest road
information. Otherwise, south winds will remain locally breezy
around Whidbey Island into this evening with gusts of 25 to 40
MPH. Steadier rain will transition to showers by Sunday morning.

Another system will move into southern Washington and northern
Oregon Sunday night for another round of lowland rainfall,
primarily south of Olympia. An upper ridge will then build
offshore Monday with the SW/NE oriented ridge axis moving over
Western Washington on Tuesday for drier weather. This will promote
the development of fog Tuesday morning due to abundant moisture
at the surface. Temperatures will also cool into the low to mid
30s Tuesday morning.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...The upper ridge will
flatten on Wednesday as a weakening front moves into British
Columbia. This will allow for a slight chance of rain Tuesday
night into Wednesday morning, mainly for the Olympic Peninsula and
North Cascades. However, QPF amounts are forecast to remain under
0.10" with the most noticeable aspect of this front an increase in
clouds for the majority of Western Washington. Ensembles suggest
the ridge builds back across the Pacific Northwest on Thursday for
another round of dry conditions, and potential morning fog.
Ensembles are then in general agreement of a more organized
frontal system moving across Western Washington Friday into
Saturday for lowland rain and higher elevation mountain snow.
Temperatures look to remain near to slightly above normal later
next week. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Flow aloft will become more westerly this evening and
persist into Sunday in the wake of an exiting upper level low.
Radar shows widespread rain moving into the interior this
afternoon associated with a frontal system still located offshore.
Area terminals are generally hovering between MVFR and VFR this
afternoon. Expect overall conditions to continue to lower towards
more widespread MVFR by tonight as a frontal system moves through
the area. Southeasterly surface winds have started to become more
southerly this afternoon and have increased along the coast and
south interior. Winds will continue to strengthen heading into
tonight with speeds 10-15 kts and with gusts up to 25 kt possible
at times. Rain will taper to showers overnight and winds will
ease into Sunday morning. With abundant low-level moisture, expect
ceilings at area terminals to lower further Sunday morning, with
areas of IFR possible through the morning hours. Ceilings then
look to improve towards MVFR again in the afternoon.

KSEA...Ceilings VFR in rain. Ceilings will lower to MVFR by
tonight. Even as rain tapers Sunday morning, abundant low-level
moisture will allow for ceilings and visibilities to lower towards
IFR after 12Z. Winds have transitioned to southerly this afternoon
and will increase to 10-15 kts tonight. Gusts to 20-25 kts will
be possible at times through late tonight, before winds ease
again after 12Z Sunday. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system moving across the area waters today will
bring a brief burst of southerly winds to the coastal waters and
portions of interior waters tonight. Small craft advisories remain
in place, though occasional gusts to 35 kt will be possible over
the coastal waters and across the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca
as this system makes its way through. The majority of the other
interior waters (with the exception of the central and western
Strait) will likely see a brief period of gusts to 25 kt within
the vicinity of the front. Seas across the coastal waters will
build and briefly become steep tonight, generally hovering
between 8 to 13 feet and persisting at 8 or 9 seconds.

Winds will ease and seas will subside towards 7 to 9 ft on
Sunday. A low pressure system to the south of the area will then
move inland over northern Oregon, allowing for high pressure to
build back over the area waters by early next week. Winds will
turn offshore Sunday night into Monday as a result. Seas look to
build towards 10 feet again across the outer coastal waters
Monday, bringing the potential for additional headlines at times.
Winds will then turn southerly towards mid-week as a weak frontal
system approaches. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system continues to bring steadier rainfall
this afternoon across the Olympic Peninsula. Rain will continue
into tonight before tapering off Sunday morning. Total rainfall
amounts of 1 to 2 inches for the southern Olympics will result in
a continued rise for the Skokomish River. A Flood Watch has been
issued for Mason County due to the Skokomish River near Potlach
potentially rising above flood stage early Sunday morning.

A drier weather pattern Monday into the middle of next week will
result in rivers slowly receding across the area. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
