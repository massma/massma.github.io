Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
136 PM EDT Wed Sep 11 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure will strengthen across the area mid to late week,
and remain in control through early next week.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Expect a mostly sunny day today, with cirrus moving off to the
east currently. Anywhere that hasn`t seen a sea breeze will
slowly come around to the south with the synoptic flow has the
center of high pressure shifts offshore. Temps in coastal
sections may be a touch less warm than those of yesterday, with
highs in the mid/upper 70s, but should be a touch warmer inland,
with upper 70s/lower 80s. Mostly clear skies tonight and
diminishing winds should lead to good radiational cooling, with
lows 60-65 in/around NYC and in the 50s elsewhere. With tonight
being the first night of onshore flow do not expect fog
development except in the river valleys.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT/...
Mainly dry conditions will continue with sfc high pressure
mostly in control. A shortwave trough digging southward across
New England may touch off an isolated shower or two across SE CT
toward evening. Otherwise, with sfc high pressure strengthening
and heights rising aloft expect progressively warmer
conditions despite onshore flow, with highs in the upper
70s/lower 80s on Thu, and some mid 80s possible on Fri across NE
NJ and some of the interior valleys. The continued onshore
flow and nighttime radiational cooling should promote more in
the way of fog development both Thu night and Fri night
inland, also across coastal SE CT and eastern Long Island, with
low temps mainly in the 50s inland and across the Long Island
Pine Barrens region, and 60s elsewhere.

&&

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
The period will feature an extended period of warm and dry
weather with deep-layered ridging over the Northeast.
Surface high pressure will remain stretched across the
Northeast into the western Atlantic. The high may weaken going
into Monday night and Tuesday as low pressure potentially
develops off the Southeast coast and tracks north. Low
temperatures will be near normal through the period with daytime
high temperatures a couple degrees above normal for most of the
days. Saturday appears to be the warmest with highs mostly in
the lower/mid 80s. There is the chance of valley fog and
radiational fog each night through Monday night. Have included
this in the weather grids for only Friday morning and late
Saturday night/early Sunday morning for the time being.

&&

.AVIATION /18Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure moves offshore to the east of New England in the
Atlantic through the TAF period.

Mainly VFR conditions are expected through the TAF period. The
exception is outside of NYC terminals with the potential for fog
late tonight into early Thursday which would reduce visibilities to
MVFR to IFR. Have TEMPO groups for KSWF, KHPN, KISP, KBDR and KGON
to indicate this.

Otherwise, winds 10 kts or less through the TAF period. Wind
direction generally SE to S this afternoon into this evening, and
variable late tonight into early Thursday morning, before returning
to more S to SE direction by late Thursday morning into Thursday
afternoon.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

KJFK/KEWR no unscheduled amendments expected.

KLGA/KTEB timing of sea breeze could be off by 1-2 hours.
Amendments possible.

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY...

Thursday afternoon-Monday: Mainly VFR. Chance of MVFR or lower
fog/clouds for the non-city terminals each late night/early
morning.

forecasts, can be found at: https:/www.weather.gov/zny/n90<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...
Quiet on the waters with high pressure in control and swell no
higher than 2 ft for most of the period. Swell may build to 3 ft
on Sunday in response to low pressure developing off the
Southeast coast.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
No hydrologic impacts expected.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
There is a moderate rip current risk at the NYC and eastern
Suffolk beaches today due to incoming 2-ft long period swell and
developing onshore flow. The moderate risk will continue for the
NYC beaches for Thu, where afternoon onshore flow will be
stronger.

&&

.OKX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CT...None.
NY...None.
NJ...None.
MARINE...None.
