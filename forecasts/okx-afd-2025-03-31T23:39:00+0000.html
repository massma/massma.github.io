Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
739 PM EDT Mon Mar 31 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
Low pressure tracks through southeastern Canada tonight dragging
a cold front across the region. High pressure builds in from
the north Tuesday and Tuesday night. The high over southern
Quebec builds southeastward Wednesday, pushing off the New
England coast Wednesday. Thereafter, an unsettled pattern sets
up with a frontal boundary near or over the area through the end
of the week into next weekend.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM TUESDAY MORNING/...
First batch of showers and thunderstorms out ahead of the
approaching cold front has moved through portions of NYC and
northeast NJ. Some training has prompted the issuance of a
Flood Advisory for portions of these areas, and is in effect
until 8 pm. Otherwise, more showers and thunderstorms have
developed to the west of the forecast area, from northern NJ,
southwestward into eastern PA. This line was moving into some
higher instability in regards to MUCAPE according to the SPC
mesoanalysis, but it looks to have decreased over the past
couple of hours.

The threat of strong to locally severe thunderstorms remains
across northeastern New Jersey, New York City, the lower Hudson
Valley and into portions of southwestern Connecticut and western
Long Island. The primary threat remains damaging wind gusts,
with large hail also possible, and an isolated tornado cannot be
totally ruled out. With the cold front moving into the region
by late evening, the severe thunderstorm threat diminishes and
the focus of any thunderstorms will be generally east of New
York City and across much of southern Connecticut. And with a
marine influence and a low level cap in place, thunderstorms
will become more isolated. The CAMs have handled the development
and track of the thunderstorms rather well for this evening,
and leaned toward them for timing and probabilities.

Once the cold front passes through winds shift to a gusty
northwest flow, and precipitation moves east of the area by
Tuesday morning.

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...
Tuesday and Tuesday night will be dry with temperatures bear
normal Tuesday, and slightly below normal Tuesday night as skies
will be mainly clear and winds will be diminishing. Temperatures
will be below freezing outside of the New York City metro area,
and in the mid to upper 30s in the metropolitan area. The
growing season begins April 1 for the metro area, and with the
forecast low Tuesday night, frost headlines will be possible.

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
An unsettled pattern sets up for much of the long term as
frontal boundary lies over or nearby the forecast area, with
waves of low pressure riding along the boundary at times,
bringing higher chances for precipitation.

Wednesday looks to remain dry during the day as high pressure
slides off the New England coast. Meanwhile, a low pressure
system over the northern Great Plains lifts northeast into the
Great Lakes region, sending a warm front north of the area late
Wednesday night into Thursday morning. The associated cold front
moves through late Thursday night into Friday morning with high
pressure nosing in from the north for Friday afternoon into
Friday night, pushing the cold front farther south. However, the
front lifts north once again Saturday into Saturday night and
remains nearby through the end of the weekend.

In terms of chances for precipitation, there will be some
uncertainty in the placement and timing of the frontal features
and any waves of low pressure that move through/nearby the
forecast area. However, a weak low that forms along the frontal
boundary to our southwest will give the western half of the
forecast area a decent chance for rain late Thursday night. The
low weakens as it heads east, giving eastern areas less of a
chance for precipitation. Friday afternoon into the first half
of Friday night looks to be dry as outer fringes of high
pressure from the north nose into the area during this time
frame. Then better chances for precipitation for the entire area
late Saturday into Saturday night as another low possibly forms
along the frontal boundary. Chances for precipitation decrease
for Sunday as the warm front lifts north and the cold front
approaches from the west. However, the area doesn`t totally dry
out until sometime Monday afternoon.

Depending on what side of the frontal boundary the area lies on
will dictate whether we will be above/below/near normal through
the period. The warm front lifting north on Thursday will mean
warm temperatures, with highs in the 70s away from the coast.
Upper 50s to 60s are expected along the coast. Cooler, but still
above normal temperatures for Friday. Close to normal expected
on Saturday with high pressure building in from the north. Then
above normal for Sunday as another warm front lifts north.

.AVIATION /00Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front will move through the terminals this evening. High
pressure will build in on Tuesday.

A few showers/thunderstorms have developed ahead of the main
line of rain and are expected to remain nearby city terminals
until the main line of thunderstorms moves in 00-04Z through the
city. Thunder could make it as far east as KISP. S CT will like
just be moderate to heavy showers with less of a chance of
thunderstorms. Conditions may lower to IFR in thunderstorms and
MVFR in showers. From 06Z-11Z the main line of
showers/thunderstorms should be east of the area with light
showers ending west to east across all terminals.

Gradual improvement expected after midnight from west to east.
VFR for Tuesday.

Winds will be S/SW early tonight around 7-12kt with a few gusts
near 20 kt, mainly for coastal locations. THunderstorms could
lead to temporarily stronger NW winds 20-25 kt with gusts up to
40 kt. Winds become NNW behind the cold front tonight and on
Tuesday will be 14-18 G23-27KT. Winds drop below 10 kt Tue night
from a mostly due N direction.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Southerly gusts around 20 kt may be occasional until the front
passes.

Amendments likely for timing of SHRA/+SHRA/TSRA early tonight.

Thunderstorms in the 0Z-04Z time window could have strong gusty
winds and hail.

Amendments likely to refine timing of SW to NNW wind direction
changes such as with the cold front.


.OUTLOOK FOR 00Z TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...

Wednesday: Mainly VFR during most of the day. MVFR or lower
possible late afternoon and at night with a chance of showers.
SE wind gusts 15-20 kt afternoon into evening.

Thursday: MVFR or lower possible with a chance of showers,
eventually becoming likely at night. SW wind gusts 15-20kt,
highest along the coast day into evening.

Friday: MVFR or lower possible early with a chance of showers.
Mainly VFR afternoon and at night.

Saturday: MVFR or lower likely in rain showers.

.MARINE...
A small craft advisory remains in effect for all the forecast
waters into Tuesday morning as strong gusty winds continue ahead
of a cold front, and then for gusty northwest winds late tonight
through Tuesday morning behind the front. Winds and gusts
diminish below advisory levels on the waters by Tuesday
afternoon, however, ocean seas will remain elevated into
Tuesday night, and the advisory was extended.

Winds remain below 25 kt over all waters Wednesday and much of
Wednesday night. The approach of a cold front Thursday will
bring winds back up to 25 to 30 kt over most if not all waters
as a low level jet strengthens over the area. Winds diminish
below 25 kt by late Thursday night and remain below 25 kt
through the rest of the long term.

5 ft waves on the ocean waters for Wednesday morning fall below 5 ft
by late morning into the afternoon. They quickly build to 5 ft again
early Wednesday night as southerly flow increases. Waves peak to 5
to 9 ft on the ocean waters by Thursday afternoon, then diminish
through  Friday morning to less than 5 ft.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
Showers and embedded thunderstorms are expected into tonight,
with widespread rainfall around an inch, and an area of up to 1
1/2 inches across northeastern New Jersey, across New York City,
and into portions of the lower Hudson Valley into southwestern
Connecticut. Locally higher amounts are possible. The primary
concern if flooding occurs is localized minor
nuisance/urban/poor drainage flooding.

After tonight no hydrologic impacts are expected through the
weekend.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
Water levels have been lower than fcst, and with astronomical
tide levels trending slightly lower for tonight, this will
limit any minor coastal flooding to isolated spots along some
shoreline locations of the South Shore Bays of Long Island and
the western Long Island Sound shoreline along Southern Fairfield
CT. A coastal flood statement has been issued for these areas
for tonight.

Timing of wind shift compared to time of high tide does not give
much factor to offshore flow. Time before high tides will be
mostly onshore. Both South Shore Bays and Western Long Island
Sound will have high tide pass before more continuous gusty NW
offshore flow gets established.

&&
