Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
741 PM PDT Thu Oct 24 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge over the area will keep western
Washington dry until late Friday evening. Unsettled weather will
persist throughout the weekend bringing gusty winds, rain, chance of
thunder, and mountain snow. Temporary relief from precipitation on
Tuesday as surface high pressure builds over the area. Another round
of storms returns mid next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Fairly flat ridging over W WA
this evening with high clouds moving east over the area. Most
locations seeing temps in the 40s as of 7 PM PDT, however portions
of Seattle, Everett and Tacoma hanging in there with low 50s. While
the aforementioned high clouds should keep overnight lows from
getting too cold, interior locations still expected to dip into the
mid to upper 30s overnight. Upper level ridge begins to look a
little more ridge-like for Friday, with fairly mild daytime highs
expected.

Inherited forecast handles this well with no need for an evening
update. For more forecast details, including the active weather
still on tap for Friday night and beyond, please refer to the
Previous Discussion section below.

From Previous Discussion...The early light showers have tapered off
and satellite is currently showing mostly clear to partly cloudy
skies in the area. Slightly warmer and drier conditions should
persist until tomorrow with the upper level ridge situated over the
area. A deepening upper level trough is expected to bring unsettled
weather through the area Friday evening through the rest of the
weekend. The main concern with this system will be the winds,
particularly Friday evening through Saturday morning. Strong
southerly winds will first impact locations along the coast and then
make their way inland into Friday night. The strongest winds will be
along the coast and Admiralty Inlet, with maximum wind gusts between
35 to 45 mph. Other locations that will see strong winds gusts
include the San Juan Islands and Western Whatcom County,with maximum
wind gusts of 25 to 40 mph. Other locations can also expect breezy
conditions. Easterly winds will bring breezy winds through the
Cascade Gaps, near North Bend and Monroe through the day on Friday.
A Wind Advisory is set to go into effect on Friday night for
Admiralty Inlet and North Coast areas. Localized power outages and
tree limb damage is possible with this wind event.


Rain will likely begin to move into the coast Friday night and
gradually become more widespread into the weekend. The highest
rain accumulations will be along the coast and mountain ranges (2
to 4 inches). Other locations in the lowlands will see around 1
to 1.5 inches. Refer to the .HYDROLOGY section for additional
information. In addition, there is a chance for isolated
thunderstorms possible on Sunday, with models showing a 15 to 20
percent chance. This will bring the chance for higher localized
rainfall accumulations. This weather system will also bring a few
inches of snow to the mountains on Sunday as snow levels lower to
4000 to 4500 ft. Temperatures through the weekend will generally
be in the 50s, near normal.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...From Previous
Discussion...The upper trough axis will move overhead and slide
eastward on Monday for continued unsettled conditions and periodic
showers. Snow levels will also lower further Monday to near 3500 to
4500 feet for light higher elevation mountain snowfall. Brief break
in the precipitation may be possible on Tuesday with a flattening
ridge overhead. The active weather pattern then returns Wednesday
into Thursday as troughing digs southward over the Pacific Northwest
from BC. Uncertainty exists in the ensembles regarding the
trajectory of the trough, as well as location during this period.
However, given the relatively lower snow levels in place, mainly
between 3000 to 4500 feet, another round of accumulating snowfall is
possible for the Cascade Passes. Otherwise, high temperatures will
be approximately 5-10 degrees cooler than normal next week. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly-southwesterly flow aloft with easing northerly
flow the surface as transient ridging remains over the area. Mostly
VFR conditions this evening with high clouds overhead and little in
the way of low clouds expected. Latest guidance shows limited fog
development tonight into Friday morning. Any fog that does develop
will likely be localized in the river valleys near KOLM for brief
MVFR/IFR conditions. As such, confidence remains low for inclusion
in any TAF save for OLM. VFR will likely persist elsewhere thru
Friday, and any stations that do dip down to lower categories should
rebound to VFR by late morning.

KSEA...VFR conditions with light northerly winds ranging 5 to 10
knots this evening and overnight. Winds will take a slight NE
component through Friday morning and stick between 7 to 9 knots. Not
much confidence in any fog forming at the terminal in the morning,
with a 20% chance of MVFR conditions through 17z.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure continues to remain over the waters
resulting in rather benign conditions through the beginning of
Friday.

A robust frontal system will start to approach the area
waters by Friday afternoon, with southerly winds increasing over
waters. after 00z, and continue throughout the Small craft
southerlies are in place starting Friday afternoon over the coastal
waters, before increasing to Gale Strength by Friday night into
Saturday. The Gale Watch for the coastal waters has been upgraded to
a Gale Warning. A Gale Warning has also been issued for East
Entrance of the Strait of Juan De Fuca and Admiralty Inlet for
strong southeasterlies.

As the system moves over the interior waters late Friday night,
winds will also increase in the West and Central Entrance of the
Strait along with the Northern Interior Waters for small craft
advisories. Other inner waters, such as Puget Sound, may also
reach headline criteria but as of now confidence is low.

Coastal seas today are around 3 to 6 feet, but will start to build
upwards to 13 to 15 feet Friday night into Saturday. The highest
seas will be focused mainly in the outer water zones (13 to 15
feet) meanwhile, seas 9 to 12 feet will be focused more in the
inner water zones, closer to the coast. Seas look to remain 10+
into the first half of next week.

.HYDROLOGY...A frontal system will move into Western Washington
Friday night with unsettled weather, and periods of steadier
precipitation, through Monday. Snow levels will rise to 7000 to 8000
feet on Saturday, before falling to near 4000 feet on Monday.
QPF totals during this period are expected to range 2 to 4 inches
across the Olympics and Cascades, leading to a rise in area rivers.
At this time, river flooding is not expected. However, rivers will
continue to be monitored, particularly the Skokomish River this
weekend.
