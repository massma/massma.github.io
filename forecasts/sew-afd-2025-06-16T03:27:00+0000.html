827 PM PDT Sun Jun 15 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Upper level troughing will remain the dominant
influence across western Washington through much of the next
week. A few weak fronts will bring chances of showers to western
Washington Tuesday into Wednesday. The more notable chances of
precipitation over the next week will be Friday into Saturday as a
low offshore pushes inland over the area.

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>It remains clear across the region this evening. No
updates made to the forecast below (except for the aviation
discussion with minor updates).

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Southwest flow aloft
will allow for slightly warmer conditions today, with highs on
track to reach the upper 60s to low 70s across much of the region
today. Clouds will slowly increase along the coast tonight as the
next system approaches.

Onshore flow will continue Monday as a weak and mostly dry front
pushes inland. Most of the region will see little more than
increased clouds and a few sprinkles, with clearing skies in the
afternoon after the front passes. Temperatures will peak again in
the upper 60s to low 70s for most inland areas, with highs in the
low 60s along the coast.

Another weak front will lift north across western Washington on
Tuesday, bringing increased clouds and chances of showers along
the coast. Overall rainfall amounts will be light, with most
areas expected to only see a couple hundredths of an inch of
rain. Afternoon highs will again be in the upper 60s to mid 70s
across the interior and low 60s along the coast.

A cold front will shift inland late Tuesday into Wednesday,
bringing in a quick shot of light rain and cloudy skies.
Precipitation amounts will be light, especially south and east of
the Puget Sound. The bulk of the moisture will be focused over the
Olympic Peninsula and North Cascades, where up to a quarter inch
of rain is possible. A majority of the lowlands will see
accumulations of a few hundredths. Temperatures will once again
reach the upper 60s to mid 70s across the interior and low 60s
along the coast.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...A cutoff low will approach
the coast towards the end of the week, with light post frontal
showers lingering over higher terrain on Thursday. The low
pressure system will shift inland on Friday throughout next
weekend, bringing in the most notable precipitation of the
forecast period alongside breezy winds and cooler temperatures.
At this time, rainfall across the lowlands look to range between
a quarter to a third of an inch of accumulation, with an inch or
more of liquid over the Olympics and Cascades. This cooler storm
system will also bring snow levels down to 5000-6000 feet,
resulting in some light snow accumulations over the higher peaks.
Over the weekend, temperatures will peak below normal in the low
to mid 60s for much of the region.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft will continue through Monday with
ridging over the interior Pacific Northwest and troughing offshore.
Mostly clear skies this evening across Western Washington. VFR high
clouds will increase tonight into Monday morning. Onshore flow will
also increase tonight, with MVFR/IFR stratus developing along the
coast early Monday morning. The eastward extent of stratus is
expected to be around KSHN. Otherwise, VFR high clouds at times for
the interior on Monday. N/NW surface winds will ease tonight before
becoming more W/SW on Monday.

KSEA...VFR conditions through the TAF period. High clouds will
increase tonight and continue at times on Monday. Northerly surface
winds tonight will transition more S/SW Monday morning (generally
between 13 to 16z). Winds may transition NW by Monday evening. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the coastal waters today will
maintain northwesterly. A weak cold front early Monday morning
will bring southwesterly winds, with winds turning more southerly
Tuesday. Generally calm conditions for the coastal waters as
additional systems traverse the waters throughout the week.

Diurnally driven pushes of westerly winds down the Strait of Juan de
Fuca will occur during the evening hours over the next several days
with varying degrees of intensity. Today`s push looks to remain
below small craft strength, with sustained wind speeds around 15-20
kt for the central and east Strait. In addition, may occasionally
see some gusts up to 25 kt. However, with probabilities being 20% or
less in exceeding 21 kt across the Strait, decided to hold off on
issuing a Small Craft.

Seas across the coastal waters will generally remain between 3-4 ft
today, increasing to 4-6 ft on Monday. By midweek, seas will subside
to 3-5 ft. A system at the end of the week will allow for seas to
build towards 5-7 ft by the weekend.
