.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridging over Western Washington will bring
warmer temperatures Sunday and Monday. A gradual cooling trend
begins on Tuesday as the ridge begins to weaken. On Wednesday a
trough will approach the coast and move inland on Thursday, with a
troughing pattern favored into the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mostly clear skies across
Western Washington this afternoon, with daytime temperatures
expected to peak in the upper 60s to low 70s along the coast and
upper 70s to low 80s along the interior. An upper level ridge over
the region will bring very warm temperatures Sunday and Monday.
Sunday will be the hottest day, with high temperatures in the upper
60s to low 70s along the coast and 80s to low 90s along the interior
(warmest temperatures along southwest interior and Cascade
foothills). High temperatures on Monday will be a couple degrees
cooler. In addition, limited overnight relief is expected as low
temperatures are expected to stay on the warm side. Low temperatures
on Sunday will be in the mid 50s along the coast and upper 50s along
the interior. Monday`s low temperatures will be slightly warmer with
upper 50s to low 60s along the interior. The upper level ridge will
begin to weaken on Tuesday, with high temperatures cooling into
the low 60s along the coast and upper 70s to low 80s along the
interior.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...A gradual cooling trend
is expected for the rest of the week as an upper level trough
approaches the Washington coastline on Wednesday and moves inland on
Thursday. There is general agreement among ensemble guidance that a
troughing pattern will dominate late in the week into the weekend.
However, there is uncertainty in trough axis location and strength
of the trough. Precipitation wise, models at this time are keeping
Western Washington generally dry, with the exception of the
north and central Cascades that may see some light precipitation.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>North to Northwest flow will continue into Sunday with
an upper ridge located over the Pacific Northwest. VFR conditions
into tonight with mainly clear skies. Stratus may slide inland along
the immediate coast tonight, with potential LIFR cigs at HQM into
Sunday AM. Otherwise, mostly clear on Sunday. N/NW surface winds
will become light tonight, before increasing again on Sunday.

KSEA...VFR conditions with mainly clear skies during the TAF period.
N/NW surface winds of 7 to 12 kts into this evening will transition
more NE at 5 to 8 kts tonight. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will remain over the Coastal Waters through
Wednesday. Northerly diurnal driven winds expected for the interior
waters through Tuesday. Northwest winds will also remain elevated
over the Coastal Waters through next week. Onshore flow will
increase midweek.

Small Craft Advisory winds are possible beginning Sunday evening
into next week for the outer Coastal Waters. Increasing onshore flow
Tuesday into Wednesday will also bring potential SCA winds during
the evening periods through the Strait of Juan de Fuca. In addition,
will need to monitor the potential for any gales in the Strait of
Juan de Fuca midweek with the increased west winds.

Seas of 4 to 6 feet through Sunday morning will build to 8 to 12
feet Monday into Tuesday. In addition, periods will also range 8 to
12 seconds later Sunday into Monday. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The warm and dry trend will continue Sunday into
Monday as an upper level ridge moves across Western Washington and
low level onshore flow comes to an end. This will elevate fire
weather concerns Sunday and Monday as minimum RH values will likely
reach as low as 25-35% over the Cascades and Cascade foothills with
slightly higher percentages over the interior lowlands. While live
fuels are still wet enough to curb fire spread, dead fuels remain
very dry. In addition the snowpack is below normal and some
locations are experiencing drought conditions. Winds remain light
enough into Monday such that critical fire weather conditions are
not expected but the area is drying out fast. Moist onshore flow
will return Monday night into Tuesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
