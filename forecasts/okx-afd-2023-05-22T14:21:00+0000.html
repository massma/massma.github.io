Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
1021 AM EDT Mon May 22 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
A backdoor cold front moves across the area this morning, then
stalls in the lower Hudson Valley to western Long Island before
dissipating this evening. High pressure will be in control
tonight through Tuesday night. A cold front moves through
Wednesday afternoon into Wednesday evening. High pressure
returns late week, potentially remaining in place through the
weekend as an area of low pressure meanders south of the region.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Just a few minor adjustments to current observations.

Otherwise, a backdoor cold front remains in the vicinity of the
NY/PA border, and extends eastward across the Lower Hudson
Valley into LI Sound and across eastern Long Island. This front
is not expected to move much today. Soundings indicate
developing instability across the lower Hudson Valley this
afternoon, along with CAPE up to 200-400 J/kg, and weak lift.
Inland cumulus are expected to be widespread and a few will
deepen to produce light rain, and possibly thunder. Showers end
early this evening with the loss of heating and as the frontal
boundary dissipates.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...
Once the stalled frontal boundary dissipates high pressure
centered across northern New England into eastern Canada will
remain across the region tonight through Tuesday night. A light
east flow around the high will keep temperatures below seasonal
normals tonight through Tuesday night.

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
Surface high pressure shifts offshore to start the period,
ahead of an approaching cold front currently progged to pass
through during the late afternoon and early evening hours on
Wednesday. The onshore flow will limit daytime heating along the
coast, where highs remain in the 60s. Inland, a mild SW flow
likely allows some areas to achieve the upper 70s.

With limited moisture, not anticipating a widespread rainfall
from the fropa, though a few scattered showers potentially make
it into the region as the front sinks south, with highest
chances of seeing across the interior. Also can`t rule out an
isolated thunderstorm, especially across the Lower Hudson Valley
where model soundings indicate some weak instability in the
late afternoon.

Conditions dry out Wednesday night behind the front, with a
1030 mb high building in from the northwest once again. Blustery
conditions may persist into Thursday with the tightened
pressure gradient, generally gusts up to 25 mph. Blended in the
NBM 90th percentile for winds late Wed night into Thursday due
to this possibility.

On the tail end of the departing trough, an H5 low cuts off and
meanders near or over the Southeast US into the holiday
weekend. Global guidance continues to vary with solutions run to
run, so nothing set in stone just yet with regard to
precipitation. Still, the trend with the 00z ensemble suite has
been drier for the local region, so capped PoPs at lower chance
(30%) much of the weekend. Temperatures will be near normal, if
not just below it, for much of the period, with highs in the 60s
and 70s.

Other than previously noted changes, national blended guidance was
followed for this update.

.AVIATION /14Z MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A backdoor cold front stalls over the Lower Hudson Valley this
afternoon and evening. High pressure builds across the terminals
tonight into Tuesday.

VFR. Light N winds gradually veer to the NE 5-10 kt this
morning, then E/SE by afternoon. Speeds increase into the low
teens (kt) for coastal terminals this afternoon, and around 10
kt elsewhere, lightening under 10 kt and backing easterly
overnight into Tue AM.

There is a chance of a few scattered showers for Lower Hudson
Valley terminals, mainly KSWF, this afternoon into early
evening. While a rumble of thunder or two is possible here,
confidence is too low to include in TAF at this time.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Timing of wind shift to the E and SE may be off by 1-2 hours.

The afternoon KJFK, KLGA, KEWR haze potential forecast is
YELLOW...which implies slant range visibility 4-6SM outside of
cloud.

OUTLOOK FOR 12Z TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...

Tuesday through Friday: Mainly VFR. Brief MVFR conditions
possible with a chance of SHRA Wednesday afternoon/evening. N
wind G15-20kt Wednesday night into Thursday.

can be found at: https:/www.weather.gov/zny/n90<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...
Seas were up to a foot lower on the ocean waters than forecast
and adjusted downward early this morning. Seas will increase
with an increasing northeast flow mid to late morning as a
backdoor cold front moves into the waters and stalls across the
western waters this afternoon. Easterly winds may briefly gust
to near 25 kt on the ocean waters east of Moriches Inlet this
afternoon. Otherwise, high pressure will be in control and winds
and seas will remain below SCA levels across the forecast
waters through Tuesday night.

Increasing northerly flow behind a frontal passage Wednesday evening
may allow winds to gust up to 25 kt late Wednesday night through
Thursday morning, especially on the ocean. Ocean seas may hang near
5 ft through the day Thursday before subsiding below SCA criteria.

The pressure gradient and winds weaken by Thursday evening, with sub-
advisory conditions expected on all waters thereafter into the
weekend.
