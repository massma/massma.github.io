Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
322 AM PDT Sun Aug 4 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure aloft to start the week with continued
above normal temperatures and dry weather. However, increased
onshore flow will bring near-normal conditions on Tuesday before
warming up shortly afterwards. Nearby disturbances may usher
marginal thunderstorm potential over the Cascades towards the
second half of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Not much change in the
pattern as the forecast has been rather rinse and repeat. The
persistent Four Corners high continues to be the major player in
today and Monday`s forecast. Above average temperatures and
dry weather is a sure bet but looming upstream sits a subtle
shortwave trough just off the coast. As it gradually progress
inland, increased onshore flow off the Pacific is slated to cool
temperatures down to seasonal values on Tuesday. Marine layer
activity will persist in varying coverage throughout the short
term before becoming widespread on Tuesday by way of the
aforementioned trough. Highs for today and Monday will range
between the mid to upper 80s across the interior but cooler along
the coast and San Juans with 60s and 70s. Mid 70s to lower 80s are
in for Tuesday. Low temperatures are to range between to 50s and
60s for the next few nights.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Deterministic guidance has
the aforementioned shortwave trough tracking across WA through
Wednesday. Will have to monitor the continued threat for elevation
convection during the second half of the week. Around Thursday-
Friday, ensembles and deterministic models are hinting at a upper-
low drifting southward out of Alberta/BC and upper-ridging
upstream over the NE Pac. Ensemble guidance continues to favor
above normal temperatures through the rest of the forecast period.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak upper trough remains centered just offshore
today producing southwest flow aloft over Western Washington. The
low level flow remains onshore, but is marginally weaker than 24
hour ago. IFR/LIFR stratus will spread into portions of Puget Sound
12Z to 16Z before once again burning back to the coast. IFR in
stratus will likely remain in place along the coast much of the day.

KSEA...Weaker onshore gradients this morning should result in a
briefer period of stratus this morning...perhaps only an hour or two
between 13Z and 15Z. Otherwise, VFR prevails today. Surface winds
light southwesterly becoming west to northwesterly 4 to 7 knots this
afternoon.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A broad surface ridge will remain centered offshore with
lower pressure inland throughout the week ahead for varying degrees
of onshore flow. Diurnally driven increases in the westerlies
through the Strait of Juan de Fuca will come close to or exceed
small advisory levels on a near daily basis. Persistent northwest
winds over the outer coastal waters will maintain steep conditions
over the next few days with seas of 5 or 6 feet. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SEW WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>WA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 5 PM this afternoon to 3 AM PDT Monday
     for Central U.S. Waters Strait Of Juan De Fuca-East
     Entrance U.S. Waters Strait Of Juan De Fuca.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
