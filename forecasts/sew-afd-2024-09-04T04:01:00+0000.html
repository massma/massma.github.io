Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
901 PM PDT Tue Sep 3 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A strong upper level ridge will build over the
northwest by midweek. Temperatures will increase well above
average for all areas Wednesday through Friday, with Thursday
being the warmest day with widespread moderate heat risk. The
ridge will depart eastward by the weekend, dropping temperatures
into the weekend.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No updates this evening,
previous discussion follows.

By Wednesday, the upper level trough will depart and dig over
Idaho/Montana. Washington state will see troughing replaced by
strong upper level ridging as a strong bubble of high pressure
forms over the East Pacific, and begins to advance into the region
through the second half of the work week. The jet flow pattern
weakens quite a bit overhead, as thermal troughing sets up over
the coast below the ridge. This will help aid in seasonally above
average temperatures (for this time in September) in western
Washington. The temperatures for Wednesday will be significantly
warmer than Tuesday (with significantly clearer skies) - upper 70s
to low and mid 80s (with the warmest temper

A heat advisory was issued for a majority of western Washington
Thursday and Friday for the warmer temperatures. Heat risk during
this period will be widespread moderate (orange) and isolated
areas of major (red) heat risk in the valley areas (Cascades and
Olympics). The warmest day will on Thursday, with high
temperatures ranging from the upper 80s (coastal areas and higher
elevations) to low and mid 90s (urban areas, Southwest Interior,
and valley areas). There is low confidence in elevated smoke from
wildfires in Oregon making it into Washington. The flow pattern
aloft is weak, but if some elevated smoke makes it into the
region, it may bring prevent sunlight from making it to the
surface, and bring temperatures down a couple degrees. There will
still be HeatRisk impacts either way with this synoptic pattern
moving into Western Washington.

The heat continues into Friday with highs just a few degrees
cooler than Thursday. The heat risk will still remain moderate
(with pockets of major heat risk in valley areas). Low temperatures
will range in the upper 50s to low 60s overnight for all areas.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The upper level ridge/high
pressure system will move east Friday into Saturday. High
temperatures will drop substantially on Saturday with highs in the
upper 70s to low/mid 80s. A trough over the Pacific will bring
southerly to southwesterly flow into the region early next week.
Cloud coverage will increase, and there is a slight chance of rain
showers along the coast Sunday, and spreading to the entire
coverage area by Tuesday. High temperatures will drop into the 70s
during this period.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northerly flow through evening will transition more
northeasterly on Wednesday with an upper ridge building over the
area. Stratus will continue along the coast through this evening.
LIFR/IFR stratus will slowly move inland again through the lower
Chehalis valley as well as Strait of Juan de Fuca. Areas of
LIFR/IFR cigs will also be possible in southern and central Puget
Sound, but expected to be more limited. Any stratus will clear by
Wednesday afternoon with a return to VFR conditions. N/NW winds
into this afternoon will become lighter tonight before increasing
Wednesday.


KSEA...Clear skies early tonight, but still a low end chance
(around 20%) for IFR stratus for a few hours around 13-15z.
Anything that forms should clear quickly with VFR under clear
skies Wednesday afternoon. Light northeast winds overnight,
becoming northwest and increasing Wednesday morning.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A thermally induced trough will extend northward along the
coast on Wednesday, allowing for flow to transition to offshore and
then persist through Thursday. The trough will move inland on
Friday, allowing for high pressure over the northeastern Pacific to
build back into the coastal waters and for flow to transition back
to onshore. During this period, northerly winds will be dominant
over the majority of waters, with periods of east winds through the
Strait of Juan de Fuca.

Seas will generally hover between 3 to 5 feet through Wednesday for
the Coastal Waters. Seas are expected to build again, this time
reaching 5 to 8 feet Thursday and Friday and largely shorter
period and dominated by wind-driven seas.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.FIRE WEATHER...Upper level ridging and an associated surface
thermal trough will be building and moving into western Washington
Wednesday into Thursday. This will allow for temperatures to begin
to rise and the air mass will begin to dry out and become unstable.
As fuels continue to dry, these conditions will combine to create
elevated to near-critical fire weather conditions over the mountains
on Thursday. A return to onshore flow over the Olympic Peninsula
will begin to bring cooler, moist air to the Olympics, but the
Cascades remain warm, dry and unstable. A Fire Weather Watch has
been issued for all the mountain zones for Thursday, going through
Friday as well for the Cascades. A return to onshore flow on Friday
looks to bring just enough moisture to relieve the Olympic mountains
of critical fire weather conditions, while conditions remain dry and
unstable through Friday over the Cascades.

Winds will also turn easterly over the Cascades beginning late on
Wednesday. While they will not be overly strong, a period of breezy
winds is expected late Wednesday night into early Thursday morning
as air funnels through the gaps over the Cascade crest. Another
period of offshore flow is expected Thursday night into Friday, but
it looks to be less strong.

Cooler and more moist air will return area-wide through the weekend
and into the beginning of next week. LH
