Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
912 AM PDT Sun Jun 15 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Upper level troughing will remain the dominant
influence across western Washington through much of the next
week. A few weak fronts will bring chances of showers to western
Washington Tuesday into Wednesday. The more notable chances of
precipitation over the next week will be Friday into Saturday as a
low offshore pushes inland over the area.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The latest forecast remains
on track with no updates this morning. Upper level troughing will
remain the dominant influence across western Washington through
the first part of the week as an upper level low spins across the
northeastern Pacific.

Latest satellite imagery shows a stratus layer across western
Washington starting to burn off, which will scour out by the late
morning. The upper level trough over the northeastern Pacific
will dig southward today, allowing for 500 mb heights to amplify
somewhat across western Washington. As a result, afternoon highs
will climb a few degrees from yesterday`s and top out in the upper
60s to mid 70s across the interior. Highs along the coast will be
in the 60s.

Onshore flow will continue into Monday, with clouds increasing
across the region. High temperatures will be similar to today`s,
generally topping out in the upper 60s to low 70s across the
majority of the interior. Highs along the coast will be in the
60s. A few light showers may be possible along the North Coast
with a warm front offshore, but precipitation looks to be rather
minimal.

A weak cold front then looks to approach the region on Tuesday,
bringing increased chances of showers along the coast. Overall
amounts look to be light, with most spots only expected to see a
couple hundredths of an inch of rain. Afternoon highs will again
be in the upper 60s to mid 70s across the interior and low 60s
along the coast.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...The aforementioned cold
front will then make its way inland on Wednesday, bringing
chances of showers to the interior. Overall rainfall amounts look
light at this time, with areas across the lowlands likely only
receiving a trace of precipitation to a few hundredths of an inch.
A few spots may not even see any rain. The highest amounts will
be across the terrain of the North Cascades, where up to a quarter
of an inch of rain is possible. A few post-frontal showers may
linger into Thursday, but expect Thursday to be a drier day across
the region as a whole.

The most notable precipitation for the week is likely Friday into
Saturday as the upper level low situated over the northeastern
Pacific sinks southward and moves inland over the area. This cool
system will allow for snow levels across the Cascades to fall
between 5000-6000 ft and could even bring some wintry precipitation
to the tallest peaks. Will need to see how this continues to trend
over the next several days, however. Afternoon high temperatures
look to only climb into the low to mid 60s for much of the area
during this time.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft persists with a stationary upper
level low over the Gulf of Alaska.. The stratus has began to scatter
fairly quickly this morning and VFR conditions have returned to all
the terminals. VFR conditions expected for the rest of the day. Mid
to high level clouds will begin to move in and increase in coverage
tonight into Monday morning, which should curb the low stratus the
low stratus threat for Monday morning. N/NE winds this morning will
shift NW during the day today.

KSEA...The stratus has scattered out at the terminal this morning
and expecting VFR conditions to persist for the day. NE winds this
morning will become NW by midday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will remain in place across the coastal
waters today, helping to maintain northwesterly winds across the
area. Diurnally driver pushes of westerly winds down the Strait of
Juan de Fuca will occur during the evening hours over the next
several days. Westerly winds have eased across the central and east
portions of the Strait this morning and the Small Craft Advisory has
been allowed to expire. The westerly push tonight generally looks to
remain below small craft strength at this time, with winds mostly
persisting between 15-20 kt.

A weak frontal system will approach the region on Monday and push
through the area waters Tuesday into Wednesday. This will allow for
winds across the coastal waters to transition to southerly. A low
pressure system then looks to sink southward into the region on
Friday and push inland over the weekend.

Seas across the coastal waters will generally remain between 3-5 ft
today, increasing to 4-6 ft on Monday. Seas then look to subside
back towards 3-5 ft by midweek. The system at the end of the week
will allow for seas to build towards 6-8 ft by the weekend.
