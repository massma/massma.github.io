Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
252 AM EST Sun Nov 3 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure remains over the region into Monday, moving off the
New England late Monday, then remaining offshore Tuesday. A warm
front will pass to the north Monday night into Tuesday. A cold
front slowly approached on Wednesday and moves through sometime
Wednesday evening. The front may stall south of the area as high
pressure builds in to end the week. Another cold front may pass
through the area Friday night or Saturday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure remains over the region, centered near Lake
Ontario at 07Z. A Frost Advisory remains in effect until 800 AM
EST for areas likely to experience frost with the exception of
interior locations, since their growing season has now ended,
and the NYC metropolitan area. Temperatures, and a rather dry
airmass, will be marginal for frost formation overnight into
early this morning as light northerly winds persist. Will re-
evaluate the advisory at the time of the morning update.

High pressure remains over the area into tonight with near
seasonal temperatures. Tonight temperatures will once again fall
into the mid and upper 30s across coastal Connecticut and
Suffolk county, despite weak warm advection setting up late at
night. Frost formation will be possible tonight as winds become
light, and the flow becomes easterly, raising dew points into
the lower 30s. However, higher clouds will be moving in and
temperatures may not be as low as currently forecast. With the
current advisory in effect, and the uncertainty with frost
development tonight will not issue an advisory for Sunday night
at this time.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The surface high beginning to move off the New England coast
late Monday and then becomes nearly stationary off the coast
into Tuesday. Warm advection increases Monday into Monday night
with a light southerly flow. Monday`s highs will be just above
seasonal normals, and lows Monday night will be nearly 10
degrees above normal as a warm front passes to the north. With
an increased return flow, and a warm front well to the north,
temperatures Tuesday will be 10 to nearly 15 degrees above
normal.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Key Points:

* Unseasonable warmth continues on Wednesday with the potential
  for near record to record high max temperatures.

* Cooling trend Thursday through Saturday with mainly dry conditions.

The upper level ridge axis will be east of the area at the start of
Tuesday night as a flattening shortwave approaches from the north
and west. An associated surface low will pass well to our north, but
drag a cold front through the area likely sometime Wednesday
evening. Deep SW/W flow ahead of the front should allow for
temperatures to peak in the upper 70s to low 80s. These temperatures
would be record or near record highs for 11/6.

Only slight chance PoPs with the passing of the front. There is
potential for the front to stall near the area. The Canadian was the
most aggressive with this 24 hours ago, but has trended towards a
drier solution like the GFS and ECMWF.

High pressure builds in to end the week, with the potential for
another cold frontal passage Friday night or Saturday. A cooling
trend is expected Thursday through Saturday, however, highs through
this time will likely remain above normal for early November.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

ft. Conditions start to improve Wednesday night and sub- SCA
conditions are expected thereafter.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
