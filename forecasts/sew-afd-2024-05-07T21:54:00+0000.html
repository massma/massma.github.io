Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
254 PM PDT Tue May 7 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough will exit the region today and
a ridge of high pressure aloft will begin to build into the area
on Wednesday. The upper ridge will strengthen toward the end of
the week as thermally induced low pressure near the surface
expands northward into the area. Dry conditions will prevail along
with the warmest temperatures of the year thus far on Friday and
Saturday. A weak system passing to the north of the area will
bring a minor cooling trend Sunday into Monday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Scattered showers over much
of the area will linger through the afternoon becoming limited to
the Cascades the evening. There remains a 15-25% chance of
isolated thunder over the Central and South Cascades this evening
before showers completely taper out as upper level ridging begins
to build into the area overnight. Morning clouds Wednesday
morning will give way to sunshine with near normal high
temperatures nosing well into the mid 60s.


The the offshore upper level ridge will tip further over the
region Thursday with thermally induced low pressure expanding
northward along the Oregon coast. This will turn the low level
flow northerly and offshore, which will help warming along the
coastal areas a bit more than the interior. Hoquiam and Forks are
expected to warm into the mid 70s (or higher) on Thursday
afternoon. Interior areas will warm up as well...with lower to mid
70s common from the Seattle area southward. The upper ridge axis
shifts onshore on Friday while the thermal trough remains more or
less oriented along the coast. This will likely be the warmest day
for the coast...with highs reaching the lower to mid 80s
especially along the North Coast...which is daily record
territory. In fact, there is a 90% chance of temperatures at or
above 80 at Forks on Friday. Elsewhere, sunshine and warm
temperatures with similar probabilities for temperatures above 80
across the interior lowlands from the Seattle Metro area southward
, including much of the central Kitsap Peninsula. Model guidance
continues to hint a a more progressive shift in the pattern Friday
night with the ridge axis potentially broadening over much of the
Western US and the thermal trough shifting inland.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The shift of the thermally
induced surface trough onshore will help onshore flow and cooler
temperatures for the Coastal areas with 15 to 20 degrees of
cooling for Saturday. Warm temperatures will very likely linger
for much of the interior, potentially as warm as Friday especially
through the metro area. Onshore flow and a weakening in the ridge
on Sunday as a system passes to the north will help temperatures
dip into the 60s and 70s - still near or just above normal and
dry. Dry and warm spring weather looks to linger into mid week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge will continue to build offshore
through Wednesday with northwesterly flow aloft transitioning more
northerly tonight. VFR mid clouds across much of the area this
afternoon with lingering showers. Showers will dissipate this
evening with drier weather tonight. VFR cigs will continue into
tonight. Areas of MVFR/IFR may develop Wednesday morning, although
confidence is low on the extent of stratus. Otherwise, VFR on
Wednesday. Generally N/NW winds through this evening will lighten
tonight before increasing midday Wednesday.

KSEA...VFR mid clouds this afternoon with dissipating showers. BKN
VFR will become SCT this evening into tonight. A period of MVFR cigs
will be possible Wednesday morning, mainly between 13-18z, with
probabilities ranging 30-35%. Otherwise, VFR expected on Wednesday.
N/NW winds this afternoon will become lighter and transition more
E/NE tonight. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the waters through Wednesday night.
Thermally induced low pressure then will move up the coast on
Thursday and shift inland Friday and east of the Cascades later on
Saturday. Westerly winds will continue to remain breezy into
Wednesday, particularly for the central Strait of Juan de Fuca, with
Small Craft Advisory winds during this period, along with adjacent
waters. Northerly winds will increase Wednesday afternoon into
Wednesday evening, especially for the inner Coastal Waters, where
brief SCA wind gusts may be possible. North winds then continue into
the weekend.

Seas of 10 feet will subside to 8 to 9 feet tonight and 6 to 7 feet
on Wednesday. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
