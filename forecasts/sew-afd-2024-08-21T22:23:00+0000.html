Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper low offshore of Vancouver Island with slide
southward through Friday for continued cool, unsettled weather.
The upper low will move inland Saturday for additional
precipitation. Ridging will nudge into the area later Sunday into
Monday. Troughing north of the area on Tuesday with a building
ridge expected Wednesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cool, cloudy conditions
across Western Washington this afternoon as an upper low south of
Vancouver Island slowly slides southward along the coast. A few
rain showers are being observed, mainly across the Olympic
Peninsula, as well as localized areas of southern Puget Sound.
Rain will increase along the Olympic Peninsula this evening into
tonight as the upper low meanders south offshore of the WA coast.
Although the thunderstorm threat is limited, NBM probabilities
suggest generally 15-25% along the Olympic Peninsula through
tonight.

The upper low looks to stall offshore of Oregon Thursday through
Friday morning with continued unsettled weather and more southeast
flow aloft. Widespread showers, and potential convection, looks
to develop over the southern Washington Cascades Thursday
afternoon into Thursday evening. Some of this activity is likely
to drift into portions of Puget Sound and Olympic Peninsula
Thursday night into Friday morning. At this time, thunderstorm
probabilities generally range 15-25% and peak over the Cascades,
however, will have to monitor this activity as well. Otherwise,
even cooler high temperatures are expected Friday in the 60s.

The upper low will move inland across the Pacific Northwest on
Saturday for continued showers, and perhaps more widespread QPF
Friday night into Saturday. Very cool temperatures will continue
on Saturday, with highs only in the low to mid 60s.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Troughing moves into the
interior Rockies on Sunday with some ridging influence building
offshore Sunday. Precipitation will likely dissipate on Sunday,
perhaps lingering into the mountains. Southwest flow increases on
Monday for generally drier conditions, although NBM precip
probabilities still range 15-30%, mainly along the Olympic
Peninsula, and Snohomish County northward with troughing
developing over British Columbia. Onshore flow increases Tuesday
with the aforementioned trough sliding north of the area and a
slight uptick in precipitation potential. Ensembles suggest
ridging builds offshore again Wednesday. Temperatures early next
week will be cooler than normal, with highs in the upper 60s to
mid 70s. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low will continue to move southward
along the coast, with south/southwesterly flow aloft. A weak front
will also cross through the region today, bringing light scattered
rain showers through the area. Current VFR/MVFR conditions, with light
shower activity starting alongside coastal terminals around
22z-03z, and starting to spread inland through 08z. There is still
a 15 to 25% chance of isolated thunderstorms at (KHQM, KCLM, and
KBLI). Confidence for inclusion in the TAF is still low at this
time.

Showers will be scattered in nature if they make it
through the interior terminals, although mostly all shower
activity will mainly stay confined to the coastal terminals this
evening. Expecting a mix of VFR/MVFR conditions this evening into
Thursday morning, with VFR likely through interior terminals. If a
shower goes over a terminal, could see fluctuations to MVFR/IFR
at times.

KSEA...VFR conditions at the terminal this afternoon with S/SW
winds generally around 5 to 10 knots. Light rain showers are
possible this evening after 00z at the terminal, but will likely keep
conditions at VFR, with a 10-15% chance of brief MVFR conditions 10z-15z.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A low pressure system will continue to drop southward
through the offshore waters through Thursday. A weak front will
brush through the coastal waters this afternoon, that may bring
showers and possibly an isolated thunderstorm or two over
portions of the area waters this evening. These storms could
bring gusty winds and low visibilities, especially in heavier
showers.

Additional systems look to move through the waters over the
weekend, which brings the potential for stronger onshore flow,
with small craft advisory westerlies down the Strait of Juan De
Fuca Friday night into Saturday. High pressure looks to rebuild
offshore through the coastal waters early next week with general
benign conditions.

Coastal seas will maintain 3 to 6 feet over the next several days.
