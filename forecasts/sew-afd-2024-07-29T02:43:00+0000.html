Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
743 PM PDT Sun Jul 28 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A wet weather system will move across the region
Monday into early Tuesday bringing cooler temperatures and rain
to the region. Showers will taper off through Tuesday. Drier
conditions and a warming trend are then expected through the rest
of the week, remaining well above normal into the weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Clouds are beginning to
increasing across Western Washington this evening as the long
advertised weather system that will produce some beneficial
measurable precipitation for the region approaches. As of 0230Z,
radar is already picking up echoes over the coastal waters and the
northwest corner of the Olympic Peninsula. Precip will spread to
interior areas late tonight into the morning hours of Monday.
Current forecasts are on track. Previous discussion follows with
updates to marine and aviation portions.  27

Marine layer stratus continues to burn off this afternoon and
temperatures are slowly rising where clearing is occurring.
Increasing high cirrus is likely as we get later into the afternoon
and evening ahead of a wet (for July) weather system.

That frontal system will begin to spread precipitation across the
coast late this evening and into the Puget Sound region early
Monday morning. This will likely result in slick commute
conditions across western Washington due to oil buildup and the
lack of recent rain. Precipitation totals over 0.50 inches are
possible along the Pacific coast as well as portions of the west
slopes of the Cascades. Lesser amounts of a few hundredths to a
quarter of an inch are possible for much of the greater Seattle
metro area down through Lewis County. Precipitation will become
showery and mainly limited to the mountains Tuesday as the system
progresses east.

By Wednesday, dry conditions are expected area wide as ridging
begins to fight against a wave moving though northern BC.
Temperatures are expected to rebound to the upper 70s to low 80s.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...By Thursday and Friday,
large scale ridging builds across the western CONUS allowing
temperatures to continue to warm reaching the 80s to around 90 in
the lowlands of western Washington by Friday afternoon. Details of
the pattern evolution over the weekend are still somewhat
uncertain. Additional dramatic warming appears unlikely, but
temperatures hovering in the 80s to low 90s is likely. Looking out
a bit further, above normal temperatures are favored into the
following week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West-northwest flow aloft with broad upper-level
troughing overhead. Widespread VFR conditions in place, however
already seeing clouds associated with incoming frontal system along
the coast an portions of the Olympic Peninsula. Will continue to see
clouds increase and cigs lower this evening and tonight before
widespread MVFR to IFR conditions emerge very late tonight/early
Monday morning. Showers expected to move in over W WA in the 12-14Z
timeframe and linger off and on throughout the day before scattering
out mid to late Monday afternoon. Even though precip tapers off,
MVFR to IFR cigs expected to persist for the remainder of the TAF
period.

KSEA...VFR conditions in place, albeit briefly. MVFR stratus
expected to return by 08-10z Monday and remain throughout the
remainder of the TAF period day. Southwesterly winds generally 5 to
10 knots, although some gusts are possible Monday afternoon with
FROPA.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure remains offshore with lower
pressure inland. A frontal boundary will cross the marine zones
Monday with showers but no significant winds are expected. High
pressure is expected to build over the coastal waters during the
second half of the week. Coastal seas 3 to 5 feet will persist for
the next several days.

.FIRE WEATHER...Benign fire weather conditions are expected for the
next few days. A front will enter and bring widespread rainfall
starting overnight tonight at the coast before spreading inland into
the day on Monday. Wetting rain (>=0.25") is possible for W WA
through Monday with the mountains likely to see the best chance
where up to 0.50-1.50" is expected for the Olympics and Cascades.
Locally higher amounts are possible. Conditions will then trend
drier as the week progress with upper-level ridging becoming more
prominent around Thursday-Friday. Here we could see above average
temperatures along with the possibility for critical RH values and
the threat for instability by the week`s end.
