Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
216 PM EDT Mon Jun 3 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>high pressure gradually builds down from New England through
midweek. High pressure moves out into the Atlantic Wednesday
night. A warm front approaches thereafter and moves within the
region Thursday. The warm front then moves north, leaving the
area with an approaching central area of low pressure for
Friday. The low meanders near the area going into the upcoming
weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM TUESDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cloud cover continues to slowly break up, especially away from
the coast. With ample sun, temperatures will once again rise
into the low to middle 80s for much of the area. Hi-res models
have backed off a bit on the potential for convection this
afternoon. So have removed any mention of showers or thunder.
Can not rule out a brief isolated shower, but the chances look
better south of our region.

Heights rise tonight behind the shortwave with ridging build
over the area. Lows tonight will be in the mid 50s to low 60s,
or near just to above normal for early June.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
Ridging aloft continues to shift east on Tuesday and Wednesday
with surface high pressure situated off to the north.

Dry on Tuesday with high pressure sliding down the New England coast
keeping fair weather conditions in place. The developing onshore
flow Tuesday will keep coastal locales a bit cooler than recent
days, with highs likely in the low to mid 70s during the
afternoon. Away from this influence, mainly the far interior and
areas west of the Hudson River, lower 80s is where temperatures
top out.

A vigorous shortwave rounding the base of a sprawling upper low
over Central Canada will eject into the Midwest midweek,
spelling an end to the relatively quiet pattern that has been
in place. Rain chances increase Wednesday afternoon and evening
with the approach of an associated warm front from the south and
west. While the bulk of the day appears dry, global ensembles
have trended a bit quicker with this WAA, and will need to continue
to monitor these trends. It`s just as possible however any wet
weather holds off until later Wednesday night. Temperatures on
Wednesday will be held down some by the increasing cloud cover
and persistent onshore flow, with highs in the 70s for most.

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
Main points

* Heavy showers and thunderstorms looking likely for Wednesday night
  into Thursday. Possibility for mainly minor flooding. See hydro
  section for more details.

* Periodic shower activity for Friday and into upcoming weekend.
  Possible thunderstorms at times as well.

* Temperatures will not depart much from normal values this time of
  year.

Synoptic pattern shows a transition from mid level ridge to a
longwave mid level trough that eventually closes off. The mid level
cutoff low then moves towards the local region towards the end of
the week and into the upcoming weekend. The base of the trough and
its axis potentially get within the local region by Sunday
night. This analysis is from the LREF grand ensemble.

Here is how the forecast changed compared to the previous forecast:

Temperatures no significant changes. Max temperature forecast lower
80s NYC and locations N&W Thursday and Friday. Min temperatures
forecast mid 50s to around 60 for much of area Friday night and
Saturday night, lower 60s for NYC.

POPs trended up Wednesday night, overnight, now into likely NYC and
locations N&W, overnight Wed night into early Thursday AM, 6-12Z
Thursday, likely POPs all forecast region 12-18Z Thursday, just
about entire area 18Z Thursday - 00Z Friday. Otherwise no
significant changes.

Despite marginal elevated instability in the Thursday into Friday
timeframe, there is potential for some low to mid level omega to aid
in vertical lift, so that is why there are higher chances of
thunderstorms and wanted to have higher than slight chance thunder.

&&

.AVIATION /18Z MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure along the New England coast strengthens tonight
and builds into the area by morning. The center of the high will
remain offshore on Tuesday.

Mainly a VFR forecast through Tuesday. A spotty shower is
possible this afternoon. There is some concern for shallow
low-level moisture to work in from the east overnight with the
possibility of a short period of IFR/LIFR ceilings. This would
be at the coastal terminals. However, confidence remains low and
plan to keep out of the forecast at this time.

A weak flow this afternoon will be enhanced by local seabreezes
at less than 10 kt. Elsewhere, expect a light E/SE flow to
develop if it hasn`t already. For tonight, winds will either be
light SE or light and variable, but then become easterly at 5
to 10 kt toward daybreak. Winds will veer to the ESE on Tuesday
at 7 to 10 kt.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Timing of afternoon seabreeze and wind shift to the SE may be
vary by 1-2 hours.

Low confidence of brief IFR/LIFR late tonight.

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

Tuesday Afternoon: VFR. Chance of IFR/LIFR in low clouds and fog
at night.

Wednesday: VFR during the day. MVFR or lower possible late day
into the night with chances of showers and thunderstorms.

Thursday: MVFR or lower possible in showers and thunderstorms,
mainly during the daytime hours.

Friday: Chance of MVFR with showers and possible thunderstorms.

Saturday: Chance of MVFR in showers.

&&

.MARINE...
Conditions will remain below SCA levels through late week with
seas on the ocean generally 3 ft or less.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
There are no hydrologic concerns through Wednesday.

With precipitable waters potentially approaching near 2 inches
Wednesday night into Thursday, some showers and especially any
thunderstorms could have heavy downpours. The potentially torrential
rain could cause minor flooding in low lying, urban and poor
drainage areas. With sufficient movement to showers and
thunderstorms, would think much of the flooding potential would be
minor.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
Coastal flood statement in effect for South Shore Bays, Southern
Nassau NY 4PM this afternoon to 8PM this evening. Coastal flood
statement in effect for Southern Westchester NY, Southern
Fairfield CT 8PM this evening to 12AM tonight. The indication
here seen in Stevens and ETSS indicates these locations are
touching or slightly exceeding minor coastal flood benchmarks
for this evening high tide.

With the approach of a new moon this week, astronomical levels will
be on the rise. With winds becoming more southerly and eventually
southeasterly, this will allow for increasing surge this week. As a
result, some locations especially across the Western LI Sound
and LI South Shore back bays may see minor coastal flooding,
starting with Monday afternoon`s high tide cycle and becoming
more widespread Tuesday night and Wednesday night.

Stevens guidance shows minor flood benchmarks being approached,
or exceeded by a few tenths for a few spots along southern
Nassau and the Western Sound. Thus, trends will need to be
monitored in subsequent cycles as minor coastal flooding will
become more likely for these areas Tuesday into Wed.

There is a low rip current risk through Tuesday due to low seas
on the ocean and winds mainly 10 kt or less.
