Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
305 PM PST Mon Feb 3 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low will continue to produce scattered
snow showers across western Washington, with a good chance of
snow accumulations tonight into Tuesday morning, and again on
Wednesday. Cold temperatures will remain in place through the
week, with Fraser River outflow and cool air in place from the
low dropping wind chills into the twenties for most areas. A
couple areas will see wind chills into the teens and single
digits, particularly in Whatcom County.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low
has continue to propagate southwestward off the coast of B.C. and
Washington. A surface low also sits underneath with some
baroclinicity in between the two. The jet stream will remains
funneled over southern WA/northern OR, with most of WA sitting in
the front left entrance region of the jet (good for support).
Down at the mid levels (around 500 mb), a vorticity maximum will
also swing through western WA around the low late this evening
tonight. While there are no organized fronts with this system, the
dynamics of this low, combined with cooler air enough, will be
enough to support snow showers at times through the week.

Radar this afternoon remains very active with a couple of
corridors of snow showers, and rain/snow showers across the
Pacific Coast, and the East Puget Sound Lowlands (with a few
showers in between these north/south corridors). HREF/WRF
ensembles depicted an increased confidence in light snowfall
accumulations for several areas tonight/Tuesday morning. The
highest confidence for accumulating snow remain areas around the
Olympics (Pacific Coast, Hood Canal, and Strait of Juan de Fuca
areas). East/northeast winds have been able to enhance snow
showers in at lot of these areas (upsloping with the Olympics).
Neah Bay has had seven inches of snow since earlier this weekend,
and additional 1 to 3 inches is likely in these areas (with
locally higher amounts possible for areas close/on the slopes of
the Olympics.

The attention now turns to an increasing chance of accumulating
snow in the Seattle metro from tonight into Tuesday morning.
HREF/WRF ensembles had a 70-80% chance of the Bremerton area
receiving at least 1 inch of snow (this drops to a 30-50% chance
for 2 inches of snow). For remaining Seattle areas, the confidence
is lower in exact snowfall accumulations (given the wide range of
potential outcomes due to discrepancies with wind direction and
QPF amounts). However, the probability of at least 1 inch of snow
ranged from 40 to 70% in areas from Tacoma up to Everett, and
also out to Bellevue and suburbs primarily south of I-90. Must
stress that given the showery nature of this precipitation, it
will be very difficulty to forecast exact amounts for specific
cities/localities, until showers develop. The timeframe for the
snow showers to pick up is later this evening into Tuesday
morning. Amounts will vary greatly, but where snow showers do
develop and entrain, amounts will range from a trace, up to an
inch (and a 20 to 30% chance of locally heavier amounts up to 2
inches). A winter weather advisory was issued for these areas from
5 pm this evening until 10 am Tuesday. An additional advisory was
issued for San Juans for the same time period. Remaining areas
will continue to see a chance of snow showers, but with
accumulations expected to be less than an inch.

Fraser River outflow has picked up (although with gradients not as
strong as initially forecasted). The worse of the cold air/wind
chills will continue to remain up in Whatcom County through
Wednesday morning, with wind chills dropping into the teens and
single digits next couple nights (thus continued the cold weather
advisory). For the San Juans/West Strait of Juan de Fuca areas and
North Coast, wind chill values will most likely drop into the 15
to 20 degrees ranged. The advisory was also reissued for these
areas tonight. Low temperatures were bumped up slightly for
tonight given the weaker Fraser River outflow, and to correct the
cold temperature bias of the NBM (trended towards the 75th
percentile). If the snow that falls tonight/Tuesday morning
sticks, this will lean low temperatures cooler for the next couple
nights. High temperatures will only make it into the mid and upper
30s each day, so any surfaces that freeze overnight will likely
thaw out during the day, before refreezing.

Another round of accumulating snow appears possible Wednesday
afternoon into early Thursday morning, with another vorticity max
and shortwave trough passing over the region. The highest
probability (greater than 50% chance) for over an inch of snow in
the lowlands is along the Pacific Coast, Chehalis Valley, Hood
Canal, and East Puget Sound Lowlands. Accumulating snow is also
expected in the Cascades and Olympics, but is expected to remain
light and below advisory thresholds at this time.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...The low is expected to move
inland on Friday in the ensembles, with flow aloft transitioning
to northwesterly aloft over the region. This will likely clear out
most precipitation chances this weekend (with precipitation
chances only at 20 to 40 percent). Low temperatures will improve
to around freezing for most urban areas, and highs improving to
the low 40s. There will likely be a mix of clouds and sun through
the weekend (even if showers do develop during this time).

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Broad upper level low over the Pac NW with moist W to
SW flow over western WA. The low level air mass is cool, moist and
slightly unstable with scattered showers over the region. The air
mass is cool enough for lowland snow showers across all of western
WA. Showers shift toward the coast on Tuesday as dry/east
(offshore winds) increase in the interior. 33

KSEA...Showers in the vicinity tonight with potential for MVFR
conditions in snow showers. Showers decreasing in coverage after
12z. Winds easterly around 10 kt, turning NE by 18-21z Tues. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Gusty NE/E Fraser River outflow winds continue through
Wednesday morning, impacting the Northern Inland waters,
central/west Strait of Juan de Fuca and adjacent Coastal Waters -
a Small Craft Advisory remains in effect. Offshore flow will
continue through the end of the week with low pressure over the
offshore waters and higher pressure east of the Cascades. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
