Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
238 PM PST Sat Mar 1 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft will allow for one more warm and
mostly sunny afternoon before unsettled weather with near-normal
temperatures returns to western Washington. A series of weak
troughs will bring chances for light showers Sunday through next
week with no significant impacts.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>As an upper level trough
deepens offshore, southwest flow aloft will maintain warmer
temperatures across much of western Washington today with high
temperatures across the interior peaking in the upper 50s and low
60s. Highs in the mid to upper 60s may even be possible in the
western Cascade valleys. Areas along the coast, however, have seen
continued low stratus with increasing high clouds throughout the
day that will limit temperatures.

As the next system approaches, clouds will continue to filter
inland this evening. Forecast models continue to develop a cutoff
low tonight that will dive southward throughout the day Sunday,
resulting in little more than scattered rain showers across
western Washington tonight through Sunday. The upper low will
shift inland over California on Monday, spreading wrap around
moisture northward for continued chances for light shower
activity. Between tonight and Monday, rainfall totals across the
lowlands will range between a few hundredths and two tenths of an
inch. The Cascades will see the best chances for precipitation
through Monday night, with slightly higher liquid totals up to
half an inch. Lingering moisture will likely cause rounds of low
stratus and patchy fog over the Puget Sound lowlands each morning.
Troughing will also bring temperatures back to near normal for
early March, in the upper 40s to low 50s. Snow levels will also
slowly lower to near 3500 ft by Monday night as temperatures cool,
resulting in an inch or two of snow accumulation over the higher
peaks.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...A weak transitory ridge
will allow conditions to briefly dry out early Tuesday before the
next system enters the region Tuesday afternoon. A trough will
lift a front across western Washington late Tuesday into Wednesday,
spreading another round of shower activity inland. Precipitation
amounts across the lowlands will once again be fairly light,
generally ranging between a tenth or two of rain. The mountains
will see increased moisture, nearing an inch over the Olympics and
Cascades. With snow levels near 3000 ft, the Cascade passes will
likely see light accumulating snow through Wednesday.

Forecast confidence decreases towards the second half of next
week, with potential for an atmospheric river to bring significant
moisture to the western US. However, models show a wide variety
of solutions with lots of uncertainty surrounding exactly where
the heaviest rainfall amounts will occur. Ensembles highlight wet
conditions by next Friday, with potential for periods of moderate
to heavy rain over the Olympic Peninsula and North Cascades into
next weekend.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridging/high pressure will give way to a
trough moving inland late today/Sunday. Flow aloft is southwesterly.
The trough will drag a weak cold front up to the coast
tonight/Sunday morning (it is expected to dissipate prior to coming
ashore).

This afternoon: nearly all low fog this morning has been replaced
with high clouds moving inland (VFR conditions except for a
lingering MVFR deck around Admiralty, and IFR ceilings along the
coast). Rain showers are expected to begin shortly after sunset, and
continue into Sunday. Ceilings are expected to decrease to low-end
MVFR/upper-end IFR (between 800 and 2,000 ft with lower ceilings in
the South Puget Sound/interior areas, and coast). They will remain
low with continuing showers/low-level moisture through the day. Mist
may lower visibilities at times with the shower activity. Winds are
light out of the west/southwest around 5 kt.

KSEA...VFR through the afternoon with high level clouds building in.
Expect lower ceilings down to MVFR after 06-08Z this evening and
remaining MVFR through all of Sunday (likely into Monday). There`s a
20% chance the ceilings drop low enough to IFR criteria. Light
showers are expected tonight/Sunday. Light winds out of the
southwest around 5 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure/ridging will give way to a trough
tonight/Sunday. Some lingering fog is clearing out of Puget Sound
this afternoon (as high clouds build in). A weak cold front is well
offshore with shower activity increasing in coverage. The front is
expected to collapse prior to arriving to shore tonight/Sunday
morning. Showers will spread more inland tonight/Sunday. Widespread
dense fog is not expected (due to lower cloud coverage), but cannot
rule out some mist with the showers potentially reducing
visibilities. Winds are expected to remain light across all seas
from now through next week, with winds changing between south and
north as the ridge/trough pattern continues through next week.

A small craft advisory continues for the coastal waters, and the
western Strait of Juan de Fuca for high seas (10 to 15 feet), which
will decrease below advisory threshold on Sunday down to 6 to 9 feet
through the end of the week.
