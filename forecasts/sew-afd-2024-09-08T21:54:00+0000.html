Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
254 PM PDT Sun Sep 8 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cooling trend has commenced across western Washington
today as an upper level trough swings across the Pacific Northwest.
Upper level troughing will remain the dominant influence across
the region through much of the week, bringing increased onshore
flow, below normal temperatures, and some shower chances at times.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery this
afternoon shows stratus has primarily scattered out across the
interior, but remains banked along the coast and across the
Southwest Interior this afternoon. Satellite also shows cirrus
streaming in overhead and smoke aloft still present across much of
the Sound and Cascades. The combination of cloud cover and smoke
aloft has taken a bit of a toll on temperatures this afternoon -
with most areas generally trending about 5 to 10 degrees cooler
than this time 24 hours ago. A few spots have been trending about
15 degrees cooler. Have brought highs down a few degrees this
afternoon as a result and have temperatures generally topping out
in the low to mid 60s along the coast, 70s across the interior,
and upper 70s to low 80s for the Cascades.

An upper level trough axis will swing across the area tonight
with flow aloft expected to become more zonal into Monday. This
will increase onshore flow and help bring a stronger marine push
into the region on Monday morning, with stratus looking to make it
well into the interior by the early morning hours. This will also
help push the remaining smoke aloft out of the region. Afternoon
high temperatures will be in the 60s along the coast and upper 60s
to 70s across the interior.

Another trough looks to approach the region Tuesday night and move
inland on Wednesday. Temperatures look to continue to trend
cooler each day, with highs expected to only top out in the 60s
areawide by Wednesday. This trough will also bring the next best
chance of more widespread shower activity to the region. While
QPF amounts remain rather light, there remains roughly a 15-25
percent chance of some spots across the area receiving a wetting
rain.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Latest guidance hints at a
quick break in between systems on Thursday as the aforementioned
trough exits the area to the east. Another trough looks to deepen
over the northeastern Pacific over the weekend and may bring some
light shower activity to portions of western Washington at times
through Sunday. General troughing will keep temperatures trending
below normal through the long term period. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West to Southwest flow over western WA, helping to

conditions. Stratus clouds will burn off by 18-21z in the interior
on Monday. 33
