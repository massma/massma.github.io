.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Fall like weather for the next few days. Upper level
low near Haida Gwaii this morning will move south ending up off
the Pacific Northwest coast tonight. The low will spin off the
coast Thursday into Friday before moving inland Friday night and
Saturday. A weak upper level ridge will try to build Sunday and
Monday. Another system will move by to the north Tuesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Satellite imagery shows upper
level low just south of Haida Gwaii this morning. System spinning
out of the low over Vancouver Island. Mostly cloudy skies over
Western Washington at 3 am/10z with temperatures in the 50s and
lower 60s.

Upper level low will continue to move south today and tonight
ending up off the Pacific Northwest coast late tonight. Front
associated with the low will weaken as it tries to move inland.
The southerly track of the low will make it hard for the front to
make much eastward progress but with the system close to the area
will have to go with a chance of showers for the entire area by
afternoon with showers likely along the coast. The chance of
showers inland with showers likely along the coast scenario will
continue tonight as the low continues to move south. Cloud cover
will keep highs well below normal, in the mid 60s to lower 70s.
Lows tonight in the mid and upper 50s.

Low spinning around Thursday and Thursday night with the center
of the low off the Oregon coast. South southeasterly flow aloft
will send bands of moisture through Western Washington keeping
showers in the forecast. Air mass becoming somewhat unstable of
the Cascades in the afternoon with lifted indexes below 0 and
convective temperatures near the daytime highs. Will have a slight chance
of thunderstorms in the Cascades Thursday afternoon. Highs again
be below normal, mid 60s to lower 70s with lows in the 50s.

Low starting to drift east Friday which will turn the flow aloft
more southeasterly. This will slightly increase the chances for
late day convection coming off the Cascades into the foothills.
For the remainder of the area Friday looking a lot like Thursday
with the low remaining to the south keeping at least a chance of
showers in the forecast.

Air mass becoming slightly unstable afternoon into the early
evening hours every day. There is a slight threat of thunderstorms
late in the day all three days but not enough to mention in the
forecast except for Thursday afternoon in the Cascades.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Upper level low moving off
to the east Saturday. Not much left of the low at this point but
will have to stay with a chance of showers forecast. Saturday
looks to be the coolest day in the next week with the low/coolest
air overhead. Highs remaining in the 60s. Operational model
solutions trying to build a weak upper level ridge into the area
Sunday and Monday but the ensembles are not as strong with this
feature keeping zonal over the area and weak systems moving by to
the north. Pretty rare to get measurable precipitation for a week
in the latter half of August. Have dried the southern portion
Monday with the ensembles showing only about 10 percent of the
solutions with measurable precipitation. Weak trofiness over the
area Tuesday for a slight chance of showers. Highs temperatures
remaining below normal Sunday through Tuesday, mostly in the mid
60s to lower 70s with some mid 70s Monday and Tuesday. Felton

.AVIATION...An upper level low will drop down into the region
today and continue to move southward along the coast tonight into
Thursday. Westerly flow aloft will gradually transition to more
southerly throughout the day. At the surface, a weak frontal
system will move inland along the coast and dissipate. Showers
associated with the front will gradually make their way into the
coast between 22-01Z. Light shower activity will be possible for
interior terminals tonight (mainly after 03Z) into Thursday.
There is a 15-25 percent chance for isolated thunderstorms today,
mainly for terminals along the coast (KHQM), Strait (KCLM), and
across the northern interior (KBLI). However, confidence for
inclusion in the TAF is too low at this time. Conditions mainly a
mixed bag of VFR and MVFR across the region early this morning,
however expect ceilings to lower to more widespread MVFR, or even
down to IFR, between 11-14Z. Most locations along the Sound should
see VFR conditions return by noon, while terminals along the
coast look to stay MVFR through much of the day. Winds generally
S/SW at 5-10 kt.

KSEA...MVFR conditions this morning. Expect conditions to
rebound to VFR near noon. Light showers possible tonight,
generally after 03Z. Winds S/SW, generally persisting at 5-10
kt. 14

&&

.MARINE...A low will drop down into the region today into
Thursday, bringing a weak frontal system to the coastal waters.
Showers and isolated thunderstorms will be possible across
portions of the area waters and could bring gusty winds and low
visibilities in any heavier rainfall today. Outside of any shower
activity, winds generally look to remain under 12 kt. Wind
direction will become more variable across the coastal waters
tonight into Thursday as the low moves southward through the
region. Additional systems will then move into the area waters
over the weekend, bringing the potential for stronger westerly
pushes through the Strait of Juan de Fuca. High pressure looks to
build back into the coastal waters and interact with lower
pressure inland by early next week for overall benign conditions.
Wave heights will generally range between 3-6 ft over the next
several days. 14

&&

.CLIMATE...The normal high in Seattle for the first week of fall,
September 22 to 28 this year, is 68 to 70 degrees. Felton
