Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
236 AM PDT Fri Oct 11 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge will provide dry conditions and a
gradual warming trend through the upcoming weekend. The ridge
will break down early next week for increasing chances of rain and
cooler temperatures as a series of frontal systems reach the
area.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High clouds cleared just
enough to afford much of Western Washington some excellent views
of the aurora overnight. After areas of low clouds dissipate
later this morning, considerable high cloudiness will continue
to spread across Western Washington today into tonight as an
upper level low cuts off well to our southwest. Upper level
ridging will strengthen over the upcoming weekend and the low
level flow will remain weakly offshore. This will lead to more
sunshine and a modest warming trend Saturday into Sunday. Areas
of low clouds will remain a fixture each morning as nights grow
longer and nighttime inversions set up. Weather conditions remain
favorable for those hoping to catch a glimpse of comet
Tsuchinshan-ATLAS before it dips below the horizon Saturday
evening.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Ensembles continue to
strongly support a sharp change in the longwave pattern next
week. Upper ridging over the interior West will finally give way
as it eventually does in autumn and a broad upper trough will dig
southward from the Gulf of Alaska. The first of a series of
frontal systems will spread precip onshore Monday afternoon into
Monday night. A more potent front will follow Tuesday into
Wednesday with some pretty healthy QPF and locally gusty winds.
An upper trough axis is slated to shift onshore by the middle of
the coming week with heights falling into the mid 540s dam and
snow levels tumbling to at or below 5000 feet. Showery conditions
are likely to continue into Thursday as the upper trough axis
remains overhead. By this time next week, it wouldn`t be
at all surprising to see some fresh snow on the ground at some of
the higher passes...(i.e. Stevens). The switch to the wet season
will be effectively be put in the "ON" position. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft will continue through Friday with
weak high pressure over the area and an upper low moving towards
OR/CA. Low stratus and areas of fog have developed east of Puget
Sound early this morning, as well as Olympia southwards. Generally
LIFR/IFR cigs have been observed in these areas. In addition, patchy
fog has developed towards KBLI. LIFR/IFR cigs are expected into this
morning for majority of Puget Sound, with generally high clouds for
the Olympia Peninsula. Lower vsbys will also be possible over Puget
Sound, mainly from 11-17z, with the low cigs. Cigs will improve
between 18-20z with VFR high clouds later in the afternoon and
evening. Light N/NE winds early this morning with light N/NW winds
for most this afternoon.

KSEA...LIFR/IFR cigs expected through this morning, with
improvements generally beginning between 18-19z. A period of lower
vsbys cannot be ruled out either, primarily around 12-17z with the
lower cigs. Cigs expected to improve to VFR high clouds by 19-20z,
and continue through the afternoon. Light N winds this morning will
become more NW this afternoon. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper ridge will continue into the weekend for Western
Washington, which will result in more of a north to offshore flow
pattern into Saturday. East winds will likely peak over the western
Strait of Juan de Fuca today, but remain below SCA threshold. Winds
will generally remain lighter for the interior waters through
Saturday. Southerly winds will begin to increase on Sunday with an
approaching front that will move through the area into Monday.
Although most areas are expected to remain SCA with the front Sunday
into Monday, there is approximately a 30 to 50% of SCA wind gusts
for the outer Coastal Waters during this period. Otherwise, a more
active weather pattern looks to return during the middle of next
week for periods of increased winds.

Seas of 3 to 5 feet will continue through Friday night. Seas will
then build 5 to 7 feet Saturday and Sunday. Seas will build further
Sunday night into Tuesday with the frontal system, likely reaching
10 to 13 feet on Monday before subsiding later Tuesday. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
