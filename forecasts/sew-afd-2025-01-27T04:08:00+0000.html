Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
808 PM PST Sun Jan 26 2025

.SYNOPSIS...An upper level ridge centered offshore will gradually
build into the region through the early portion of the week. This
will lead to dry conditions and chilly overnight temperatures.
The ridge will weaken by midweek and a series of systems will
bring a return of lowland rain and mountain snow Friday into the
weekend, with a threat of lowland snow late in the weekend.


&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No major changes have
been made to the forecast this evening as things are still stable.
The rest of the previous discussion can be found below with an
update to the aviation and marine sections.

High pressure at the surface and aloft continues to provide dry,
cool conditions across the area with light low level offshore
flow. Little change in the overall pattern is expected heading
into Monday with more chilly nights ahead and sunny, cool days.
Surface gradients will be lighter and this will contribute to a
little more patchy freezing fog/low clouds across the Southwest
Interior and Puget Sound the next couple mornings. The upper ridge
begins to weaken and get suppressed southward Tuesday into
Wednesday as a system rides over the top of it into north/central
British Columbia. This will begin the process of opening the door
to a series of systems reaching Western Washington at the end of
the week.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Unsurprisingly, the models
are pushing back the arrival of the first front a smidge. Current
model timing generally agrees with bringing rain to the coast
late Thursday night and spreading precip across the interior
Friday morning. The front looks to stall a bit offshore before
getting shoved inland Friday night with rain and a solid shot of
mountain snow. Beyond this, the models crucially began to diverge
with respect to the depth and track of the trailing upper trough.

As discussed yesterday, this continues to have significant
implications in terms of both precip type and amounts moving into
the Saturday night and Sunday period. Taking a closer look at
both ensemble meteograms and NBM output, snow probabilities are
beginning to rise sharply by Sunday. The NBM now shows a 50-60%
probability of a fraction of an inch of snow by Sunday afternoon
over the entirety of lowland Western Washington. Those
probabilities fall to 25-35% for an inch. But given these numbers
7 days out, it`s becoming quite apparent that we`ll need to be
watching this evolving scenario closely in the days ahead. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge will remain centered offshore
through Monday with northerly flow aloft. In the lower levels
offshore gradients will weaken slightly into Monday. Skies will
remain mostly clear with a few cumulus clouds and a chance of patchy
freezing fog in the Southwest Interior and sheltered river valleys
from 12Z-16Z, reducing visibility to less than a mile. Winds will be
light under 5 kt tonight (light and variable in some spots), picking
back up to 4 to 8 kt Monday out of the north.

KSEA...Clear/VFR skies expected in the TAF forecast. Fog is not
expected over the terminal Monday morning (but may be outside of the
vicinity to the southwest of the terminal towards Tacoma and the
Kitsap Penninsula). Winds will decrease under 5 kt tonight out
the north, and increase to 4 to 8 kt Monday. Felton/HPR<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...Surface high pressure over the offshore waters and
over Eastern Washington with a weak surface trough along the coast
through Tuesday. Both areas of high pressure will weaken Wednesday
and Wednesday night. Next front moving through the waters Thursday
night and Friday morning. Possible small craft advisory winds with
the front over the coastal waters. Felton

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No river flooding is expected over the next 7 days.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
