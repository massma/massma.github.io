Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
843 AM PST Tue Dec 31 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A break in the weather is expected today, but will be
short lived as the next system will arrive tonight into Wednesday.
Another series of systems will arrive beginning later in the week
and into the weekend for more rain, mountain snow and breezy
conditions.

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>It`s a fairly quiet morning across the region today. The
main item of concern in the near term is the potential for a
rain-snow mix or brief snow on the higher hills across the region
as well as in the Hood Canal area overnight tonight into early
Wednesday morning. This is detailed well in the previous
discussion below. The current forecast is on track an no updates
are planned this morning.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Short wave ridging will
allow for conditions to quiet down somewhat today, with partly
cloudy skies for much of the day. The reprieve from more active
weather will be short, as a weaker front will move through tonight
into Wednesday morning. The next system does not appear to be
particularly robust in moisture, with only around a tenth to
quarter of an inch of rain expected in the lowlands, and two to
five inches of new mountain snow likely.

Temperature wise, given that some colder, but drier air is
entering the region, the NBM mean still seemed somewhat high for
this morning`s lows. Therefore, a nudge closer to the 50th
percentile was used to bring the temperatures throughout the
lowlands into the upper 30s. The colder air will linger as the
next front moves through tonight, and because of this, a brief
rain/snow mix can`t be ruled out in the higher elevations of the
east Puget Sound lowlands, and the eastern Olympic
Peninsula/Hoodsport area late tonight. The dynamics will be most
supportive of some snow flakes mixing in given that the wetbulb
temperatures are above freezing, and a more moderate to heavy
shower helps force the freezing level down a bit to support the
mix. The period of any possible mixed precipitation will be
short, and given that surface temperatures are still warm, no
accumulation or many areas of slick surfaces are expected.

The bulk of the front will swing through the area on Wednesday
morning, keeping scattered showers in its wake. By early afternoon
on Wednesday, much of Puget Sound may be drier, with only light
showers ongoing in the Cascades. Another shortwave ridge will
attempt to build in Wednesday night into Thursday, with a warmer
air profile accompanying it. Thursday also looks drier at this
point, but the next system is still forecast to arrive on Friday.

Another round of perigean spring tides is forecast to start on
Wednesday, and with additional storm systems coming into the area
later in the week, the threat for coastal flooding will need to be
monitored. At the time of this writing, no site appeared to be
crossing critical coastal flooding thresholds, but this is subject
to change.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Models are persistent on a
more robust system moving into the region on Friday, but the
bigger question right now lies in the track it will take. Some
solutions take it into Oregon, others into British Columbia. This
would of course have a big impact on how much rain is forecast to
fall in western Washington. While this is something to be
monitored, at this point, rain in the lowlands on the order of
half to three quarters of an inch of rain is expected, with over
an inch on the windward side of the Olympics. Additional mountain
snowfall totals across the passes range from six to fourteen
inches of snow.

Active weather is expected to continue into the weekend and early
next week with rain, snow and wind all in the extended forecast.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow aloft as an upper level ridge moves
into W WA today, shifting to the southwest late this afternoon as
the ridge axis pushes further inland. Majority of stations reporting
southerly surface winds with some variation to the southwest or
southeast, speeds running generally 4-8 kts. The remainder are
generally light and variable. More easterly to southeasterly winds
expected by late morning with speeds increasing slightly to 5-10 kts.

Cigs are mixed over W WA this early morning. Majority of locations
do fall under VFR conditions, however locations along the south and
western sides of the Sound /OLM, PWT/ largely LIFR with fog.
Improvement to mostly widespread VFR conditions late this morning or
early this afternoon with improved mixing ahead of approaching weak
frontal system. Once rain associated with this feature enters the
area, cigs erode somewhat, with terminals still generally remaining
in either VFR or high-end MVFR.

KSEA...VFR conditions in place currently and lasting into the
afternoon and early tonight before cigs erode with incoming precip
during the overnight hours. Southerly flow turning more
southeasterly by 12Z, then turning easterly for the late morning and
through the afternoon before returning to southeasterly this
evening. Speeds, as mentioned above, remaining generally 4-8 kts.

.MARINE...High pressure moving eastward will allow the next system
to impact the coastal waters today, boosting speeds into the low-end
SCA range. As such, inherited headline remains in effect there.
These east to southeasterly winds will also allow borderline SCA
winds in the East Strait, again warranting no alteration to
inherited headline there. These locations should see speeds diminish
below criteria late tonight. Otherwise, forecast looks largely
uneventful until mid-week, where more active weather is expected.

Seas 5-7 ft increasing to 6-9 ft by this evening, holding there
through Wednesday...which will see another rise to 9-11 ft. This has
the potential to yield seas-driven SCAs, but at this time, will
continue to monitor.

Another system is expected to move over the coastal waters on
Friday, bringing another chance of small craft criteria winds and
waves between 8 to 12 ft. Waves should decrease below 10 ft on
Sunday night.

.HYDROLOGY...An active weather pattern will promote additional
rounds of lowland rain across western Washington throughout the
week. Late Thursday into Friday, a warmer system looks to bring
4000 to 5000 ft snow levels to the Olympic Peninsula basin.
Additional precipitation associated with the system may bring the
Skokomish River closer to minor flood stage again.
