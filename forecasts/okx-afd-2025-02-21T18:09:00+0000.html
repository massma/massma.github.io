Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
109 PM EST Fri Feb 21 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure builds today into the weekend, then moves
offshore Sunday night into Monday. A warm front passes nearby to
the north during Monday, followed by a cold front moving through
here Tuesday into Tuesday night. Weak high pressure then
briefly returns for Wednesday before low pressure affects the
region on Thursday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The forecast is mainly on track with the minor updates made
earlier today.

Low pressure exits far to the northeast at the surface as a trough
aloft begins to move offshore and farther east into the Atlantic
tonight. At the same time, high pressure builds towards us from the
interior.

A few clouds may linger into the early morning, but quickly
clear as dry air filters in leading to a mainly sunny afternoon
and night.

Mostly sunny today, and an increased pressure gradient between
high and low pressure will leave us under gusty NW flow until
the winds gradually lessen tonight as the pressure gradient
weakens due to high pressure moving in. Peak gusts this morning
into this afternoon will be around 40 mph. Should lose all
gusts before daybreak Saturday.

Temperatures remain cold, with highs today in the upper 20s to
around freezing. Maximum wind chills reach the teens to low 20s
this afternoon. Low temperatures tonight drop into the teens to
near 20. Given some breezy weather may remain, at least early
in the night, minimum wind chills will be in the single-digits.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
High pressure settles in over the weekend. A few weak, moisture-
starved shortwaves aloft are hinted at in some global and regional
guidance. This may keep partly cloudy skies around for the weekend,
but will not lead to any precip.

Temperatures will be on a warming trend this weekend as winds turn
SW. Highs Saturday reach the mid/upper-30s. Highs Sunday reach the
upper-30s to mid-40s. Saturday night low temperatures will
range from the low/mid-20s in the interior and the LI Pine
Barrens to around 32 in the NYC metro.

&&

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...
Key Points:

* Above normal temperatures expected Monday through Thursday.
  Highs Monday in the mid and upper 40s, and generally upper 40s
  Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. A few locations could reach the
  lower 50s in metro NE NJ and NYC.

* Mainly dry conditions are expected through mid week.

* A more organized low pressure system may impact the area late next
  week.

The upper flow will be mainly zonal Sunday night into Monday with
surface high pressure remaining in control. A more amplified trough,
accompanied with a vort max, passes mainly to the north Monday
night, quickly followed by another trough and vort max for Tuesday
into Tuesday night. Still with some uncertainty with the timing,
strength, and areal coverage of the systems have maintained
generally slight chance probabilities Monday night through Tuesday
night.

A more highly amplified trough approaches for Thursday into Thursday
night. There remains some uncertainty with the interaction of a
southerly low moving off the southeastern coast, and the track that
this low and a northern stream low will take. Precipitation is
expected to be mainly rain with warm air surging northward ahead of
the trough, and then possibly ending as some light snow as the
system exits Thursday night into Friday.
