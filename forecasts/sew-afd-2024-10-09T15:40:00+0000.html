.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Off and on showers again today as an upper level
trough passes through Western Washington. Upper level ridging will
bring drier conditions and warming temperatures starting Thursday
and continuing into the weekend. Another shift to cooler and wet
weather is expected early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Remains mostly cloudy across western Washington this
morning with a front east of the Cascades, and a trough just off
of Vancouver Island moving east. Few light showers continue in the
Cascades and along the coast this morning, and coverage is still
expected to increase into scattered shower clusters. Best chances
for these will be along the coast, and from Snohomish County up
to the Canadian border.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Some scattered weak echoes
present on current radar imagery and ground obs suggesting that
these are producing some very light showers or drizzle this early
morning. Latest water vapor imagery shows the upper level trough
expected for today still a bit off to the west, out over the Pacific
waters, with a band of dry air to the south of it. That pronounced
feature will factor into the forecast this afternoon, when shower
chances move inland...but mainly focusing on the northern half of
the CWA. Even if showers are not a threat to the entire area, the
clouds will keep temps cool, with highs today generally in the lower
to mid 60s.

This trough does not dally, ejecting by this evening and ridging
building throughout the day Thursday. Deterministic models, ensemble
members and even the NBM are all in lock-step here...keeping
conditions dry throughout the remainder of the short term period.
Daytime highs will be a little sluggish to react to this feature at
first with temps Thursday only a degree or two warmer than today.
Friday will see temps shift warmer, with highs in the mid to upper
60s.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Continued agreement in
solutions for Saturday and into Sunday as the upper level ridge and
dry conditions continue to hold court over W WA. Daytime highs
during this period will remain 5-9 degrees warmer than climo ranging
in the mid 60s to lower 70s.

For the start of next week, models seem to be agreeing on the
general trend...if not the specifics. GFS is slowest to bring in the
next system...waiting until Tuesday morning while ECMWF and
ensembles lean more toward a Monday afternoon/evening start. The
overall troughy pattern this front will usher in will keep western
Washington under varying chance of showers for at least the
remainder of the forecast period...possibly further. High temps
Monday will initiate the cooling trend...albeit slightly...with
daytime highs mainly in the mid 60s to near 70. Tuesday sees more
significant cooling with temps finally getting back to their
seasonal normals...ranging from the upper 50s to mid 60s.
