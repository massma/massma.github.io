Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak front will cross the region this evening,
bringing some light rain as it slides eastward. Cooler conditions
linger through Wednesday as the trailing upper trough shifts
through. A stronger system follows Friday to bring more widespread
rain across the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak frontal band is
progressing eastward across the region this afternoon, continuing
to bring increased cloud cover across Western Washington. Some
light rain is expected but amounts will be relatively light and
the bigger sensible impact will be the cooler temperatures that
remain into Wednesday as the upper trough slides through. Expect
clouds to linger and maybe some light rain in the far north. Weak
high pressure builds on Thursday will could bring some morning fog
in the river valleys and other sheltered location. Otherwise,
temperatures hold near or slightly below normal during the day and
morning lows dip into the lower 40s or upper 30s.

Expect a shift in the pattern as ensemble guidance suggests the
ridge over the western U.S. will begin to shift a little eastward,
opening the door to the arrival of the next frontal system. This
will likely bring more widespread rain chances with up to a half
inch or so expected in the coast and into the mountains. Not a
hydrologically significant system at this point in the season by
any stretch, but still a good bit of rain. Temperatures will again
cool a bit as this system passes with daytime highs in the upper
50s to around 60.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Ensemble guidance
continues to support some weak ridging building across the Pacific
Northwest into the weekend, bringing a drier trend for most.
However, there is a cluster of ensemble solutions that suggest a
weak trough could maintain at least some light rain chances. This
would be especially the case in the mountains and along the far
northwest portions of the area. Otherwise, still no significant
signal for a notable weather event during the early start of next
week with increasing spread in the pattern by Monday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Flow aloft will continue to remain westerly with
northerly offshore low level flow. A weak cold front will bring
resulting in light showers some increased clouds. Ceilings -
especially over the north have been a mixed bag - ranging from IFR
to above 3000 feet. These should improve as the front passes and
weakens. For the remainder of the area conditions should remain
VFR with a chance of periods of light showers into the early
evening. Generally light surface winds have picked up over the
last hour or so - out of the north/northwest for the metro/Puget
Sound terminals, and west/southwest for the most of the
remaining terminals. Winds are expected to ease later this evening
at times becoming variable.

KSEA...VFR conditions with increasing mid and high
level clouds. Light showers still a possibility, if they do
occur they would be brief with no impact around 23-00Z. Variable
to northerly winds 6-9 kts as the weak front transits late this
afternoon and early evening, becoming northeast and easing to 4-6
kts. There is 30-60% chance of a period of ceilings below 3000 feet
late this evening, otherwise conditions should remain VFR overnight
into Wednesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak cold front passing through interior waters this
afternoon and early evening with light showers mainly over northern
waters. Seas remain the main issue - building to 9 to
14 feet beginning in the northern outer coastal waters and
spreading to all zones Tuesday evening through all of Wednesday
night/Thursday morning. Onshore flow will pick up behind the front,
with gusty winds reaching the central/east Strait of Juan de Fuca
late Tuesday night/Wednesday morning with small craft
advisories for the seas/winds.

The flow will become more northerly Thursday with riding building in
southern British Columbia. Another disturbance is possible Friday
but predictability of hazards are too low at this time. Seas will
drop gradually down to 4 to 6 feet Thursday/Friday, building back to
5 to 7 feet towards the end of the week.
