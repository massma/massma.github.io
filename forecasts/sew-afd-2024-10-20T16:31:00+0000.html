Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
931 AM PDT Sun Oct 20 2024

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A relatively warmer morning with continued southerly
winds ahead of a cold front that will move across Western
Washington today. Steadier rain offshore will move east over the
Olympic Peninsula late morning and slide into the interior this
afternoon. Winds have already increased this morning, with gusts
of 45 MPH at Whidbey Island as well as gusts in the mid 30s along
the north coast, where a Wind Advisory continues. No major
forecast updates this morning.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A front will move across the area today, bringing
another round of breezy winds and heavier rain to the region.
Expect additional showers and cooler conditions Monday as an upper
trough pushes east across the region. Drier conditions develop
toward midweek, but rain returns late in the week as a more active
pattern returns.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The plume of moisture that
has been responsible for heavy rainfall across the northwestern
portions of the area (and even more so north of the border)
remains draped in place across the region. Rainfall rates have
diminished a bit early this morning across the local area as the
stronger moisture transport has again shifted north. However,
expect the cold front to move inland across Western Washington
later today as the surface low then approaches. This will bring
another round of steadier rain, likely around 1-2" in the
mountains and around 0.50-1.00" in the lowlands. This will
maintain elevated flows on some local rivers, especially those
draining from the Olympic Peninsula and the North Cascades. See
the Hydrology section for additional details.

One other note for the areas along the Pacific coast - higher than
average high tides have lead to water levels near minor coastal
flooding thresholds at La Push and Westport the last few days, and
there`s some concern that we`ll have one more day today with the
afternoon high tide of again approaching or reaching criteria.
While the astronomical tide is slightly lower today than
yesterday, lower pressure and higher surge contributions may keep

In addition to the rain, we`ll also see another round of gusty
winds ahead of the front. The wind advisory remains unchanged for
the northern coast as well as areas around Admiralty Inlet north
through the San Juan Islands and western Whatcom and Skagit
counties. Wind gusts may reach 40-45 mph for a few hours in
southerly winds ahead of the front in these locations. This may be
sufficient to again bring some localized power outages or damage
to trees as the winds push through. Elsewhere, impacts are
expected to be much more spotty at most, but winds will remain
breezy across the region again today. The front will push inland
and east of the Cascades late today, with a likely Puget Sound
Convergence Zone forming into the evening. This may also be
accompanied by a push of westerly winds through the Strait of Juan
de Fuca that could extend across Whidbey Island for lingering
gusty winds into the evening hours.

The trailing upper trough slides overhead into Monday, ushering in
a cooler air mass. This will bring temperatures some 10 degrees
cooler than Sunday, with many locations only reaching the mid
50s. Some lingering moisture will likely maintain showers across
the area, especially in the mountains. Snow levels will fall with
the colder air arriving to around 4,500 ft or so, but moisture
should be quite limited by the time the snow levels fall closest
to the Cascade passes. Decreasing showers into Tuesday as heights
begin to rise over the region as a deeper low develops well
offshore over the eastern Pacific.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Dry weather continues to
start the midweek period with higher pressure aloft setting over
the region for a couple of days. This could bring a good setup for
efficient radiational cooling each morning, bringing the
potential for temperatures to drop into the mid 30s with pockets
of frost possible in the outlying areas Wednesday and Thursday
mornings. Expect the higher pressure to break down late in the
week, opening the door for renewed precipitation chances as the
next disturbance crosses into the western U.S.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Strong west flow aloft with several systems moving over
western Washington. A surface cold front currently sitting over the
coastal waters will quickly work its way westward across the area
late this morning into this afternoon. Currently most terminals are
VFR, with MVFR conditions and lower across the northwestern portions
of the area and the Pacific coast (CLM, BLI, HQM).

Moderate to heavy rain will be possible (especially at northern and
coastal terminals) reducing visibilities and ceilings down to
MVFR/IFR. Gusty winds out of the south are expected later today.
Sustained winds of 10-25 kt with gusts to 30-40 kt are expected late
this morning and afternoon as the front sweeps from west to east.
This will be a concern for possible LLWS ahead of the frontal
passage.

A return to high-end MVFR to VFR conditions are expected for most
following the frontal passage and going into early tonight before
ceilings lower area-wide to MVFR through the early morning. Winds
will also ease tonight back to 5 to 10 kt.

KSEA...VFR conditions this morning. Rain showers will arrive 21Z
along with windy conditions (southwest winds 10-20 kt gusting to 30
kt) as a cold front passes through. Winds will die down later
tonight with potential for lower ceilings Monday morning.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front situated just offshore will move west across
the coastal waters this morning into early this afternoon. Heavy
rain may reduce visibility at times as the front moves through.
All waters are under small craft advisories, timed with when the
strongest winds will arrive over each specific zone. For the coastal
waters: expect the strongest winds (20-30 kt gusting to 35 kt) to
arrive late this morning into the afternoon, along with waves of 9
to 12 feet. For the Strait of Juan de Fuca: east winds will pick up
late this morning in the western portion of the strait. Stronger
winds (20-30 kt gusting to 35 kt) in the west/central strait will
arrive later this afternoon and continue through late Sunday
evening. The east strait (along with the Northern Inland, Admiralty
Inlet, and Puget Sound Zones) will see southerly winds of 20-30 kt
pick up late this morning, and veer to the west this afternoon.

High pressure will build offshore with low pressure inland on
Monday, creating quiet onshore flow over most of the waters. The
potential exists for the next system to move into the area Friday
into next weekend (but it remains too early at this time to
highlight the potential for any hazards). Seas will drop to 4 to 6
feet Monday through next weekend, and potentially build back up to 6
to 8 feet then.

HYDROLOGY...Rivers are cresting, or slowly receding this morning
following the atmospheric river that brought heavier rainfall
totals across the Olympic Peninsula and portions of the Cascades
over the last 36 hours. A front will move across Western
Washington today for additional precipitation, with amounts
generally ranging 0.50-1.50" for the Olympics and Cascades.
Although brief rises can be expected on area rivers following this
front, flooding is not expected given this will be a relatively
quick moving period of rainfall. The Bogachiel River, which
reached Minor Flooding Saturday evening, continues to recede this
morning. The other rivers that are specifically being monitored
this morning are the Nooksack River at Ferndale, as well as
Skokomish River at Potlach. However, river flooding is not
expected with the additional rainfall today. Some showers linger
into Monday, but should not be sufficient to cause additional
flooding Drier conditions toward midweek will allow rivers to
level off and recede.
