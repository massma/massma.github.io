Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
1258 PM EST Mon Jan 27 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
Low pressure moves through southeast Canada into tonight,
dragging a cold front through on Tuesday. Another clipper low
passes through Tuesday night into Wednesday. High pressure then
gradually builds in from the west through Thursday. Low pressure
may impact the region Friday into the first half of the weekend
before another front pushes it out to sea. Canadian high
pressure builds in for Sunday.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Forecast on track this afternoon. High pressure then continues
to weaken as a strong 970mb surface low moves through southeast
Canada. While the low will pass well north of the area, winds
gradually increase and back to the southwest in response to the
tightening pressure gradient. Sustained winds at 15 to 20 mph
with gusts around 25 mph expected this afternoon.

Plenty of subsidence through the column today will allow for sunny
skies. Highs will be in the upper 30s to low 40s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
As mentioned, strong low pressure will pass well to our north, but
it will drag a cold front through our area on Tuesday. Winds ahead
of that front continue to strengthen tonight. A strong LLJ forms
late this evening, with the axis roughly oriented from just south of
Long Island, up through eastern Suffolk County and then into RI and
Cape Cod. Latest guidance continues to show 40 to 45 knots at 950mb.
The NAM still shows the strongest LLJ with 45 to 50 knots at 950mb,
but this is an outlier. Over the relatively warmer waters there is
high confidence tonight of 40+ knot gusts making it to the
surface with forecast soundings showing mixing up to 925mb+,
but with an expected inversion over land, gusts likely stay
below wind advisory criteria. Across eastern Suffolk County and
southeastern CT, gusts up to 40 mph are expected, with isolated
45+ mph gusts possible. Elsewhere, gusts will range from 25 to
35 mph. After sunrise Tuesday, while the strong LLJ will push
east, deep mixing will allow for widespread 35 mph gusts. There
is still some uncertainty with exactly when the cold front moves
through, but it will likely be sometime in the late morning or
early afternoon on Tuesday. The best chances for any
precipitation with this front will be across the interior, but
slight chance PoPs extend down to the coast. This would fall as
light rain or snow showers depending on location. Some of the
activity could be more in the form of squalls, but the bulk of
this activity is expected to stay north and west of the area.
This potential will continue to be monitored as guidance does
show very weak SBCAPE values with decent low level
frontogenesis resulting in non-zero snow squall parameter values.
Regardless, any snow that does fall would likely not result in
more than a dusting.

Weak high pressure briefly builds in for the start of Tuesday night,
but will quickly be followed by a clipper low diving down from the
northwest. This system will once again bring gusty winds to the area
as well as rain and snow showers. The best chances for any
accumulation will be across the interior, but will once again be
light. Current forecast has up to half an inch of snowfall across
eastern CT.

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
A cold front that moved through Wednesday night will push farther
south on Thursday. Though with timing differences in models, the
front may still be within the forecast area Thursday morning. High
pressure builds in behind the front while an upper level trough off
the coast of New England pushes east.

The front lifts back north as a warm front Thursday night as low
pressure over southern Canada moves east across northern New England
into Friday, and weakens as it does so. Meanwhile, a more potent low
over the Mid-West moves toward the region Thursday night. This low
may impact the region as early as Friday evening, but there is a
great deal timing and placement differences, so stuck close to NBM
in regards to POPs.

Eventually, a cold front moves through from the northwest, pushing
the low out approaching the area from the Mid-West out to sea Sunday
morning, and high pressure builds in for the rest of Sunday. This
could end up suppressing the low to the south of the forecast area,
and we would be on the northern fringes of the low.

Temperatures and precipitation types during this time frame is
highly dependent on exactly where the fronts will be. For now,
expect slightly below normal temperatures on Thursday, slightly
above normal for Friday as the warm front lifts north of the area,
then back down to near normal on Saturday and slightly cooler for
Sunday.

.AVIATION /18Z MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak high pressure remains in place today, then a cold front
approaches tonight and moves through on Tuesday.

VFR. W-SW winds around 15kt will gust to around 25kt this
afternoon into the evening. The gusts are forecast to continue
through the overnight, however, can not rule out the gusts
subsiding for a few hours. Winds become more W-NW Tuesday
morning with speeds around 20kt, with gusts 30-32kt.

LLWS from 00Z to 09Z tonight at 2 kft from the SW at 50 kt.

     NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Gusts may be occasionally higher than forecast.

.OUTLOOK FOR 18Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

Tuesday afternoon: Mainly VFR. WNW 15-25 kt, gusts around 30
kt, with chc 35 kt along the coast. Winds subside PM.

Wednesday: Chance of MVFR or lower in light snow, especially across
the northern terminals. WSW gusts around 25 kt.

Thursday: VFR. NW gusts 20-25 kt Thursday.

Friday and Saturday: Sub-VFR in rain.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Winds increase this afternoon and peak tonight through Tuesday.
The Gale Warning now includes all waters except the western LI
Sound and NY Harbor and starts at 6 PM. Ahead of the gales, a
Small Craft Advisory has been issued for all waters starting at
1 PM for 25 kt wind gusts.

For the gale warning, 35 to 40 kt gusts are expected, with a few
isolated gusts up to 45 kt possible for the far eastern LI Sound and
eastern ocean zone. Given the strong winds, seas on the ocean likely
reach 7 to 10 feet, with waves on the Sound reaching 4 to 6
feet.

Winds and waves briefly lower below SCA criteria Tuesday night
before increasing again Wednesday into Wednesday night with the
passing of a clipper low. There is potential for gales once again,
mainly on the ocean waters. Confidence is low at this time and will
leave out of the HWO.

SCA conditions on the ocean waters for Thursday as waves 4 to 8 ft
diminish through the day, possibly dropping below 5 ft for most of
the ocean waters by Thursday evening as high pressure builds in over
the waters. Waves increase to above 5 ft late Thursday night from
Fire Island to Montauk Point as low pressure approaches from the
west and remain above 5 ft through the day Friday and possibly at
least the first half of Friday night.

Winds will largely be below 25 kt across the non-ocean waters
through the period, though occasional gusts to 25 kt are possible.
Winds of 25 to 30 kt over the ocean early Thursday morning diminish
by late morning or early afternoon, but increase to around 25 kt
once again late Thursday night into Friday diminishing Friday
night.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
