Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
914 AM PST Mon Nov 25 2024

.SYNOPSIS...An upper-low continues to churn off the PNW coast as
Monday brings active weather. Conditions will settle towards the
Thanksgiving holiday as guidance hints at the return drier weather
but cooler temperatures.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A look outside the window
here at NWS Seattle shows a standard gray, wet, murky day that one
typically associates with November in the PacNW. Latest satellite
imagery shows plenty of low clouds in place over the CWA, shoring up
the belief that things are gloomy all over, not just here on the
shores of Lake Washington. Switching over to radar, there are two
areas of interest: first a line of showers stretching from Mason
county west-southwestward out over the Pacific waters and the second
a rather sizable blob over the east Sound stretching from northern
King county up into Skagit county. Both of these are moving
northeasterly but at a rather slow pace.

Soupy conditions expected to be present for much of the day today as
the upper level low that has been responsible for recent active
weather stretching all the way back into last week finally decides
to pick up sticks and slowly move eastward. This will allow the
system to continue to funnel moisture into the area and as such keep
PoPs going for much of the day today and into tonight. Model
solutions /both ensemble and deterministic/ favor the low itself
tracking south of the area as it moves further inland. While some
lingering showers may be possible overnight and into Tuesday
morning, this shift in trajectory will take most of the moisture out
of the area, allowing for the forecast to begin to dry out as upper
level ridging builds into W WA Tuesday night into Wednesday.

Daytime highs in the short term will technically be on a bit of a
cooling trend, although most locations will only see about a degree
of cooling...if that...each day. Temp ranges will remain in the mid
to upper 40s. Overnight lows tonight and Tuesday night will remain
pretty similar, ranging in the upper 30s to lower 40s, however once
the ridge starts building in, lows will cool ranging in the lower to
mid 30s.

Inherited forecast looks on track. No morning updates planned at
this time.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...From Previous
Discussion...Slight PoPs will remain  in the forecast. This can be
attributed to another subtle shortwave breaking off the ridge
centered over the NE PAC, entering around Thursday-Friday. Guidance
appears to have upper-level ridging as the dominate feature into the
weekend. Cool overnight lows are likely during this forecast period.
And with longer nights and residual surface moisture, patchy fog is
possible as well.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak upper level low off the Oregon coast drifting
east moving inland over Southern Oregon Tuesday morning. Southerly
flow aloft becoming light. Light flow in the lower levels as well.

Weak system moving out of the area this morning. IFR ceilings and
visibility with the feature from about KPAE northward until 20z.
Conditions slightly improving behind the feature with MVFR ceilings
lifting to VFR 21z-00z. With the light low level flow ceilings
lowering back down to IFR 09z-12z tonight with local LIFR ceilings
and visibility 12z-18z Tuesday morning.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings and visibility improving to VFR 20z-22z.
Ceilings lowering back down to MVFR after 06z and to IFR ceilings
with possible reduced visibility ( 3-5sm ) 12z through most of
Tuesday morning. Southeast wind 6 knots or less becoming variable
after 00z. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak low to the southwest will maintain generally light
winds as it meanders around offshore today before pushing inland and
falling apart tonight. Winds generally light with this system,
though some local gusts around 20 kt will be possible this morning
over the southern and inner coastal zones in closest proximity to
the low.  Otherwise, seas remain dominated by relatively short-
period components but remain short of both overall heights and
steepness to preclude the need for any small craft advisories at
this time.

Looking ahead, high pressure will likely rebuild over the waters
around Tuesday and hold through much of the week ahead. This will
maintain relatively uneventful weather conditions over the waters.
Expect seas to again build late in the week as the high pressure
breaks down. 12<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The Skokomish River has fallen below flood stage
this morning and the river stage will continue to fall through this
week. With no hydrologically significant QPF, the river should
remain below flood stage through the week. No river flooding is
expected on any other area rivers. 62<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
