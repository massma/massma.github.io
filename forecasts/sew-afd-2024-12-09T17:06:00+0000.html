Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
906 AM PST Mon Dec 9 2024

.SYNOPSIS...High pressure will build back into the region for the
first couple days of the workweek, with plentiful sunshine for
Monday afternoon after some morning stratus and patchy fog. Cloud
build back in for Tuesday however as the pattern returns to
unsettled Wednesday with multiple disturbances passing through to
the weekend

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A few areas of low clouds and patchy fog this morning
will give way to more sunbreaks this afternoon. Partly to mostly
clear skies tonight and cooler temperatures will result in more
widespread fog tonight into Tuesday morning with areas of dense
fog and visibilities below 1/4 mile. Will be taking a closer look
at that potential this afternoon.

In the longer term, attention will turn to the potential for a
stronger weather system Saturday into next week resulting in the
potential for strong gusty winds as well as coastal flooding.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Western Washington
currently sits in between a trough to the east (that produced the
weather this past weekend), and a ridge up the Pacific Coast to
Alaska. Above the region is the polar jet bringing in drier and
cooler air into the region from the north. Surface high pressure
sits underneath this ridge. This will weaken the gradients to
where there will be some areas of low stratus and fog this morning
until the sun is able to burn it off later in the day. The fog is
expected to be hit-or-miss and not widespread.

Monday will likely be the sunniest day of the week once the skies
clear out late this morning into the afternoon. Winds will be very
light under the high pressure and most of the cloud cover will
burn off (may linger longer in the South Interior. Temperatures
will peak in the mid 40s today, with lows around 30. High clouds
will build back in Monday night/Tuesday as the ridge begins to
move inland ahead of a trough. Tuesday is expected to remain
relatively dry, but a surface trough underneath the high pressure
to the south may be enough to produce a couple of light showers in
parts of the region (pop chances were too low to include in this
morning`s forecast update).

The real change back to unsettled weather will occur on Wednesday.
A weakening shortwave trough will approach the region with
increasing chances of precipitation later in the day across the
entire west part of the state. This trough (from Wednesday into
Thursday) is not expected to be an all day washout, as
precipitation amounts are expected to be very light (with several
hundredths for most areas and a few tenths in the Olympics/Pacific
Coast). Temperatures will warm up a few degrees (but still stay in
the 40s for highs and upper 30s for lows).

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...The previously mentioned
trough Wednesday will move through on Thursday with a weak surface
system. The amounts of QPF again appear pretty light through the
end of the day. The snow levels will be 3,500 feet in the
Cascades (4,500 feet for the Olympics), and this will also keep
snow accumulations light as well.

Ensembles/deterministic models show a more organized low moving
into the region from Friday into the weekend. It is too early to
tell how much precipitation could come frontal systems moving
through with this low feature, but agreement is pretty good that
we will see something move up our way towards the end of the week.
Please stay tuned for more details in future forecasts.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge remains over the area with the
ridge axis offshore giving the area north northwesterly flow aloft.
Surface high pressure will remain in place through at least Tuesday.
Light surface gradients combined with plenty of low level moisture
will create IFR or LIFR conditions especially Tuesday morning.

A mixed bag of conditions continues this morning ranging from LIFR
to VFR ceilings. LIFR/IFR ceilings are expected to dissipate by 20z.
Mostly clear skies this evening and continued light surface flow
will lead to widespread LIFR by early Tuesday A.M. with visibilities
below a mile and ceilings 200 feet or less. Conditions are expected
to improve to VFR early Tuesday afternoon.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings continue into midday. Slow improvement in the
afternoon with VFR ceilings by 00z. LIFR ceilings and visibilities
developing around 08z continuing into Tuesday morning. Light and
variable wind becoming light north northeasterly this afternoon
through Tuesday morning. Felton/27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...Surface high pressure over the waters through
Tuesday will weaken Wednesday. A front will reach the area late
Wednesday into Thursday. High pressure will briefly rebuild
Friday. Small craft advisory winds possible over the coastal
waters with the front.

Seas in the 10 to 12 foot range continuing this morning before
subsiding below 10 feet this afternoon. Seas building to 10 to 12
feet again behind front Thursday night. Felton

&&

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Conditions will dry out throughout the first half of
this week under high pressure. A weak system is on track to bring a
quick shot of precipitation on Thursday and Friday, with rainfall
amounts of an inch or less. A stronger storm system will set up
along the coast over the weekend with potential to bring in more
significant precipitation. While area rivers will rise with this
weekend system, the Skokomish River is currently the only river
forecast to enter Action Stage, potentially nearing minor flood
thresholds. However, liquid amounts remain uncertain and conditions
will continue to be monitored.
