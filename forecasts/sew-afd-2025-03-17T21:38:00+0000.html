Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A trough will bring showers to the region tonight with
a convergence zone over King and snohomish counties. Upper level
ridging building briefly on Tuesday will give way to a break in
the wet weather. A series of systems will move over the region
later in the week through the weekend for rounds of lowland rain,
mountain snow, and breezy winds at times.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cool upper level trough
will track through western WA tonight with showers and mountain
snow. Heavier snow amounts will be focused over Snohomish and King
counties where a Puget Sound Convergence Zone will set up.
Stevens and/or Snoqualmie Passes may see 2-5" depending on the
convergence zone. The air mass is slightly unstable with a chance
of thunderstorms too (interior and Cascades). Expect chilly
overnight temps with lows dropping into the lower 30s, with
freezing temps around the south sound.

A ridge moves inland on Tuesday for a mainly dry day. There still
is some lingering moisture but overall precipitation amounts look
light (if any). Afternoon highs are around 50 degrees for most
sites.

The ridge shifts farther inland on Wednesday, while a trough digs
offshore. The trough will push eastward Wednesday night with
showers increasing across the area. Snow levels will remain low,
around 2500`, and the mountains will see a few more inches of
accumulating snow. In addition, gusty S/SE winds are expected
along the coast and north interior with gusts to 45 MPH possible.

More wet and windy weather is headed our way Thursday/Thursday
night. Main impacts will again be possible heavy mountain snow and
gusty S winds at the coast and north interior. 33

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Western WA remains under
strong, moist, SW flow on Friday with addition rounds of lowland
rain and mountain snow. Snow levels remain low enough for possible
accumulating snow at all Cascade passes.

The flow remains nearly zonal moving into the weekend, with precip
rates increasing on Sunday due to a warm front (especially over
the coast and mountains). Snow levels will be rising to over 6000`
by Sunday night, leading to mostly rain in the mountains. The warm
front slowly lifts north into B.C. as we move into Monday. The
main focus is on the river levels for any potential flooding,
which so far is limited only to the Skokomish River in Mason
County. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft will become more northwest flow
Tuesday morning as weak ridging builds offshore. VFR cigs this
afternoon with continued showers across Western Washington. A
convergence zone will continue to develop across King, Snohomish,
and Kitsap Counties into this evening, resulting in brief vsby
reduction and lowering cigs towards MVFR. Otherwise, cigs will lower
again Tuesday morning into MVFR for most areas or low-end VFR. There
may be localized areas of IFR, as well as patchy fog develop, mainly
near KOLM with any clearing. Cigs will improve to VFR cigs Tuesday
afternoon. W/SW winds through this evening, with N/NE winds north of
the convergence zone in central Puget Sound. Winds will become
lighter tonight.

KSEA...Primarily VFR cigs into tonight. A convergence zone near SEA
will bring lowering cigs near MVFR between 23z to 03z with showers
in central Puget Sound. Cigs will improve to SCT/BKN after 06z for a
period, before lowering again towards MVFR Tuesday morning. There is
a 30 to 35% chance of MVFR cigs Tuesday morning. SW winds are
expected to transition N/NW around 23z due to convergence zone
activity. N/NW winds may be breezy at the onset, with gusts of 15 to
20 kts possible. Winds will then transition more S/SE between 03-05z
before remaining light south tonight. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow continues through tonight before a brief
surface ridge builds on Tuesday. Small Craft Advisory westerly winds
are expected at times through this evening for the central and
eastern portions of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Another frontal
system will approach Western Washington on Wednesday for increasing
S/SE winds. A Gale Watch has been issued for the Coastal Waters
Wednesday into Wednesday night due to the increasing winds. There is
also a slight chance of storm force wind gusts for the outer Coastal
Waters Wednesday afternoon, but at this time confidence remains low.
Additional headlines are likely for portions of the interior waters
as well, especially for eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca, Admiralty
Inlet, and northern inland waters.

Winds will briefly ease early Thursday before increasing Thursday
night into Friday as another front moves across the area for
additional headlines. Winds will remain elevated at times over the
weekend with continued unsettled weather.

Seas of 7 to 9 feet will continue through Tuesday night. Seas will
build Wednesday into Thursday to 13 to 18 feet with the next weather
system. Seas will remain elevated, mainly above 10 feet, going into
next weekend. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Heavy precipitation and higher snow levels will lead
to rising rivers moving into late this weekend and early next
week. So far only the Skokomish River in Mason County is rising
above flood stage.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
