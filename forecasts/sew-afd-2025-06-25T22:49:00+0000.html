Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low clouds and occasional light showers will
continue to spread across western Washington through Friday.
Shower chances will peak Thursday into Thursday night. Warming
and dry conditions are expected this weekend through Monday.
Temperatures will reach the upper 70s and 80s by Monday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak waves embedded
in shallow troughing will move across the region through Friday.
This will keep western Washington largely cool and cloudy with
occasional rain chances (peaking Thursday/Thursday evening).
Temperatures will top out in the 60s to around 70 degrees each
day. Rainfall totals will likely be highly variable due to the
showery nature but anywhere from a trace to 0.20" is possible in
most areas. Precipitation chances will wind down across the
region by Friday night.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...The pattern shifts to
an amplifying ridge this weekend allowing for temperatures to
warm and dry conditions to prevail. Currently the warmest day of
the period will likely be Monday when temperatures reach back
into the upper 70s and 80s across the region. HeatRisk values
will generally be in the Minor (yellow) category over the
weekend with a few favored areas (Seattle, south sound, and
Cascade valleys) reaching the Moderate (orange) category Monday.

Forecast confidence falls off rapidly after Monday next week.
There are two primary drivers of the uncertainty - the evolution
of a weak upper level low located somewhere near California and
the breakdown of the ridge over the western US. The evolution of
these features next week is all over the map in the ensemble
guidance. The result in a 10th-90th percentile spread of 15-20+
degrees by late next week. The general consensus is that Monday
and Tuesday will be warm days, but how much cooling takes place
by mid to late week is highly uncertain. Similarly, while there
is good agreement that the week will start off dry, confidence
is low in if and when precipitation will return mid to late next
week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Ceilings have improved for the majority of the terminals
this afternoon into VFR, with the exception of KHQM and KCLM. Both
these terminals will remain MVFR for the rest of today. Another
weak system is expected to impact the terminals Thursday morning.
Consequently, cloud cover will increase again overnight, bringing
widespread lower ceilings between 6z-10z. MVFR ceilings are
expected at the terminals, with IFR ceilings possible at the coast
and Kitsap Peninsula (30-40% chance). Rain is expected to impact
the coastal terminals around 16z-19z and reach inland terminals
around 20-22z. Some model guidance does hint at some potential to
improve to VFR near the end of the TAF package for some interior
terminals; however, at this time confidence is low as it looks
like improvement will be brief and MVFR ceilings will quickly
establish again shortly after this TAF package.

Generally southwesterly surface winds (except KPAE that is
northwesterly), becoming more southerly overnight. A weak push of
westerlies expected along the Strait of Juan de Fuca this
afternoon/evening.

KSEA...VFR conditions are expected to prevail this afternoon into
tonight. Ceilings will lower early Thursday morning between 8z-10z
into MVFR. At this time guidance is suggesting that ceilings will
not lower into IFR, as probabilities are 5% or less. Rain is
expected to reach the terminal around 19z-21z. Guidance hints at
potentially seeing some improvement into low-end VFR beginning
around 21z-0z. However confidence is low at this time, as other
guidance hints at ceilings quickly returning to MVFR after 3z.
Southwesterly flow will become more southerly overnight.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak front will move over the waters late today
into Thursday. Westerly pushes through the Strait of Juan de Fuca
are favored each evening. Today`s push is expected to remain below
Small Craft Advisory criteria. Wind gusts may approach or exceed 21
kt at times, but with probabilities of exceeding 21 kt in the 30-45%
range, decided to hold off on issuance. At this time there is not
strong signal that the westerly pushes across the Strait will meet
Small Craft Advisory criteria this week and into early next week.
High pressure will rebuild over the waters Friday and persist into
the weekend, establishing northwest flow over the coastal waters.
High pressure will begin to weaken early next week.

Seas will generally be around 3-4 ft throughout the week and will
increase slightly during the weekend to 4-6 ft, persisting into
early next week.
