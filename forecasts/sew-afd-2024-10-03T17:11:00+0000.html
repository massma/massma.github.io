.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Forecast remains on track
this morning with no updates required. Previous discussion
follows.

Upper level ridge over the area this morning shifting east this
afternoon. Patchy fog will dissipate by mid morning. Sunny
conditions will warm temperatures into the 60s this afternoon.
Could see a couple low 70s in the Cascade foothills.

Transition time tonight with the upper level ridge well to the
east and the next front approaching the area. Rain out ahead of
the front beginning along the north coast late tonight with a
chance of rain from about a Bellingham to Shelton line westward by
12z Friday. Increasing clouds in the early morning hours will
keep lows in the 40s.

Front moving through Western Washington Friday. Frontal passage
along the coast late morning, Puget Sound area early to mid
afternoon. Front reaching the Cascades late afternoon. Unlike most
of the recent fronts this one will stay together as it moves
through the area. Hurricane force winds on the summit of Mount
Rainier ( forecast 80 mph ). Decent rainfall amounts along the
coast with up to an inch possible. In general a quarter to a half
inch of rain for the interior. Surface gradients turning onshore
quickly post frontal with a convergence zone developing over
Snohomish county mid to late afternoon. Models have a small CAPE
bullseye there of about 300 J/KG. Will add a chance of
thunderstorms to Snohomish county extending east into the Central
Cascades late afternoon. Highs will be lucky to get out of the
50s.

Not a very big pool of cold air behind the front Friday night
with an upper level ridge building by early Saturday morning.
Post frontal shower activity outside of the convergence zone
decreasing Friday night. Convergence showers or thunderstorms
could last into the early morning hours Saturday. Lows in the 40s.

Post frontal onshore flow Saturday morning producing stratus over
the area. Subsidence with the upper level ridge building will
dissipate the marine layer by Saturday afternoon leaving sunny
skies. Highs in the lower to mid 60s.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Extended models continuing
to show good consistency in the 00z run. Upper level ridge over
the area Sunday. Ridge shifting east Monday but Western Washington
still on the backside of the ridge. Weak front stalling northwest
of the area close enough for a chance of rain from about Hoquiam
to Bellingham. Huge upper level trough starts moving out of the
Gulf of Alaska Tuesday. This will kick what is left of the front
through Western Washington. Upper level trofiness Wednesday will
keep a chance of showers in the forecast. Highs a little above
normal Sunday and Monday, mid 60s to lower 70s, cooling into the
lower to mid 60s Tuesday and near 60 Wednesday. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft becoming southwesterly as a ridge
exists to the east and a trough approaches western Washington on
Friday. Low stratus has mostly lifted across the area, leaving
mostly clear skies with high clouds over the area. VFR conditions
will continue through the TAF period. Clouds will increase across
the area late tonight as the front approaches the area by tomorrow
morning. MVFR conditions may develop along the coast by tomorrow
morning, but will likely not develop through the interior until
Friday afternoon.

Winds N/NE up to 10-12 kt today, decreasing to mostly light and
variable tonight.

KSEA...VFR conditions through the TAF period. Increasing mid
to high level clouds tonight. Winds N to NE 8 to 12 kt.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Winds currently northeast over the coastal waters. Light
offshore flow will continue today, with slight enhancement in the
flow through the Strait of Juan de Fuca and to the southwest of
Grays Harbor. Winds will ease tonight before turning southerly
tomorrow as a frontal system moves through the area Friday. A Small
Craft Advisory remains in effect for the coastal waters on Thursday,
primarily for seas but gusty winds may reach 20-25 kt at times. A
Gale Watch remains in effect for the Central and Eastern Strait of
Juan de Fuca as the westerly push behind the front may allow for
gusty winds to reach near 35 kt.

Seas this morning remain 9 to 12 ft this morning but should subside
throughout the day today. Waves will rise up to 10 to 12 ft tomorrow
in accordance with the frontal passage. By Saturday, seas will drop
back down to 4 to 6 feet before building back to 6 to 8 feet next
week.
