Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
850 PM PST Thu Dec 19 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A series of weak fronts will bring several rounds of
light precipitation through the rest of the week, paired with
breezy winds and warmer temperatures. A more active pattern will
develop this weekend and into next week, with an increased risk of
impactful weather during the holiday.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Front from this afternoon
responsible for rain finds itself pretty much right on the
Cascade crest or a little east of there this evening and continues
to move eastward. For W WA, this means some lingering low to mid
level clouds as well as maybe a shower or two...but overall,
activity is trending downward. Speaking of low clouds, will need to
be mindful of the potential for fog development through the night
and into Friday morning...and starting to see some visibility
impairment from obs in the more fog-prone areas of the CWA.

Otherwise, W WA is in for a quiet night as a shortwave ridge will
keep conditions dry at least into mid-morning Friday, with the next
front expected to reach the coast by late morning and locations east
of the Sound in the afternoon. That said, no changes needed to
inherited forecast. Additional forecast details follow.

From Previous Discussion...We`re in an active weather pattern with 6
frontal systems moving inland over the next 7 days. However, there
are no strong signals for hazardous weather impacting western WA
through the weekend. We may see occasional gusty east winds in the
passes and Cascade gaps but high wind is not expected. Lowland
temperatures will remain above freezing with lows in the 40s. Highs
will be in the 50s each day. May see some light snow in the Cascades
on Sunday with a few inches possible. 33

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...From Previous
Discussion...Storm after storm continues to track through western WA
moving through next week - keeping the pattern active. E/SE winds
will be gusty at times along the coast although the probability of
high wind (gusts over 50 mph) remains low. Lowland temps remain
above freezing throughout. The air mass does get cooler by Christmas
Day with snow levels lowering down to around 3,000 ft. We may see
travel impacts with snow in the Cascade passes, with mountain snow
lingering into Thursday. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft tonight becoming southwesterly
Friday morning as upper level trough digs south offshore and warm
front moves by to the west of the area. Offshore flow continuing
in the lower levels.

Mostly VFR ceilings Central Puget Sound. MVFR ceilings over the
Northwest and Southwest Interior with IFR along the coast and
locally over the Kitsap peninsula. Little change in the ceilings
overnight into Friday morning. Increasing low level offshore flow
as warm front moves by to the west midday Friday improving
ceilings with mostly VFR ceilings by 20z. Ceilings lowering back
down to MVFR west of Puget Sound late Friday afternoon.

KSEA...VFR ceilings through Friday. Southeast wind 4 to 8 knots

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Gale Warning is still in effect for the outer coastal
waters while a Small Craft Advisory is in effect for the inner
coastal waters. Small craft southerlies will also pick up this
evening in the East Entrance of the Strait of Juan De Fuca,
Admiralty Inlet, and the Northern Interior Waters.

Another frontal system is looking to track Friday into Saturday
with gales over the coastal waters once again. Additional systems
through the weekend and into the first half of next week will
continue to bring gusty winds and elevated seas.

Combined seas this afternoon 9 to 12 feet. Seas will then build
upwards to 15 to 20 feet Sunday into Monday as another system
keeps seas elevated.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Rivers will continue to recede tonight, with the
Skokomish River remaining the only river in flood stage. The
Chehalis River at Porter will crest below flood stage tonight and
start to recede.

Additional incoming precipitation later this week looks to remain
light with only minor rises on area rivers expected. The Skokomish
River will continue to recede, but remain in the vicinity of flood
stage the next few days. The threat of river flooding across western
Washington will increase again mid to late next week, with ensembles
showing the potential for significant precipitation to return. While
discrepancies remain, this may cause an increasing chance of river
flooding and landslide concerns that may impact holiday travel.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
