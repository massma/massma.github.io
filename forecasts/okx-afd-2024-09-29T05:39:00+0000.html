Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
139 AM EDT Sun Sep 29 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
A stationary front remains south of the area through Sunday
night as high pressure noses in from the northeast. The high
remains Monday and Tuesday as low pressure tracks east through
the Mid Atlantic Monday and moves offshore Monday night into
Tuesday. A cold front then passes through Wednesday afternoon
into night, followed by high pressure through Saturday.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TODAY/...
Adjusted forecast to have categorical POPs for the rest of
tonight for either drizzle or light rain. Rain amounts of just
a few hundredths of an inch or less expected. Otherwise,
remaining cloudy with easterly winds which will keep
temperatures from falling too much. Increased mins slightly,
mainly in the lower 60s.

High pressure remains across the northeast and nosing into the
region through Sunday. Meanwhile, a stationary front remains
south of the region, near the Delmarva region, with a weak
frontal wave along the coast.

Upper riding does build into the northeast Sunday, as the
surface high noses a little farther to the south. Light rain
remains possible across the southwestern sections, and have
maintained chances probabilities into Sunday morning, then went
dry across the forecast area, although some global guidance does
hint at some light rain Sunday afternoon. The HRRR also
indicates some redevelopment of rain across coastal sections
during the day Sunday.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH 6 PM MONDAY/...
With the high remaining across the northeast and into the
forecast area, keeping the region mainly dry until later Monday
as the surface high is expected to begin to weaken and the
frontal wave along the mid Atlantic coast begins to track into
the western Atlantic. There is some uncertainty with the
strength of the high and timing of its weakening Monday.

&&

.LONG TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...
Low pressure emerges off the Mid-Atlantic coast and slowly
passes to our south offshore Monday night through Tuesday night.
Still some differences among the global models regarding the
northern periphery of rainfall from this system with the GFS
being the northern outlier. Will remain close to NBM PoPs and
maintain a slight chance to a chance of rain through the period.
Any rain amounts should be light.

For Wednesday, weak high pressure remains over the forecast
area in the wake of the offshore low drifting farther east. A
cold front approaches during the day and passes through most
likely during the afternoon to evening hours. Moisture will be
limited by the time this occurs, so it likely remains dry. High
pressure builds in behind the front and remains in control
through Saturday with a continuation of dry weather. High
temperatures through the long term forecast shouldn`t stray too
far from seasonable, which is generally 70-75.

&&

.AVIATION /06Z SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A stationary front remains south of the region through Sunday
night.

Mainly IFR ceilings into Sunday morning with intermittent
drizzle or light rain. Likely some fluctuation between MVFR and
IFR. Visibilities with the light rain and some patchy fog will
vary mainly between MVFR and VFR.

Rain chances gradually decrease through the day, but spotty
light rain into the afternoon cannot be ruled out. Expecting
ceilings to lift from IFR to MVFR during this time. Improvement
to VFR possible by early evening, becoming likely into Sunday
night.

Winds will be from the east near 10 kt through the TAF period.
Some 15-20 kt gusts will be possible along the coast in the
afternoon, but likely more occasional.

     NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Amendments likely overnight and on Sunday with changing flight
categories.

Occasional gusts to near 20 kt possible Sunday afternoon.

Timing of improvement to VFR may be off by a couple of hours.

OUTLOOK FOR 06Z MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...

Sunday Night: Improving to VFR.

Monday: Mainly VFR. Chance of rain late Monday into Monday night
with MVFR.

Tuesday: MVFR/IFR with a chance of rain. ENE wind gusts 15-20 kt,
diminishing at night.

Wednesday: Mainly VFR. Slight chance of rain.

Thursday: VFR.

.MARINE...
A strong pressure gradient remains over the western ocean
waters, west of Moriches Inlet, with strong and gusty easterly
winds continuing into Sunday morning. With the winds slower to
diminish, have extended the SCA for these waters until 800 PM
EDT Sunday. For the ocean waters east of Moriches Inlet, the
timing of seas falling below 5 feet still looks OK, and the
advisory ends there at 200 PM EDT Sunday. Once ocean small craft
conditions end winds and seas are expected to remain below
advisory criteria through Monday.

Conditions across the non-ocean zones are expected to remain
below advisory criteria through the rest of the forecast period.
As for the ocean waters, both winds and seas reach advisory
thresholds Monday night with an easterly flow. This remains the
case through Tuesday night, but SCA conds will continue through
Wednesday night due to seas remaining elevated with a lingering
ESE swell.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
There are no hydrologic concerns through next week.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
A high risk of rip current development continues through Sunday
with long period southeast swells.
