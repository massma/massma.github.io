Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
933 AM PDT Wed Sep 11 2024

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showers are continuing this morning across the region,
primarily over the Cascades and along the coast. There is still a
surface trough behind the occluded front off the coast this
morning that will move in this afternoon. High resolution guidance
shows a cluster of moderate showers forming over the Olympics,
tracking southward towards Olympia this afternoon. Cool air aloft
may be enough to trigger an isolated thunderstorm or two, but will
remain weak.

.SYNOPSIS...The first in a series of low pressure systems has
arrived, setting up a more autumnal pattern. Rain continues to
move onshore this morning and will last through much of the day.
Cooler temperatures and cloudy conditions will last throughout the
forecast period with occasional showers. A stronger front may move
through on Monday or Tuesday.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Moderate showers are moving
onshore early this morning and will continue to do so throughout
much of the day today. There have been some cloud flashes and
isolated lightning just to the south of our CWA along the coast,
and an embedded thunderstorm cannot be ruled out namely in areas
south of Puget Sound and along the coast. Any thunderstorms that
happen to develop are expected to be pulsey and short lived.
Lightning and gusty winds would be the main associated hazards. That
said, the probabilities are still low. Rainfall amounts through
Thursday morning have gone up slightly, with up to an inch of
precipitation likely in the southern Cascades and a quarter to
half inch throughout much of Puget Sound. Widespread 60 degree
temperatures are expected today, and with the continuation of a
cooler and showery pattern, temperatures like this are expected to
continue through the weekend. Given the nature of the front and
the cooler airmass impacting the area, this front is going to
provide snow to the upper elevations of Mount Rainier, but snow
levels are still going to be higher than locations like Sunrise
and Paradise.

A decrease in shower coverage is likely on Thursday as shortwave
ridging moves in. Temperatures will be only slightly warmer and a
bit closer to 70 degrees, with a similar expectation for Friday.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Ensembles and long range
height anomalies show persistent troughing over the Pacific
Northwest through the middle of next week. A few showers are
likely over the weekend, but won`t be very widespread and perhaps
more confined to the higher elevations. Extending out into the
beginning of next week, there appears to be a more robust frontal
system poised to move in late Monday or Tuesday, dropping in from
the Gulf of Alaska. Timing of its arrival will vary as more
details become clear in subsequent forecast packages.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>South to southwest flow aloft this morning will
transition to northerly by late this afternoon as an upper trough
axis shifts onshore then east of the Cascades by this evening. A
range of conditions out there this morning with scattered shower
activity. Terminals may briefly go IFR should any heavier shower
activity pass overhead. Shower coverage will diminish by late this
afternoon with ceilings lifting to low end VFR for most areas. Light
surface flow and remnant low level moisture favors the redevelopment
of low MVFR or IFR ceilings in stratus tonight into Thursday
morning.

KSEA...A mix of VFR and MVFR ceilings in scattered showers is
expected today. Ceilings should lift to primarily low end VFR
between 22Z to 04Z before sinking back to low MVFR or IFR in stratus
before daybreak on Thursday. Light S/SW surface winds will gradually
veer to light northwesterly by late afternoon before backing to
light southerly again tonight. 27/14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak surface trough over the coastal waters will
gradually fill as it shifts onshore this afternoon. Broad surface
ridging centered well offshore then rebuilds through Thursday.
Another weak trough is expected to slide southward from the British
Columbia coast later Friday into Saturday, but remains unlikely to
generate any impacts at this time.

Seas are currently between 3-5 ft over the coastal waters, but will
build towards 5-7 ft tonight. Seas will then gradually subside
towards 3-5 ft again heading into the weekend. 27/14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak low pressure system will spread additional
showers across much of the region this afternoon. Some modest
instability and cooler air aloft will bring the potential (15-20%)
of an isolated thunderstorm, with the highest chances across the
southern half of the area through the evening. Expect any
thunderstorms that develop to be short-lived and of the pulse
variety, putting out only a strike or two before falling apart.
Additionally, additional rainfall with these storms (60%+ chance of
wetting rain in these areas) and abundant antecedent rainfall should
preclude significantly elevated fire weather concern.  Otherwise,
fire weather concerns remain minimal with near to below normal
temperatures and additional round of rainfall through the week
ahead.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
