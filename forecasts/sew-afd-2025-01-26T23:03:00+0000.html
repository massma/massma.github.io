Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
303 PM PST Sun Jan 26 2025

.SYNOPSIS...An upper level ridge centered offshore will gradually
build into the region through the early portion of the week. This
will lead to dry conditions and chilly overnight temperatures.
The ridge will weaken by midweek and a series of systems will
bring a return of lowland rain and mountain snow Friday into the
weekend, with a threat of lowland snow late in the weekend.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure at the
surface and aloft continues to provide dry, cool conditions across
the area with light low level offshore flow. Little change in the
overall pattern is expected heading into Monday with more chilly
nights ahead and sunny, cool days. Surface gradients will be
lighter and this will contribute to a little more patchy freezing
fog/low clouds across the Southwest Interior and Puget Sound the
next couple mornings. The upper ridge begins to weaken and get
suppressed southward Tuesday into Wednesday as a system rides
over the top of it into north/central British Columbia. This will
begin the process of opening the door to a series of systems
reaching Western Washington at the end of the week.


.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Unsurprisingly, the models
are pushing back the arrival of the first front a smidge. Current
model timing generally agrees with bringing rain to the coast
late Thursday night and spreading precip across the interior
Friday morning. The front looks to stall a bit offshore before
getting shoved inland Friday night with rain and a solid shot of
mountain snow. Beyond this, the models crucially began to diverge
with respect to the depth and track of the trailing upper trough.

As discussed yesterday, this continues to have significant
implications in terms of both precip type and amounts moving into
the Saturday night and Sunday period. Taking a closer look at
both ensemble meteograms and NBM output, snow probabilities are
beginning to rise sharply by Sunday. The NBM now shows a 50-60%
probability of a fraction of an inch of snow by Sunday afternoon
over the entirety of lowland Western Washington. Those
probabilities fall to 25-35% for an inch. But given these numbers
7 days out, it`s becoming quite apparent that we`ll need to be
watching this evolving scenario closely in the days ahead. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure over the offshore waters and
over Eastern Washington with a weak surface trough along the coast
through Tuesday. Both areas of high pressure will weaken Wednesday
and Wednesday night. Next front moving through the waters Thursday
night and Friday morning. Possible small craft advisory winds with
the front over the coastal waters. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
