Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
923 AM PST Thu Jan 9 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Drier conditions will return today as high pressure
builds inland. The next round of lowland rain and mountain snow
will arrive on Friday as a trough moves through the Pacific
Northwest, with showers lingering through the weekend under moist
northwest flow. Drier conditions are forecast to return by early
next week as high pressure rebuilds.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Pockets of low clouds and
fog this morning, otherwise dry with high pressure overhead. A
mix of clouds and sun this afternoon with highs in the 40s to
lower 50s. 33

Previous discussion...Satellite imagery early this morning shows
widespread low stratus across much of western Washington, with
surface observations showing areas of patchy fog along the eastern
Puget Sound lowlands northward through Bellingham. Radar imagery
shows echoes moving inland along the periphery of the offshore
ridge, which will bring little more than a brief drizzle to the
region early this morning as high pressure builds inland.
Conditions are on track to improve throughout the morning, giving
way to another mostly sunny afternoon across western Washington.
Highs today will stay on the mild side, reaching the upper 40s to
low 50s across the lowlands, with slightly warmer temperatures
along the coast and through the Cascade foothills.

The next frontal system will sweep across the Pacific Northwest
on Friday, bringing in lowland rain and mountain snow alongside
breezy westerly winds. Snow levels will fall to 3000-4000 ft by
Friday afternoon, resulting in a few inches of snow accumulation
through Snoqualmie and Stevens Passes. Forecast confidence is also
increasing over the potential for the development of Puget Sound
Convergence Zone showers over the central Cascades late Friday
which may locally enhance snowfall amounts into early Saturday
morning.

Models remain in good agreement over drying at lower elevations
on Saturday, with lingering snow showers over the Cascades under
moist northwest flow aloft. Snow levels will dip to roughly 2000
ft, though any additional snow accumulation amounts on Saturday
will be light. The rest of the region will see cloudy skies with
some afternoon sun breaks and highs in the mid to upper 40s.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Forecast models have come
into better agreement over a shortwave rippling southward across
the region on Sunday, maintaining light showers over higher
terrain. A high pressure ridge is then favored to build over the
western US to start next week, which will allow for drier and
warmer conditions to return. Weak forcing and residual moisture
will likely allow for rounds of low stratus and patchy fog around
the Puget Sound lowlands each morning with mostly sunny skies
returning each afternoon. Ensembles are now keeping conditions dry
through Wednesday night, with the next chance of precipitation
entering the region towards the end of next week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest flow aloft continues today as an upper ridge
axis just offshore shifts over the area. This will then back to west
to southwesterly tonight, increasing in speed as an upper trough and
associated frontal system approach the area. Continued widespread
IFR/LIFR ceilings in stratus across the interior lowlands will
gradually lift and scatter in the 18Z-20Z time frame. Latest obs
from around the area seem to support this trend, but will need to
monitor. High and mid level moisture will lower and thicken tonight
ahead of the approaching front. MVFR ceilings in rain will develop
along the coast late tonight with said conditions spreading into the
interior around daybreak on Friday.

KSEA...IFR to LIFR ceilings in stratus will persist through much of
the morning before lifting and scattering 18Z-20Z. VFR with high
clouds expected this afternoon and evening. Ceilings will lower back
to MVFR by 15Z Friday as rain spreads into the area. Surface winds
northerly 5 to 7 knots through the morning, backing to E/SE by early
evening. 27/18<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface ridging centered east of the Cascades will weaken
today and a frontal system will approach the waters tonight. A warm
front will brush the coastal waters this evening and the trailing
cold front will sweep onshore Friday morning. Broad surface ridging
will rebuild offshore in its wake for increasing onshore flow Friday
afternoon into Friday night. The ridge will expand into area waters
over the weekend for a relatively quiet period into early next week.
It will then shift into the interior by the middle of next week for
a period of offshore flow. Coastal seas will climb back into double
digits with the front tonight and Friday. Seas will then straddle
the 10 foot threshold over the weekend before subsiding early in the
coming week. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
