Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
307 PM PST Mon Nov 18 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Troughing will maintain rain and mountain snow showers across
western Washington that will diminish tonight. The next system will
rapidly develop on Tuesday, spreading strong winds inland Tuesday
afternoon into Wednesday morning alongside lowland rain and mountain
snow. An active pattern is favored to continue through the rest of
the week with low pressure offshore.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level troughing
will continue over western Washington, allowing for continued shower
activity through Tuesday morning. Snow levels will generally stay
between 1000-2000 feet with light rain amounts over the lowlands and
lessening snow totals over the mountains. Cloudy skies will give way
to some sun breaks this afternoon, with highs in the mid to upper
40s today for the lowlands. Some clearing of cloud cover over the
mountains overnight may also allow for some locations in the
southwest interior to dip near freezing overnight, with some rain
snow mix shower activity in the early morning hours over some of the
higher hills.

An anomalously strong surface low will continue to intensify
offshore on Tuesday, bringing significant weather to western
Washington. The following impacts are listed below:

* STRONG WINDS: Intense pressure gradients will cause strong east
  winds to develop Tuesday afternoon through Wednesday morning.
  Areas along the Pacific Coast and along the Cascade Foothills will
  see gusts up to 65 mph. Areas elsewhere will see gusts up to 50
  mph. Most area waters are favored to see Storm Force winds. The
  strongest winds will occur Tuesday evening into the early morning
  hours Wednesday. Significant impacts may occur at lower-than-usual
  wind speeds due to the atypical easterly wind direction.

* BLIZZARD CONDITIONS: Strong winds in combination with moderate
  mountain snow will impact travel through the Cascade Passes, where
  gusty winds will likely cause periods of whiteout conditions. The
  strongest impacts will occur Tuesday evening through early
  Wednesday morning when east winds will be strongest.

Precipitation accompanied by strong winds will spread across western
Washington by Tuesday evening as a front lifts across the area. Snow
levels will rise to 2500-3500 feet into early Wednesday, and
easterly gap winds will allow snow levels through the Cascade Passes
to be slightly higher. Despite higher snow amounts on the eastern
slopes of the Cascades, a Blizzard Warning has been issued for
strong winds contributing to periods of whiteout conditions through
the Passes. Snow amounts will reach 4 to 12 inches above 2500 feet
through Wednesday morning, with locally higher amounts over the
highest peaks.

The upper level low will weaken and retrograde on Wednesday, sliding
another front across the area. This will cause conditions to
destabilize and change stratiform precipitation over to showers,
which are on track to continue throughout the day Wednesday. Snow
amounts will lighten over the mountains, and precipitation will
continue across the lowlands that will measure up to half an inch of
rainfall through Wednesday. Rainfall amounts will be higher over the
Olympic Peninsula, where rain totals along the coast will reach 1 to
2 inches.

A longwave upper low will remain off the coast on Thursday,
spreading another impulse northward across the region that will
maintain widespread shower activity. Snow levels will rise above
3000-4000 feet with an additional few inches of snow accumulation
across the mountains. Rainfall amounts will be lighter across the
lowlands.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Model solutions start to
split heading into the weekend, though ensemble consensus maintains
unsettled conditions across the region through Monday.
Troughing offshore is favored to shift inland towards the end of the
weekend, but the exact timing and placement of any fronts is
uncertain at this time. Ensembles favor light snow accumulations
across most of the Cascade Passes each day through the weekend and
into early next week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Zonal flow aloft as broad troughing briefly moves
through the region, with a weak shortwave ridge building through
western Washington this afternoon. Cigs are mixed between MVFR and
VFR this afternoon, but the trend is generally for MVFR cigs to last
overnight and into tomorrow morning. Surface winds will be out of
the south to southwest at 5 to 8 kt. The bigger forecast challenge
will come tomorrow afternoon as a strong area of low pressure off
shore nears the coast and generates strong easterly wind across the
majority of western Washington. North to south oriented runways may
face challenges with crosswinds Tuesday night into early Wednesday
morning.

Additionally, there is a possibility for a subtle ridgetop inversion
in the Cascades, which could generate some mountain wave activity
that impacts terminals in Puget Sound. Confidence on this scenario
is low (less than 20 percent), but it is something to be aware of.
The winds will begin subsiding by 12Z on Wednesday. Though the main
headlines of this storm will be wind, there will also be some rain
with it and the combination could lead to varying levels of
visibility and ceilings.

KSEA...MVFR at the terminal this afternoon, with these conditions
likely to persist through the overnight hours. Wind speeds have
been from the south to southwest at 10 kt, with the occasional
gust to 15 kt. Expect some showers to linger in the vicinity after
06Z, but there could be a period of VFR cigs tomorrow morning.
Winds will begin to veer easterly after 18Z tomorrow as the next
storm system impacts the area. Easterly wind speeds of 20 to 25 kt
with gusts over 35 kt are likely through early Wednesday morning.
As mentioned above, the possibility for mountain wave activity
impacting Puget Sound terminals exists, but confidence is low.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong and expansive area of low pressure, around 960
mb, will impact the area and its waters beginning tomorrow afternoon
and last into Wednesday morning. Here are the key points for the
marine forecast:

* Seas: Seas will remain elevated now until Tuesday afternoon, with
  Small Craft Advisories for such conditions changing over to Storm
  Warnings to reflect the onset of the strong easterly winds. Seas
  over the outer coastal waters may reach heights of 25 to 30 feet,
  with 12 to 18 ft seas closer to the Washington coastline. The
  Storm Warning also extends to the Strait of Juan de Fuca where the
  winds could generate seas of 8 to 11 feet.

* Wind: The onset of the strongest winds over the waters will begin
  late Tuesday morning, and intensify through the afternoon and
  evening. Winds associated with the storm warning call for gusts of
  65 kt with sustained speeds of 40 to 45 kt. Similar speeds are
  forecast for the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The Northern Inland
  waters have Gale Warnings posted and Puget Sound will face an
  upper end Small Craft Advisory. The easterly direction of the wind
  limits the amount of alignment needed throughout Puget Sound to
  cause further impacts.

* Grays Harbor Bar: Rough bar conditions will linger throughout the
  duration of this storm, but with an extra consideration on the
  unusual east wind. Combined with the ebbs and heightened seas on
  the immediate coast, conditions are likely to remain hazardous
  across the bar.

In the wake of this system, seas will be slow to calm, but 10 ft
seas or less will finally be achieved on Thursday.

.HYDROLOGY...Precipitation over the Olympics Tuesday night into
Wednesday could push the already running high Skokomish above flood
stage Wednesday. Snow levels down to around 2000 ft during the
heaviest precipitation could limit the runoff and any flooding
chance. The flood watch for Mason county will continue. Rises also
forecast for the remainder of the rivers this week but the
combination of relatively low snow levels and the lack of heavy
mountain precipitation will keep rivers in their banks.
