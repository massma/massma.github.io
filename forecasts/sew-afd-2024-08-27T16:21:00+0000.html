Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
921 AM PDT Tue Aug 27 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A trough moving over the PNW will maintain showers
and below-normal temperatures for the area on Tuesday. High
pressure will build Wednesday onward, allowing conditions to dry
out and warm up into the weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No significant changes
made to the forecast this evening. The previous discussion can be
found below along with updates to the aviation and marine
sections:

An upper-trough is present across the PNW along with its
associated cold front. This front, stretching from British
Columbia into western Washington and back out in the Pacific is
lifting moisture as widespread clouds and rain is evident given
latest satellite/radar analysis. Guidance has rainfall continuing
but will become less widespread as the morning progress. Showers
and a PSCZ will linger in the wake of the aforementioned frontal
boundary.

As alluded to, a convergence zone will persist into the
day over King County before 925-850mb winds shift more
northwesterly and steer it towards Pierce County by the afternoon.
The heaviest precipitation is slated to fall over the Cascades
and higher elevations given orographic lift. Showers are in the
forecast elsewhere but again, mostly over topographic barriers.
Along with showers, isolated thunderstorms are possible as the NBM
hints at a slight chance (15%) for the northern interior. With
meager SBCAPE (250 j/kg) and mid-level lapse rates becoming
conditionally unstable we`ll reflect the threat in this morning`s
forecast package. High temperatures will range throughout the 60s
across the CWA. Conditions are to dry out tonight as higher
heights build into the region with upper-level ridging looming
offshore. Overnight lows are to bottom out between the mid 40s to
lower 50s. Mostly clear skies, residual surface moisture, and
efficient cooling will reintroduce patchy fog across the area as
well by early Wednesday morning.

Large scale subsidence will ensue as upper-ridging gets
comfortable throughout the remainder of the short term. Here we`ll
see temperatures bounce back into the 70s on Wednesday and 80s on
Thursday. Abundant sunshine and the return of warm conditions
will feel much more like summer here in late August. Overnight
lows will again be in the 40s and 50s.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Guidance is in agreement in
regards to upper-level ridging and above normal temperatures
in the long term. A weak trough is slated to slide northward into
the region towards the beginning of next week. Uncertainty
remains over the intensity and exact placement of this low
pressure system. Upper and mid level moisture will likely increase
as a result towards the end of the weekend, which may lower
temperatures and allow for isolated shower and thunder activity to
form over higher terrain, but as of now confidence is low.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow continues across the region this morning
with an upper trough moving east into Western Washington. Expect
northwest flow aloft by the afternoon with onshore low-level winds
bringing gusty winds through the day. Lingering lower clouds will
gradually lift and scatter this morning for most, though a Puget
Sound Convergence Zone will maintain some showers and locally lower
ceilings across portions of the area through around midday. Some low
clouds likely return tonight near the coast and portions of the
interior, especially in the more favored locations.

KSEA...VFR conditions and generally southeast surface winds this
morning with a weak PSCZ located north of the terminal. Expect this
to begin to fade out and shift south by early afternoon, with
perhaps a shower and brief lowering of ceilings as it slides
through. Otherwise, a switch to breezy north surface winds around 7-
8 kt this afternoon through the evening. Light southeast winds
return by 12z tonight with some scattered low clouds but likely VFR
conditions remaining.     Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Post-frontal onshore flow will continue to generate small
craft advisory winds and choppy seas over the coastal waters and
across portions of the Strait of Juan de Fuca today. Onshore flow
will begin to relax tonight into Wednesday as broad surface ridging
rebuilds over the offshore and coastal waters. Thermally induced
low pressure expanding northward along the Oregon and
Washington coast Thursday through Saturday will turn the flow more
northerly. Winds are expected to remain generally under advisory
levels across area waters with the exception of perhaps the southern
outer coastal waters.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
