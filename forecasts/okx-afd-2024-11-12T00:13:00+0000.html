Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
713 PM EST Mon Nov 11 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A secondary cold front moves through the region tonight. Strong
high pressure from the Great Lakes builds in Tuesday through
Wednesday before departing away from the region Wednesday night
into Thursday. A weakening frontal system will approach from the
west on Thursday while an ocean storm passes well to the east
and moves into the Canadian Maritimes. This storm will then
remain over the Canadian Maritimes into Monday as another high
builds into the region Sunday and Monday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM TUESDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No significant changes, updating for current conditions.

Shortwave trough digs south as it swings east tonight, sending
a secondary cold front through the region.

The fropa should come through mostly dry, with perhaps an
isolated shower possible across the far interior. Winds increase
overnight once again as the front clears and high pressure
begins to return from the west. CAA in the flow will begin to
filter in a cooler regime for the next several days.

Temperatures overnight fall back into the 40s for most of the
region, or around 50 in NYC.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...
Upper trough axis over the region shifts offshore on Tuesday as
a strengthening 1032 mb surface high builds east into the Great
Lakes. The tightened pressure gradient between it and the departing
frontal system will allow for a blustery day.

Much drier air advects into the region with the resultant NW flow.
Skies largely clear, and abundant sunshine prevails. Given expected
afternoon RH values near 30%, along with frequent gusts 30 to 35
mph, conditions appear favorable for rapid fire spread once again.
See Fire Weather section further down for additional detail.

With the CAA, 850 mb temperatures fall to near 0C, and will lead to
a chillier day than recent for the Tri State, with highs into the
low to mid 50s. Subsidence inversion expected to set up Tuesday
night and winds decouple, especially inland. The clear sky and
lightening winds should help temperatures tumble to some of the
coldest values so far this season, particularly around NYC.
Overnight lows are progged in the 20s and 30s, with most outside
the urban metro falling below freezing.

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
Dry weather continues through much of the extended period with only
slight chances of precipitation across portions of the region
Thursday night through Friday night.

Temperatures below normal Wednesday and Thursday, near normal Friday
and Saturday, and 5 or more degrees above normal Sunday and Monday.

With the NBM handling the weather rather well, with little deviation
from the deterministic, and with most parameters similar to the
previous forecast, have mainly followed the NBM. Only deviation was
for winds and gusts during the northwest and north flow regimes
Saturday and Monday as high pressure builds into the region. There
is a chance that low temperatures Wednesday night will be lower than
forecast, especially across the interior, as winds become light to
near calm, and with good radiational cooling under mostly clear skies.
Continue to mention frost for Wednesday night with these conditions.

Precipitation across western portions of the region Thursday night
into Friday will be associated with a weakening frontal system, and
little to no precipitation may fall, as forcing is weak, and weakens
as the system passes to the southwest. And to the east,
precipitation will be associated with an offshore low that
retrogrades into the Canadian Maritime under a weakening Omega
block.

.AVIATION /00Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A secondary cold front will move across the terminals tonight
followed by strong high pressure building in from the Great Lakes
region on Tuesday.

VFR through the TAF period.

Winds will average around 10 kt at NYC terminals and around 7-8 kt
elsewhere for the first half of tonight. The passage of the
secondary cold front (06z-08z) will increase winds and shift them to
the NW. Sustained speeds of 15-20 kt with gusts 25-30 kt are then
expected on Tuesday morning and afternoon. Some peak gusts around 35
kt are possible.

     NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB)TAF Uncertainty...

Start time of gusts late tonight/early Tuesday morning may be off by
1-2 hours.

Peak gusts around 35 kt possible Tuesday.

OUTLOOK FOR 0Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

Tuesday night: VFR. NW winds become more N at night with gusts
weakening to closer to 25 kt in the evening, then diminishing
further overnight.

Wednesday-Thursday: VFR. Slight chance of a shower Thursday Night
near the coast.

Friday-Saturday: VFR. NW wind gusts 15-20 kt possible Friday and NW
wind gusts 20-25 kt possible Saturday.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Winds and gusts this evening have been running below previous
forecast values as the gradient remains weak across the waters.
Winds pick up once again later tonight into Tuesday with the
passage of a secondary cold front. NW flow with gusts 25 to 30
kt on all waters tonight thru at least Tuesday evening.

Small Craft Advisory in place for all local waters, with the
ocean already in effect, and non ocean waters beginning at 6Z
tonight. Possible gales on the ocean into Tuesday night but
confidence in frequent 35 kt gusts remains a bit too low to
warrant a Watch with this update. Maintained a mention of this
possibility in the HWO. Seas up to 6 ft on the ocean as well
through this period.

There is the potential that wind gusts will be at SCA levels on
the eastern Long Island Sound and eastern Long Island bays,
along with SCA gusts and seas on the ocean waters east of Fire
Island Inlet Wednesday morning as high pressure builds in the
from the west. With the high building over the waters during
Wednesday conditions are expected to fall below advisory levels
Wednesday afternoon. This will be dependent on how quickly the
high builds over the forecast waters, and SCA conditions may
linger on the far eastern ocean waters into Wednesday night.

Otherwise, winds and seas will be below advisory levels on the
waters into late Friday. Late Friday into early Saturday there is
the potential for marginal SCA conditions on the eastern ocean
waters as northwest winds and gusts increase as offshore low
pressure passes to the east.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.FIRE WEATHER...
Gusty NW winds on Tuesday up to 35 mph in the afternoon will couple
with lowering RH values near 30% and drying fuels to once again
increase the risk of rapid fire spread should ignition occur.

After collaboration from our neighboring offices and state partners,
hoisted a Red Flag Warning for all of southern CT and NY zones thru
6 pm Tuesday. A Special Weather Statement was utilized for northeast
NJ zones where RH values may be slightly higher.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
Moderate drought conditions have developed per US Drought
Monitor. Stream flows are generally below the 25th percentile of
normal for this time of year. There are no hydrologic concerns
through early next week.
