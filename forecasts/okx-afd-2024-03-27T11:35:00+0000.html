Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
735 AM EDT Wed Mar 27 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
A frontal system approaches today and passes offshore early
Thursday. Low pressure develops along the front and tracks east
of the area Friday. A clipper type system passes to the south
and east late Saturday through early Sunday. Another low moves
through the Great Lakes region Monday and Tuesday as a warm
front approaches.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
The fcst is on track. Stratus has overspread the area with the
entire cwa ovc this mrng. Lowest lvls are not saturated so not
much fog. A few pockets of lift came thru and produced -ra and
dz overnight. With cigs lowering thru the mrng hours and signs
of more pockets of omega in IR, will continue with chances for
lgt rain and dz thru 15Z.

An increase in mid lvl moisture, as well as lift around 7-12k
ft, could help to produce more pockets of rain this aftn. Time
heights suggest high based pcpn with evap cooling indicated by
llvl subsidence. As a result, only went with light rain chances
and kept out the dz. Did have to go abv NBM pops in this
scenario.

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT/...
A 150+ kt h2 jet provides upr divergence tngt. The response
should be moisture convergence and lift across the cwa based on
the position of the jet. As a result, the fcst is for periods
of rain and dz across the entire cwa and went well abv the NBM
pops for many areas.

Much of the same for the first part of Thu, then the nature of
the sys transitions as low pres begins to deepen over the Atlc.
Uncertainty with the modeling. The 00Z ECMWF is well E of the
benchmark with the low. The NAM, GEM, and GFS are left of the
track but still E of the benchmark. This favors ern areas for
getting into the rain shield on the wrn side of the low Thu aftn
and eve, and less rain elsewhere. Any further ewd trend could
relegate most of the pcpn to the ocean. NW winds lock in by
aftn, then gradually increase Thu ngt as they respond to the
falling pres. The low doesn`t really get going until Fri aftn
based on the progs, and by that time, it is expected to be 200
to 300 miles E of Montauk and pulling away. Stuck with drying
NBM pops from W to E Fri, with brisk winds Fri into Fri ngt.

NBM temps with local adjustments were used.

&&

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
No significant changes in the long term period and stuck fairly
close to previous forecast/NBM.

Dry weather is expected Saturday. A clipper type system is expected
to pass south and east of the region Saturday night into early
Sunday. With slightly above normal temperatures Saturday into Sunday
much of the area will have rain showers, with maybe a rain/snow mix
across the northern tier Saturday night.

Weak high pressure briefly builds into the area Sunday and
quickly weakens Sunday night. A near zonal flow will bring an
amplifying trough into the central US and Great Lake region
Monday into Tuesday as a warm front with the low slowly approaches
from the south. The NBM continues to show some likely probabilities
with the system for next week, but will continue to keep POPS capped
at chance with some uncertainties in the guidance with the timing of
the warm front, which may well be delayed with the low remaining
across the Great Lakes region.

NBM temperatures looked reasonable through the extended and
were used. Temperatures will mainly be near normal levels except
slightly above for Saturday and Sunday.

.AVIATION /12Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front slowly approaches today and tonight.

MVFR/IFR conditions expected this morning. A light onshore
flow, will result in the possibility of mist, fog, and drizzle,
through the morning push. Can not rule out some localized sub
IFR possible right around daybreak, however confidence is low on
exactly where that occurs. Gradual return to MVFR is expected
mid to late morning, with ceilings remaining near or under 3 kft
into the afternoon. There is a chance we see a period today of
VFR conditions, however confidence remains low on timing and
duration. Conditions fall back to MVFR/IFR tonight, with areas
possibly falling below IFR after 06z.

Rain is expected to develop become more steady across KSWF
around 18z, eventually moving into all the terminals around or
after 00Z Thursday.

Light winds tonight generally under 5 kt may be a bit variable
in direction, but with an easterly component. Southerly flow
becomes more established this afternoon, though speeds remain
light. The light and variable winds will continue into tonight.


     NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Timing of category changes may be off by several hours. A period
of VFR conditions will be possible this afternoon.

OUTLOOK FOR 12Z THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...

Thursday: IFR with rain, eventually tapering off late at night
except at KGON. Improvement to MVFR at night. NW wind gusts
Thursday night to near 20 kt.

Friday: MVFR early, becoming VFR in the afternoon. Slight chance
of rain early for KISP and KGON. NW wind gusts 20-25 kt.

Saturday: Mainly VFR during the day. Chance of showers and MVFR
at night, possibly mixed with snow for KSWF. W-NW wind gusts
20-25 kt day. Gusts diminish at night.

Sunday: Mainly VFR. NW wind gusts 15-20 kt afternoon into evening.

.MARINE...
A sca remains in effect on the ocean thru tngt, then seas around
4 ft on Thu. Winds increase Fri with a sca or mrgnl gale
possible Fri and Fri ngt. Conditions slowly improve across the
western waters during Saturday, and then the eastern waters
Saturday evening, as the low tracks through the Canadian
Maritimes, and high pressure builds to the west.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
No hydrologic impacts are anticipated into early next week,
unless an unexpected shift occurs with the storm sys on Thu.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
The overnight guidance generally keeps all areas blw minor
flood thresholds today and tngt. The extreme high end of the
ensemble spread suggests a low prob to hit minor during the eve
high tide cycle for the usual spots on the South Shore. Due to
the low prob of occurrence and limited impacts if it does, an
advy/statement has not been issued attm.

&&

.OKX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CT...None.
NY...None.
NJ...None.
MARINE...Small Craft Advisory until 8 AM EDT Thursday for ANZ350-353-
     355.
