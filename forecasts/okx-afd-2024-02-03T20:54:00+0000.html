Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
354 PM EST Sat Feb 3 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure builds in from southeastern Canada through the
weekend and remains in control through midweek. This high
pressure area eventually shifts southeast of the region and
offshore Thursday into Friday. By late week, a frontal system
approaches from the west, with an associated cold front
approaching Friday night and moving across on Saturday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SUNDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Dry weather continues tonight as high pressure builds across the
region. Northerly breeze is expected to diminish by this evening as
the low level flow weakens. Clear skies and light winds will result
in a good radiational cooling night with temperatures dropping into
the 20s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Quiet weather continues through Monday as the region will remain
under a weak high pressure.

Sunday and Monday will both feature mainly sunny skies with highs
mostly in the low to mid 40s. Overnight lows Sunday night should be
mostly in the low to mid 20s except across the NYC Metro Area where
temperatures are forecast to be in the upper 20s to low 30s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Dry conditions continue through much of the week. Temperatures
exhibit an overall warming trend. No significant low pressure area
look to impact the region during the long term.

Synoptic pattern shows local region on the western side of a mid
level trough Monday night through Wednesday. The pattern then shifts
to mid level ridging Wednesday night through Thursday night. The
area will be on the Backside of the mid level ridge Friday into
Friday night with a trough moving in from the west, which appears to
flatten going into next weekend.

At the surface, high pressure from SE Canada will build along the
Northeastern Seaboard Monday night through Wednesday night. The
center of this high pressure area traverses the local area Thursday
and then shifts southeast of the region out in the Atlantic
thereafter through Friday. An area of low pressure approaches the
region from the Great Lakes Friday into Saturday. The low goes into
SE Canada next weekend.

The associated cold front approaches Friday night and moves across
Saturday. For Friday night into next weekend, there is forecast
possible precipitation. Multiple shortwaves are moving across during
this timeframe but the larger scale trough pattern flattens out
during this time period. Surface temperatures and low levels are
forecast to stay above freezing for this time period, keeping
precipitation as rain. POPs are less than 30 percent as the frontal
system will have limited moisture.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
