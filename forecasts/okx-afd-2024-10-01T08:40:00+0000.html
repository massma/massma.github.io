Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
440 AM EDT Tue Oct 1 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure remains in place over the Northeast today as an area
of low pressure passes off the Mid Atlantic coast. A weak cold front
from the west on Wednesday, before high pressure reestablishes over
the region on Thursday and remains in control through Friday. A
weak cold front will pass through the area sometime on Saturday
followed by high pressure to end the weekend. A stronger cold
front looks to move through early next week.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
Can`t rule out a bit of radiative fog and mist in some locales
early this morning with a bit of clearing, but so far appears
limited in coverage.

October opens on a relatively quiet note, offering dry conditions
and temperatures near normal for early autumn. The upper low that
has been drifting east over the Mid Atlantic opens into a trough as
it slides offshore today. Meanwhile, strong ridging and surface high
pressure remain over the Northeast, with the local region in between
these features.

Surface low pressure is able to develop off the Carolina coast
into this evening, though placement looks too far south for any
local impacts, with the exception of continued cloud cover.
Temperatures near 70 this afternoon fall back into the 50s
tonight.

&&

.SHORT TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/...
Shortwave and weakening cold front approach on Wednesday, with
high pressure remaining in place ahead of this. The shortwave
lifts north into Wednesday night as the front washes out to the
west. With limited forcing, not anticipating any impacts other
than an increase in low level cloud cover Wednesday evening.
Perhaps a rogue shower can survive into the far interior of the
LoHud Valley, but even this look isolated at best.

Otherwise, look for mostly cloudy to overcast skies Wednesday,
beginning to clear out Thursday with high pressure building over the
region. Ridging builds over the Eastern US ahead of a broad
trough off to the north and west. With deep S/SW flow, will
start to see a warming trend into late week. Highs in the upper
60s on Wednesday bump into the low to mid 70s for most by
Thursday.

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
High pressure centered offshore will remain in control through
Friday. Aloft, heights start to fall late in the day as a shortwave
trough approaches. The warming trend will continue with a S/SW flow
through the column. Blended in some of the NBM 90th percentile with
the NBM deterministic for highs Friday. This gives widespread mid to
upper 70s for most, low 70s across eastern LI.

A cold front associated with the aforementioned shortwave trough
will move through sometime early on Saturday. This feature has
trended weaker from 24 hours ago and there is better overall
agreement across the global models. This solutions will lead to some
light rain showers if anything on Saturday. Capped at slight chance
PoPs.

High pressure will build in again to end the weekend. A stronger
upper level trough and cold front look to move through sometime
early next week. Although still far out for specifics, this has
potential to result in gusty winds and moderate to locally heavy
rain. No hydrologic impacts are expected at this time.

.AVIATION /09Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure remains northeast of the region through the TAF
period.

Visibilities remain VFR during the TAF period. VFR ceilings
initially will transition to MVFR ceilings early this morning with
development of low stratus. Also have KGON in TEMPO for IFR for a
few hours. The MVFR stratus could last into the late
morning/early afternoon before scattering out. Have taken MVFR
cigs out of the prevailing group at the NYC terminals and
placed in a TEMPO as confidence in MVFR has decreased. Cigs
then lower to MVFR again tonight.

Winds remain generally easterly through much of the TAF period near
5-10 kts. A few gusts of 15-20 kt are possible this afternoon,
mainly along the coast.


 NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Have taken MVFR cigs out of the prevailing group at the NYC
terminals and placed in a TEMPO as confidence in MVFR has
decreased.

Start and end time of MVFR cigs may be off an hour or two from
the TEMPO group.

OUTLOOK FOR 06Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

Tonight: Cigs lowering to MVFR with development of stratus.

Wednesday through Friday: Mainly VFR.

Saturday: Mainly VFR. A slight chance of showers with MVFR possible.

.MARINE...
Ocean seas build to around 5 ft today, and linger into at least
the first half of Wednesday. Small Craft Advisory remains in
effect on the ocean zones through 10Z Wed, but an extension
further into the day is possible.

Thereafter, sub SCA conditions are likely on all waters through
the weekend. There is potential for 25+ knot gusts and 5+ ft
seas with a cold frontal passage early next week.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
There are no hydrologic concerns through early next week.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
Astronomical tides will be increasing with the approach of a new
moon Wednesday afternoon. This combined with a persistent easterly
wind may push levels right up to minor flooding benchmarks for the
Wednesday morning high tide cycle. A statement may eventually be
needed to address this for the south shore back bays of Nassau and
Queens.

&&

.OKX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CT...None.
NY...None.
NJ...None.
MARINE...Small Craft Advisory from noon today to 6 AM EDT Wednesday for
     ANZ350.
     Small Craft Advisory until 6 AM EDT Wednesday for ANZ353-355.
