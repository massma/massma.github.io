.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Isolated light showers will continue across Western
Washington this afternoon and taper off tonight. Dry conditions
return on Sunday as high pressure settles over the region.
Conditions expected to remain mostly dry into late next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Radar imagery shows light
showers moving southeast across Western Washington this afternoon.
Outside of showers, locations have seen mostly clear to partly
cloudy skies. Shower activity is expected to last into tonight
as an upper level trough pushes eastward across the region. The
upper level trough will exit the region late tonight and
conditions will dry out on early Sunday morning as an upper level
ridge begins to move onshore. Sunday overnight temperatures will
decrease into low-to-mid 30s across most of Western Washington,
with the coldest temperatures in the southern interior. The
combination of clear skies, light winds, sufficient moisture, and
temperatures near freezing will promote patchy frost development
overnight. As a result, a Frost Advisory has been issued for the
southern/southwest interior, Cascade foothills, West Whatcom
County, and Lake Crescent Area. High temperatures on Sunday will
be the upper 50s to low 60s.

Monday will remain dry as the ridge axis pushes east across Western
Washington. Daytime temperatures will be on the warmer side on
Monday; high temperatures will be in the mid-to-upper 60s, and a few
locations may even reach 70 degrees. The ridge will push east into
the Rockies late Monday night and a shortwave trough will follow
right behind it. Guidance has been consistent in little to no
precipitation on Tuesday. The bulk of the precipitation will stay
to the north of Washington in British Columbia. If any
precipitation does make it into our area, it will likely stay
limited to the Northern Cascades. Temperatures will be slightly
colder on Tuesday; high temperatures will be in the upper 50s to
low 60s, and low temperatures will be in the upper 30s to low 40s.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Models begin to disagree
slightly on Wednesday. While both the deterministic EURO and GFS
show a low swinging down from British Columbia, the EURO model keeps
Western Washington mostly dry (low pressure center is further east
into Idaho), while the GFS has a wetter solution (low pressure
center over Washington). Looking deeper into probabilities with the
latest NBM run, it does not give a strong signal for precipitation
at this time (20% or less, with highest PoPs in the Northern
Cascades). Depending on the track that low pressure takes, it will
determine how much precipitation Western Washington will get.

WPC ensemble clusters are in good agreement with a strong upper
level ridge building offshore on Wednesday and Thursday as it slowly
moves east towards Western Washington. On Friday, there are some
differences on the location of the ridge axis among ensemble
members. Half of the members have the ridge axis over Western
Washington, while the other half have it offshore. Depending on how
quick this ridge pushes eastward, it will determine the arrival of
precipitation into Western Washington. This uncertainty is also
reflected by the EURO and GFS. The EURO has the ridge pushing out
of the region much quicker than the GFS. Depending on what
scenario plays out, rain chances may return as early as Saturday.

Temperatures will gradually warm up Wednesday into Friday. By
Friday, a few locations may even see high temperatures in the low
70s. Daytime temperatures will cool slightly on Saturday. Low
temperatures will generally be in the upper 30s to low 40s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow will ease this afternoon and evening
with showers in the interior and Cascades dissipating. Light winds
and clearing overnight may allow shallow fog development,
primarily around the south sound. Otherwise, high pressure and
northerly flow will bring dry and VFR conditions on Sunday. 33

KSEA...Showers with a convergence zone in the vicinity this
afternoon, with winds switching to N 5-10 kt. Will see patchy low
clouds near the sound early Sunday morning. Otherwise, dry with
VFR conditions Sunday afternoon and evening. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>.Will continue to see Small Craft Advisory winds through
the Strait of Juan de Fuca this evening, with onshore flow easing
after 06z. A thermal trough will form along the coast on Sunday
for offshore flow. A weak front will reach the waters on Monday
with increasing N/NW winds over the Coastal Waters. Onshore flow
will prevail by midweek with high pressure centered off the coast.
