Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
902 AM PDT Thu Oct 17 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Shower activity will taper off throughout the morning
today, providing some relief to wet conditions before an
atmospheric river brings moderate to heavy rainfall to western
Washington over the weekend. Split flow will develop by early next
week, allowing conditions to dry out for a few days.

&&

.SHORT TERM...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The current forecast remains on track. No updates
are needed at this time.

Previous Discussion...An upper level trough axis
will continue to swing across western Washington this morning,
pushing shower activity southeastward and filtering cooler air
inland. Snow levels will continue to lower throughout the morning,
dropping as low as 3500 ft. With low temperatures hovering near
freezing at some of the higher Cascade mountain passes, some
passes including Stevens and Rainy Pass may see an inch or two of
snow accumulation on the roads through the morning. Precipitation
will taper off across the lowlands by noon, and higher terrain
showers will linger into the afternoon with several inches of snow
accumulation over the higher peaks of the Cascades and Olympics.
Drier air will surge inland with weak high pressure, allowing for
sun breaks this afternoon and mostly sunny skies along the coast.
Temperatures today will peak in the mid 50s across the lowlands.

Weak high pressure will continue to build inland overnight and
into Friday morning, providing brief relief from wet conditions
before an atmospheric river pattern develops over the region.

An atmospheric river will push into western Washington and
British Columbia mid-day Friday, bringing significant rainfall to
the region. While forecast models continue to highlight the bulk
of the moisture initially focused northward over British Columbia,
moderate to heavy rainfall is on track for the northern coast,
Olympics, and North Cascades on Friday. Rainfall over much of the
interior lowlands will be rain shadowed initially but will
continue to fill in across the region throughout the weekend as
the storm system slowly pivots to the south and exits the region
by late Sunday. Ensembles continue to show good agreement over
significant rainfall totals, with up to 3 to 6 inches currently
forecast over the Olympic Peninsula and North Cascades. The rest
of the Washington Cascades will likely see rainfall amounts up to
2 to 3 inches, with 1 to 2 inches across the lowlands. Higher
peaks of the Olympics and Cascades will also see a few additional
inches of snow accumulation over the weekend. Area rivers will
likely see sharp rises with this atmospheric river, though models
continue to keep river flows below action stage with limited
flooding impacts expected. Gusty winds will also accompany this
storm system, with gusts reaching 30 to 40 mph particularly along
the north coast and gusts of 20 to 30 mph elsewhere. Temperatures
will warm up several degrees as this system moves over the region,
peaking in the low 60s across the lowlands on Saturday and
Sunday.

.LONG TERM...A front will cross the region on Monday as a
positively tilted trough pushes the atmospheric river system
eastward, maintaining light remnant shower activity across western
Washington. At the same time, a cutoff low is forecast to develop
offshore near California, developing split flow aloft by Monday
afternoon. This will allow conditions to dry out early next week,
providing relief from the first atmospheric river event of the
season. High pressure is favored to develop aloft by mid- week,
maintaining dry conditions and mostly clear skies. Temperatures
through the first half of next week will peak below normal in the
low to mid 50s across the lowlands.

.HYDROLOGY...The first atmospheric river of the fall season is on
track to bring periods of moderate to heavy rainfall to western
Washington over the weekend, which will cause sharp rises to area
rivers. Forecast models continue to show potential for 3 to 6
inches of rainfall over the Olympic Peninsula and North Cascades,
with 1 to 2 inches across the lowlands. Despite the significant
incoming rainfall, area rivers are not expected to rise into
action stage or reach minor flood thresholds, though river
conditions will continue to be monitored closely.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northerly flow aloft this morning becoming northwesterly
as an upper level trough over the region continues to move to the east.
Low level onshore flow will become light tonight.

Radar still showing some showers moving across the region this
morning. Showers will gradually taper through the morning and
early afternoon hours. Ceilings primarily MVFR to VFR this
morning, though a few isolated spots of IFR do persist. Ceilings
expected to improve to VFR for all areas by this afternoon with
the VFR ceilings continuing into Friday morning. Surface winds
generally persisting at 4-8 kts from the south.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings this morning improving to VFR by late
morning/early afternoon. VFR ceilings continuing into Friday
morning. Southerly wind 4 to 8 knots becoming briefly
northwesterly 00z-05z. Felton/14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak system will dissipate over the waters this morning.
Winds gusting to 25-30 kt across the coastal waters will ease
through the morning, but seas will continue to hover between 8-11
feet. Thus, small craft advisories will remain in effect for the
coastal waters through this afternoon. High pressure will build
this afternoon and then weaken tonight. A warm front will move
into the northern portion of the area waters Friday stalling into
Saturday. The warm front will lift north Sunday as the trailing
cold front approaches the waters. The cold front will then move
through the area waters Sunday night. High pressure rebuilding
over the coastal waters Monday.

Gale force winds are expected with the warm front over the
coastal waters as well as the entrances to the Strait of Juan de
Fuca, Admiralty Inlet, and the Northern Inland waters Friday
afternoon into early Saturday morning.

Seas 10 or 11 feet today will subside to 6 to 8 feet tonight. Seas
will rise again over the weekend towards 10-13 ft before subsiding
back towards 6-8 ft early next week. Felton/14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
