Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
656 AM EDT Tue Sep 19 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure builds into the region and remains in place through
Friday. High pressure shifts to the northeast of the area late
Friday into Saturday. A low pressure system may then impact the
region Saturday into early next week.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
Forecast on track with just minor adjustments to reflect current
observations. Otherwise, low pressure continues to lift further
to the north as high pressure builds in from the west. Expect
dry and mostly clear conditions today. An increased pressure
gradient between the departing low and building high will result
in some breezy conditions, especially this morning. West-
northwest winds around 10 to 15 mph can be expected with gusts
into the upper teens. Some gusts into the lower 20s can not be
ruled out. Temperatures today will climb into the lower and
middle 70s.

Tonight, as the the high builds closer to the area, winds will
become light, and with mostly clear skies, expect good radiational
cooling conditions. Temperatures across much of the region will fall
into the 50s. The usual cooler spots well north and west of NYC and
the Long Island Pine Barrens can expect temperatures in the 40s.

&&

.SHORT TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/...
Surface high pressure will remain over the region through the short
term with mostly sunny skies both Wednesday and Thursday. A
Northwest flow on Wednesday and more of a northerly flow on Thursday
will keep conditions really pleasant with high temperatures in
the lower and middle 70s both days.

Wednesday and Thursday nights temperatures will once again fall into
the 50s with a few spots reaching the 40s.

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
Global models and their respective ensemble system have a general
agreement on the synoptic pattern into the weekend, though
differences do exist in the handling of a late week system with
southeast origins. The ridging in that was in place over the
northeast during the week begins to weaken and move offshore by
Friday. At the same time, a slow, nearly cutoff upper low
originating over the Carolinas pushes slowly north and is somewhat
impeded by the ridging in place over the northeast. This upper low
remains across the northeast for much of the period resulting in
unsettled weather from the weekend into early next week.

With respect to sensible weather, dry conditions are expected under
subsidence and retreating surface high pressure Friday into early
Saturday. Some late day clouds may begin to overspread the area
Friday afternoon in advance of surface low pressure well to the
south of the local area.

Thereafter, a surface low begins to take shape off the southeast
coast and heads northeast into the weekend. There are differences in
the strength, track, and timing of this feature in the guidance, with
some maintaining the ridge to the northeast effectively suppressing
the track of the low to the south of the area keeping it dry. Others
track the system over the area, or just to the east, bringing a
plume of high PWAT air with it, resulting in a long period of
precipitation Saturday through Sunday, along with gusty winds. In
addition, some guidance, particularly GEFS members, is indicating an
inverted trough associated with the main sfc low approaching as
early as Saturday morning with an additional slug of precipitation at
the onset. Global ensemble (GEFS, CMCE, ECE) means, and thus the NBM
all paint about 1-1.5" Saturday into early Monday for the area, but
the spread in individual ensemble members is quite large. NBM
probabilities of >1" in any 6 hour period through Sunday remain
quite low at this time, less than 10% continuing over the past few
cycles. WPC has introduced a marginal risk of excessive rainfall for
Saturday. Details should come into better view over the next few
days with additional guidance sources available for that time horizon.

Ridging then looks to try and nose down from New England by Monday
afternoon, potentially clearing and drying out the area. Seasonable
temperatures are forecast for the period, though clouds and rain
over the weekend may allow for slightly cooler conditions.

.AVIATION /12Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>VFR.

High pressure builds over the terminals for the TAF period.

WNW winds will increase to near 10-15 kt with occasional gusts
to 20kts this morning into the afternoon. More frequent gusts to
near 20-25 kt are expected after the morning push, generally in
the late morning and afternoon. Gusts will begin to diminish by
late Tuesday afternoon as the pressure gradient weakens.

     NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

No unscheduled amendments expected.


OUTLOOK FOR 12Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

Wednesday - Friday: VFR.

Saturday: MVFR possible with a chance of rain showers. E gusts near
15-20 kt.

.MARINE...
A tight pressure gradient between a departing low pressure and
high pressure building to the west will result in gusts on the
ocean waters to be near 25 kt at times today. In addition,
southeast swells will be increasing from distant Hurricane
Nigel, with ocean seas reaching SCA levels, thus a small craft
advisory remains in effect across the ocean waters. The seas
will remain elevated through this evening, before lowering
tonight. Swells could linger into Wednesday, and seas may be
near SCA levels east of Moriches Inlet.

Winds on the waters should remain below SCA levels Wednesday
through Thursday night. A steepening pressure gradient then
brings increasing winds and potential for SCA gusts, especially
on the ocean on Saturday into Sunday. Seas may also become
elevated above 5 ft on Saturday to the north of low pressure
near the southeast coast.

Storm Nigel.

.HYDROLOGY...
No hydrologic impacts are anticipated through Friday.

The potential exists for a widespread precipitation event this
upcoming weekend. WPC has placed most of the CWA in a marginal risk
of excessive rainfall on Saturday. However, there is uncertainty in
the timing and amount of potential rainfall with this system at this
time.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
There is a high rip current risk for all Atlantic-facing
beaches today due to 3 to 5 ft swells with 8 to 10 second periods.

This should begin to lower on Wednesday, with a moderate risk in
place for all beaches.

&&

.OKX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CT...None.
NY...High Risk for Rip Currents through this evening for NYZ075-080-081-
     178-179.
NJ...None.
MARINE...Small Craft Advisory until 11 PM EDT this evening for ANZ350.
     Small Craft Advisory until 6 PM EDT this evening for ANZ353-
     355.
