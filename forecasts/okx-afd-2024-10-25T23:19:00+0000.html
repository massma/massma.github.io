Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
719 PM EDT Fri Oct 25 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front will move across the region late tonight into early
Saturday morning. Another large area of high pressure building
in for the weekend. A back door cold front will move through
from the north late Sunday night into Monday morning, with high
pressure building in its wake out of eastern Canada Monday into
Tuesday. The front will lift back to the north as a warm front
Tuesday night as the high sets up off the Southeast coast. A
weakening cold front should pass through on Friday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SATURDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Forecast on track with only minor adjustments to trend from
current observations.

High pressure over the region weakens and drifts south and east
as a weak wave of low pressure and cold front moving through
the eastern Great Lakes approaches through tonight, moving
through the area late tonight into early Saturday morning. This
system is expect to move through dry as little moisture is
available, with weak forcing. The upper ridge axis has moved
offshore with a weak shortwave moving into and through the
region late tonight. After temperatures initially fall this
evening, temperatures will be slower to decline late this
evening into late tonight with weak warm advection and increased
cloud cover. Overnight lows will be just above normal. Cold
advection then sets up toward 12Z with the surface cold front
passage.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM SATURDAY MORNING THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Despite the cold front, temperatures will not be that much
cooler than Friday, with highs a few degrees above normal.
However, a gusty northwest flow develops early in the morning,
with gusts 25-30 mph. Low relative humidity and gusty winds
will also elevate the spread of wildfires. See Fire Weather
section below.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will build from the west on Sunday beneath weakly
cyclonic flow aloft courtesy of a broad upper trough and closed
low over ern Canada. A shortwave trough digging into the base of
the longer wave feature will push a back door cold front
through late Sunday night into Mon and maintain cool temps into
Mon night, with some frost inland each late night/early morning
til then as high pressure builds SE into the area. A return flow
on Tue as the high passes to the southeast should bring some
moderation in temps back to a few degrees above normal.

A significant warming trend expected for mid to late week as a
warm front passes to the north and a Bermuda high sets up off
the SE coast. High temps will be in the 70s from Wed through
Fri, and may approach 80 in spots in urban NE NJ and in some
interior valley spots.

Dry wx should continue through the period. An approaching front
may bring slight chance of a shower inland late Thu night.
Latest ECMWF looks a little more robust with fropa but its
rainfall amts are sill rather light, with less than 0.1 inch for
most of the area.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

through Sat night. SCA also issued for the non ocean waters, as
wind gusts reach SCA levels Sat morning, and continue into
early evening on New York Harbor, and into late night on the
remainder of the non ocean waters.
