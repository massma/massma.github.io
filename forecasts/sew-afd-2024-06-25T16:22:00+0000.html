Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
922 AM PDT Tue Jun 25 2024

.SYNOPSIS...High pressure aloft continues to build over the
region, maintaining warmer and dry conditions through Tuesday. The
next upper trough crosses the area Wednesday and Thursday bringing
a return of showers and cooler temperatures. Expect a similar
pattern late in the week with a brief warm up alternating with
weak passing disturbances.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mostly clear skies with
high pressure building over the Pacific Northwest today.
Temperature already off a mild start across the interior and
expect afternoon temperatures to reach the upper 70s to around 80
in the interior, while coastal temperatures largely remain in the
60s a sea breeze arrives to halt the warm up. Remainder of
previous short/long term sections remain unchanged and follow.

Wednesday will be cooler and cloudier as the ridge pushes east
and a trough moves in from the west. Temperatures on Wednesday
will be in the 60s to lower 70s - close to average. We`ll also see
showers with the trough and the coast may see 0.25" or so through
the day. Post- frontal onshore flow increases Wednesday night
with a convergence zone setting up over Snohomish and King
counties. There is also a slight chance of thunderstorms in the
North Cascades where instability is the greatest.

The trough moves east of the Cascades on Thursday but we`re still
under moderate onshore flow with more cool and wet weather
(especially in the interior and Cascades). Temperatures will dip
again with highs only in the 60s. 33

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...High pressure rebuilds over
the region Friday and Saturday for a return of dry and mild
weather (temps closer to average). West to SW flow returns
Saturday night and Sunday with another trough over the West.
There`s not as much moisture attached to this system (compared to
Wednesday-Thursday) but we should still see measurable rain
across most areas. Moving forward, we`re stuck in zonal, onshore
flow, into early next week. There`s a chance of showers along the
coast and in the mountains with near normal temperatures. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Flow aloft turning more south/southwesterly this
morning as weak upper ridging builds over W WA. Satellite showing
just a few mid to high level clouds streaming overhead along the
northern coast and areas north of KPAE. Conditions primarily VFR
across the area terminals this morning and expect these conditions
to dominate throughout the rest of the day as high pressure
builds over the region. N/NE surface winds generally around 5 to
10 knots, turning more northwesterly by this afternoon.

KSEA...VFR conditions will continue throughout the remainder of
the day. North winds 7 to 12 knots this morning will gradually
ease into the afternoon and turn northwesterly, around 4 to 8
knots. Winds will then become light overnight and transition back
to the S/SW between 12-14Z Tuesday.

.MARINE...High pressure situated offshore will help influence
lower pressure inland, with relative onshore flow throughout the
next several days. Diurnal pushes through the Strait of Juan De
Fuca are possible each of the days that could result in Small
Craft Advisories at times, with general benign conditions over
the coastal waters. A frontal system will push through the area
waters on Wednesday, with elevated southerly winds, but latest
guidance shows winds to be under any criteria thresholds for now.

Coastal seas this morning have been hovering around 4 to 6 feet
and generally will maintain this height through midweek and into
the weekend.
