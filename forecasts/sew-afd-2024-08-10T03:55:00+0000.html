Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
855 PM PDT Fri Aug 9 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>.Warmer conditions will linger into Saturday for the
interior with cooler conditions along the coast. Afternoon and
evening thunderstorms over the Cascades this evening and again
tomorrow. Areas of lofted smoke and haze will continue into
Saturday as well. Onshore flow will bring much cooler, and below
normal, conditions Sunday into next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>It`s been an active
evening with many thunderstorms developing near the Cascades,
producing abundant lightning and locally heavy rain. Around an
inch of rain, around with a burst of hail, fell near Stevens Pass
earlier this evening as one of these storms very slowly moved
eastward. These have generally moved east of the crest, but some
thunderstorms do remain in the North Cascades. Otherwise, will
expire the Heat Advisory as planned at 9 PM for much of the
interior. While warm temperatures will continue Saturday for many,
the trend will be for somewhat cooler conditions as onshore flow
begins to increase again. Otherwise, no significant updates this
evening and the previous short and long term sections follow.

Increasing low level onshore flow will bring initial cooling
especially for the coast Saturday. Temperatures over much of the
interior are expected to remain above normal, with another warm,
hazy day with highs reaching into the mid 80s. As westerly flow
becomes more established this will help push some of the elevated
smoke out of the area, but this make take a bit of time to have
much effect... more likely into Sunday. The Cascades are expected
to see another 15 to 20% chance of thunderstorms, mainly along the
crest Saturday afternoon into the evening. Onshore flow will
increase further into Sunday, more developed morning stratus and
with more widespread cooler conditions, resulting in near normal
temperatures in the mid 70s for the interior and 60s along the
coast.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...The large scale pattern
continues to trend towards troughing over the Pacific Northwest
early next week and typical low level onshore flow. Ensembles
support this trend - highlighting below normal temperatures
during this period and limited precipitation potential.
Widespread morning clouds are the safe bet with even the potential
for limited drizzle. Temperatures next week will range in the mid
60s along the coast to mid 70s for the interior area.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft early this evening will become more
north to northwesterly as upper level trough axis moves through W
WA. Surface winds have already started to turn south to
southwesterly, with remaining terminals following suit by late this
evening and becoming more solidly southwesterly by late Sunday
morning. Most terminals seeing wind speeds around 3 to 6 kts and
will remain that way for the overnight period before increasing to 5
to 10 kts by noon Sunday. HQM running a little faster with 5 to 10
kts expected throughout the TAF period.

VFR conditions remain in place for majority of area this evening
with IFR to LIFR conditions present along the coast due to marine
stratus. This stratus will work its way inland thanks to a strong
onshore push tonight. How far inland is the major forecast problem
as some model data suggesting that it may not make it any further
west than the western banks of the Sound. Current forecast actually
has it getting to the east side...impacting SEA and BFI. May pull
that back a bit in 06Z issuance...still allowing for the prospect
of lower cigs, but relegating them to a TEMPO group given current
models latest lack of confidence. Haze this evening should give way
as onshore flow becomes more prevalent and should not be an issue
for Sunday.

KSEA...VFR conditions through most of the TAF period. As mentioned
above, models backing away from MVFR/IFR conditions overnight, but
will leave the prospect for them as a TEMPO group. West to
northwesterly winds this evening before turning southwesterly early
Sunday morning. Speeds this evening and overnight ranging 3-6 kts
before picking up a little bit to 5-10 kts by noon Sunday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the East Pacific with lower pressure
over land will allow for northwesterly onshore flow to continue with
diurnally driven pushes of westerly winds down the Strait of Juan de
Fuca. High resolution guidance is indicating that the push this
afternoon should largely remain under Small Craft Advisory
threshold, through there exists a 30-40% chance for some occasional
SCA gusts this evening. Latest observations confirm this...but with
only gusts meeting SCA criteria, will hold off on any headlines at
this time...but will continue to monitor.

Seas currently 4 ft at 7 seconds before increasing Saturday evening
and into Sunday as winds increase over the coastal waters, reaching
6 to 8 ft. With the dominant period being around 8 seconds, seas
will be steep and look to approach steepness criteria for a SCA.
Seas will subside back to 3 to 5 ft on Monday and into next week.

.FIRE WEATHER...An upper level shortwave trough will brush
Washington to the north today and make its way eastward over the
weekend. Thunderstorms have started to develop along the Cascade
crest this afternoon and expect thunderstorm activity to continue
through this evening. While guidance continues to suggest a 10-20%
chance of thunderstorms across the Olympics today, highest
probabilities for thunderstorm development remain across the
North Cascades at this time. Main threats with any thunderstorms
are lightning and gusty and erratic winds. Lightning strikes will
have the potential to create new fire starts.

A Red Flag Warning remains in effect for the North Cascades zone
658 for thunderstorms and gusty outflow winds through this
evening. Isolated thunderstorms have also developed this
afternoon across zone 659 and may continue to develop,
particularly near Mount Rainier, however, thunderstorm coverage
continues to look more isolated for this area.

Threats for thunderstorms will continue across portions of the
Cascades through the weekend, however chances will gradually wane
as the shortwave moves off to the east. 14
