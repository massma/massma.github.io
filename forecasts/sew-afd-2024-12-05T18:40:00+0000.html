Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak front will bring a few isolated showers to the
Olympic Peninsula this morning. A stronger front is
expected to bring more widespread precipitation this weekend, in
the form of snow in the mountains, and rain at lower elevations.
Breezy south winds are expected with this front Saturday morning. A
brief period of dry conditions will follow Sunday night into
Monday before the active pattern continues by mid-week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Patchy fog has largely
lifted across western Washington, with the only location still
under fog remaining the Bellingham area. The Dense Fog Advisory
will be allowed to expire at 10AM this morning. A trough
and associated weak surface front is moving through the area this
morning, bringing a few showers to the Olympic Peninsula, which
will taper off later today. Elsewhere, expect dry conditions
today with increased cloud cover moving in ahead of the
trough/front. The temperatures will also increase beginning
Thursday night/Friday morning; lows will be about 5 degrees warmer
than Thursday morning, and highs will return into the low 50s
Friday.

A closed upper level low from Alaska will track towards the
region Friday into the weekend. The center of the low will likely
track through central British Columbia, with the polar jet being
pushed to the south. A stronger warm/cold front combo is expected
to bring more widespread precipitation into the region Friday
afternoon through the weekend. The initial warm front will produce
showers along the coast Friday morning. The wettest day appears
to be Saturday morning with the cold front moving through, with
decent QPF totals of around 2-3 inches in the Northern
Cascades/Olympics/Pacific Coast, and around half an inch to an
inch in lowland areas. The snow levels will increase to around
9,000 feet Friday into Saturday morning with the warm front, but
quickly fall back to 3,000 feet Saturday afternoon. The
deterministic snow amounts increased slightly for the passes
(around 6 inches at Snoqualmie and 9.5 inches at Stevens Pass),
but probabilistically the mean still supports below advisory
accumulations for the North Cascades. Definitely will be worth
checking conditions (if traveling through the North Cascades this
weekend).

Additionally, there will be a brief period of breezy south winds
late Saturday morning and afternoon with the cold frontal
passage of up to 30 mph (breeziest points will be on the Pacific
Coast, Northwest Interior, and the Cascade Foothills. Again, these
are expected to be below advisory thresholds at this time.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Expect the shower activity
from Saturday to continue into Sunday, beginning to taper by the
afternoon. The cool air aloft will help keep any precipitation
falling as snow in the Cascade Foothills and Olympics (above 3,000
feet). There may be enough cool air aloft to concern a slight
chance of thunder along the coast Sunday (but could definitely
change between now and Sunday). There will be a mix of clouds and
blue sky going into next week. Temperatures will cool slightly,
with highs in the mid 40s and lows in the mid and upper 30s. Off
and on showers will be possible Tuesday into Wednesday, with
ensembles showing the potential for heavier precipitation next
week Wednesday.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Most terminals have seen good improvement and are now
under VFR. However, some of the northern terminals are still under
some foggy conditions. The fog should dissipate by noon. VFR
conditions are expected for the majority of Thursday. There is a
chance of light rain for the coastal terminals during the morning
hours and for the inland terminals in the afternoon. Guidance shows
that ceilings will begin to lower into the night and early morning
hours. Some locations, limited to locations around the Kitsap
Peninsula, may see some patchy fog developing into Thursday night
and Friday morning.

KSEA...VFR conditions have settled in at the terminal and are
expected through the majority of the day. There is a chance for
light showers to move through between 20-22Z. Winds will be between
4 to 6 kts from the south/southeasterly direction. Ceilings are
expected to start trending downwards after 3Z and trend toward MVFR
by 15Z into the terminal ahead of a weather system.

.MARINE...A weak front will approach the region today, dissipating
as it moves into the coastal waters. Although marginal, there
remains some potential for this system to bring wind gusts to 25
kt to portions of the coastal waters through this afternoon so
have issued a small craft advisory for the outer coastal zones
this morning.

A stronger frontal system will move into the region Friday into
Saturday and will bring more widespread advisory strength winds
to the coastal waters and portions of the inland waters, like the
eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Northern Inland Waters.
Gales will also be possible for portions of the northern coastal
water zones as this system approaches. These southerly winds will
allow for steep seas to develop across the coastal waters on
Friday. Winds will switch to westerly in the wake of the front on
Saturday and will remain breezy across the coastal waters and
along the Strait of Juan de Fuca into Sunday as a low pressure
system pushes inland over BC/WA. Seas will build towards 15-19 ft
across the coastal waters on Sunday as a larger wave group arrives
from the west. High pressure will then build back into the coastal
waters early next week, promoting lighter winds and gradually
subsiding seas. Additional disturbances look to approach the
coastal waters near midweek. 14

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak front passing across the area may bring some
light showers, but attention is turning to Friday and Saturday with
a much stronger weather system expected to bring more significant
precipitation to Western Washington. With strong warming with this
system, expect snow levels to dramatically climb to around 7000 to
9000 feet during the bulk of the heavier rain on Saturday. This,
combined with the heavier rainfall, will result in rises on rivers
across the region. While the precipitation forecast continues to
fluctuate a bit run-to-run, 2 to 3 inches of rainfall appear most
likely. However, high end potential amounts would reach into the 4
to 5 inch range across portions of the Olympics and the northern and
central Cascades. As a result, a flood potential outlook (ESF) has
been issued for Whatcom, Skagit, and Snohomish counties, in
addition to the previously issued outlook for Mason County. These
areas see the greatest threat of river flooding during the late
Saturday and Sunday time period. Other area rivers will continue to
be monitored for flood potential.
