Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
329 PM EST Tue Nov 28 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure builds into the area and remains in place through
Thursday. A series of weak low pressure systems will produce chances for
precipitation Friday, Sunday, and early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level shortwave pushes through the area this evening
allowing for any residual snow showers in the area this afternoon
and evening to dissipate shortly after sunset. At the surface, high
pressure builds in from the southwest as a large low pressure
system to the northeast over Southeast Canada pushes further away
from the area. This will continue to allow for a tight pressure
gradient through the overnight period. A brisk W/WNW flow advects
some of the coldest air seen thus far this season into the area.

Low temperatures tonight will be in the lower to middle 20s for much
of the area. The NYC metro will see temperatures around 30.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure continues to build into the area on Wednesday
with mostly sunny skies and dry conditions expected. While the
pressure gradient slowly relaxes, a brisk W/WNW wind at 10-15
mph with some gusts up to 20 mph will continue to advect cool
air into the area. As a result, high temperatures during the day
on Wednesday will only rise into the middle to upper 30s for
much of the area. Some areas along the coast may near 40
degrees, about 10 degrees below average.

Another cold night is expected Wednesday night with lows in the low
to middle 20s for much of the area. Coastal areas and the NYC metro
should drop to around freezing.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A warming trend on Thu as a weak thermal ridge builds in and the
flow aloft flattens. This will result in a 10 degree jump in temps
from Wed. The NBM was used.

A srn stream wave moves thru on Fri. The modeling is in pretty good
agreement with this feature. This should produce a round of rain
across the area, ending by Sat mrng per the 12Z guidance. The sys is
progressive and lacks strong advection, so mainly a lgt to mdt
rain swath is expected attm.

There is a chance for some shwrs or lgt rain on Sat with swly flow
aloft. However, chances are relatively low with mid lvl dry air to
overcome. Pops are in the 20 percent range for Sat.

Mild Fri and Sat and the NBM was used. Highs in the 40s to around 50
expected attm.

Continued mild on Sun with highs still in the 40s and 50s. A nrn
stream trof begins to dig down on Sun, allowing weak low pres to
develop off the coast. This sys will result in chances for rain on
Sun.

The upr trof may dig into the region Mon and Tue, allowing another
low to take shape. Model uncertainty is high this far out, so the
consensus approach with the NBM was used. However, there is the
potential for this portion of the fcst to turn out colder, with
perhaps some wintry pcpn at least across the interior.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /21Z TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure slowly builds in from the west.

VFR through the TAF period. A chance of light snow showers/flurries
though 29/00z. Chances of any obstructions to visibility and MVFR
ceilings are low.

West winds around 20kt with gusts 25-30kt slowly diminish this
evening and early tonight.  West winds around 10 kt
expected on Wednesday.

 ...NY Metro(KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Gusts of at least 30kt for KJFK/KLGA/KEWR will be most likely
during the period of through 29/00z. During this same period, KTEB
could occasionally gust to 30kt. Isolated gusts possible overnight
but winds are expected to diminish.

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...

18z Wed-Thu: VFR.

Fri: VFR in the morning, MVFR or lower in rain in the afternoon
and night.

Sat: VFR.

Sun. Chance of rain or showers. MVFR or lower possible.

forecasts, can be found at: https:/www.weather.gov/zny/n90<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A gale warning remains on the ocean waters through tonight with
gusts upwards of 35-40 kt expected. Small craft advisories also
continue for the sheltered and non-ocean waters tonight with
gusts upwards of 30 kt. The pressure gradient relaxes a bit on
Wednesday to allow for conditions to drop below gale force.
Small craft conditions will be likely on the ocean with gusts
near 25 kt during the day and seas near 5 feet. Non- ocean
waters should largely remain below small craft conditions but an
occasional 25 kt gust can`t be ruled out. Seas may allow small
craft advisories conditions to continue on the ocean through
Wednesday night.

Mrgnl sca seas on the ocean Thu thru Sat, otherwise, winds blw sca
lvl on all waters. Some stronger nely winds possible on Sun as low
pres develops in the ocean. A sca for all waters is possible.
Conditions improve on Mon behind the sys.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
