Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
253 PM PDT Sun Jun 2 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Atmospheric river pattern over Western Washington will
continue through Tuesday, consisting of two separate waves of
heavier rain moving through the area. The first will continue until
early Monday morning and the second will start Monday evening and
continue into Tuesday. The second wave will be weaker than the
first. Upper level ridging builds over the area Wednesday and will
remain in place through at least the weekend, bringing dry and much
warmer weather to the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>As per expectations, the
radar has filled up with echoes with much of W WA seeing
precipitation as of this writing. That said, forecast continues to
be on track. Will reiterate key points for the short term forecast
period before engaging in more detailed discussion.

...Key Messages for Upcoming Active Weather Pattern...

* A late season atmospheric river pattern will develop today and
  continue with breaks through Tuesday.

* Heavy rainfall amounts of 3 to 5 inches in the mountains, with
  possible 6 inch event totals over the southern slopes of the
  Olympics, and 2 to 4 inches along the coast.

* Moderate to heavy rainfall of 1 to 2 inches across the lowlands
  during this timeframe.

* Snow levels above 6500 feet will promote additional runoff with
  several area rivers flowing out of the Cascades forecast to enter
  action or even minor flood stage. A Flood Watch remains in effect
  across portions of Western Washington.

The front currently over the area is only the first of two systems
that are expected throughout this event. Even though the front will
pass through W WA and move into E WA by late this afternoon/early
this evening, the parent upper level low moves in quickly
thereafter, ensuring persistent wet conditions tonight and much of
Monday. Latest deterministic forecasts having a difficult time
showing it, but ensembles clearly suggest perhaps a little bit of a
break...or at the very least an easing up of activity...come Monday
evening or Monday night, as there is the tiniest of gaps between the
exiting low and the next incoming front. That is not to say that the
CWA will dry out, but at the very least will see a dip in PoPs for a
narrow 6-8 hour window. The next frontal system makes its way into W
WA late Monday night/early Tuesday morning and will continue for
much of the day before tapering off Tuesday evening and Tuesday
night. Does not appear to be as much QPF with this system as with
the first one but this one-two punch of AR-style systems will still
merit keeping an eye on hydro concerns...which will be discussed
below. Also meriting vigilance will be burn scars within the area.
Although not expecting any significant activity there at this time,
continued monitoring will be necessary should precip amounts or
rates exceed those currently forecast. All of that said, the
inherited Flood Watch will remain in place without any alteration.

Along with precip, could see some breezy to locally windy conditions
with occasional gusts throughout the short term with each of these
frontal passages. Wind speeds do not look to merit any headlines at
this time, however this combination of heavy rains and increased
winds may allow for isolated instances of either branches or
entire trees being felled. Caution is encouraged.

Wednesday the switch gets flipped over to the summer setting as
upper level ridging develops over the area, drying things out
quickly. This feature will be discussed more in the Long Term
Discussion.

As would be expected, temps will take a bit of a hit today when
compared to yesterday, with most locations only getting into the
upper 50s to lower 60s. Highs cool even further Monday as most
locations will sit in the upper 50s with the occasional spot hitting
60. A warming trend will kick off on Tuesday with highs returning to
the lower 60s followed by a significant bump up on Wednesday with
temps ranging from the mid 60s to lower 70s. Overnight lows will be
pretty static tonight and Monday night, generally in the upper 40s
to lower 50s. Clearing skies will help temperatures cool a little
bit Tuesday night, ranging in the mid 40s to around 50 with lows
Wednesday night looking similar.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...While a broad ridge over much
of the west will be responsible for at least the initial drying over
W WA, it is the mammoth ridge that will build over just off the
coast Thursday night and then progress slowly east that will be the
main driver...or in this case blocker...of the forecast. GFS tries
to be a little more progressive with this feature, having the ridge
axis push inland starting Saturday, the ECMWF keeps this feature
nearly stationary into at least the start of next week. Ensembles
continue to lean in the direction of the ECMWF and as such, could be
looking at enough of a dry stretch ahead to nullify or at least
minimize the benefit from the rains in the short term.

High temperatures will be the main discussion point for the
extended, although NBM still coming in a little too cool for what
this sort of pattern would dictate. Fortunately it does look like
low level flow...both surface and mostly at 850mb...should remain
generally onshore, helping to keep the expected increasing
temperatures in check. That said, the warming trend is expected to
continue with highs Thursday in the upper 60s to mid 70s, highs
Friday in the lower 70s to around 80 and mid 70s to lower 80s on
Saturday.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An approaching frontal system will continue to spread of
moderate to heavy rain, lower ceilings, and gusty winds to the area
through Monday. Southerly surface winds will increase with gusts
around 25 kt expected. Widespread MVFR conditions expected for much
of the day, with periods of IFR to LIFR possible in moderate to
heavy rain. With stronger southerly flow just off the surface and
initially weaker surface winds, expect areas of LLWS at many of the
terminals until the stronger winds mix down to the surface in a more
uniform distribution of speed. Winds remain gusty Monday with
continued low ceilings and restricted visibilities in rain.

KSEA...Expect predominantly low MVFR to IFR conditions with steadier
rain through the evening. Will maintain LLWS mention through 02z,
but expect surface winds to increase this evening so the stronger
surface winds will keep any shear below levels for including in the
TAF thereafter. Little change through the period with continued low
ceilings and restricted visibility and gusty southerly winds.  Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong front continues to advance across the region.
While a few gusts toward 35 kt may continue along the immediate
coastline, conditions have largely been covered by the ongoing
advisory. In addition to winds, seas remain rather steep and will
continue to build in response to the winds later today. Small craft
advisories also remain in effect much of the interior zones through
the evening or overnight with southeasterly winds now, transitioning
to westerly behind the front into Monday. Additional rounds of
advisory strength winds are expected late Monday and Tuesday with
the potential (30-50% chance) for gale gusts through the Strait of
Juan de Fuca.

Expect wind gusts to also increase across Puget Sound this evening
with around a 55% chance of advisory strength winds. While some
isolated gusts will be observed, not as confident that these will be
widespread or persistent enough. A better chance for the Sound will
be on Tuesday.

Overall, expect the pattern to remain active through the first half
of the week, with yet another frontal system expected to move across
the region on Tuesday. Latest guidance suggests the winds with this
next system could be stronger, with more widespread gales possible
across portions of both the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the coastal
waters. Seas are expected to build into the 10 to 13 ft range and
will remain rather steep with the dominant period around 8 or 9
seconds. Thus, even when the winds ease over the coastal waters,
advisories will need to continue.

High pressure then looks to build over coastal waters near midweek,
with gradually subsiding seas and a less active weather pattern.
Breezy northerlies may develop over the coastal waters, perhaps
leading to additional small craft advisories late in the week and
also maintaining steeper seas.     Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Today through Tuesday forecasted rain totals are still
3 to 5 inches for the Olympics and the Cascades, with the
possibility of 6 inch bullseyes along the southwest slopes of the
Olympics. Snow levels will be in the 7000 to 8500 foot range for for
the first wave of the atmospheric river and just a little lower for
the second round. West southwesterly flow aloft favors the heaviest
rainfall to be along the southwest slopes of the Olympics and the
Central Washington Cascades. Several rivers flowing out of the
Central Cascades and Southern Olympics are forecast to reach action
stage. The river with the best chance to reach flood stage is the
Skokomish River in Mason county. Even with some of the rivers only
reaching action stage, these levels would be records for this time
of the year. The flood watch for Skagit, Snohomish, King, Pierce,
Mason and Lewis county remains in effect.

In addition to the high flows on area rivers, the water
temperatures in the rivers continues to be very cold. Most rivers
flowing out of the Cascades are still in the mid 40s to lower 50s
for water temperature. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
