Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
259 AM PDT Wed Apr 2 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Troughing will continue over the region today,
maintaining unsettled conditions across western Washington. A high
pressure ridge will build inland Thursday through Saturday,
bringing dry and warmer conditions. Wet conditions are on track to
return by the end of the weekend and into early next week as
troughing returns.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Radar imagery early this
morning shows continued convergence zone shower activity east of
the Puget Sound, and high resolution forecast models show this
activity holding strong through the late morning. Elsewhere,
onshore flow will continue scattered shower activity throughout
the day with snow levels near 2500-3000 ft. Accumulation amounts
will be light, with up to a tenth of an inch of rain across the
lowlands and up to an inch or two of additional snow over the
mountains. Shower activity will taper off through the evening
hours as drier air enters the region. Cooler conditions will
persist today under southerly flow, with highs several degrees
below normal in the low 50s across the lowlands.

High pressure will build offshore on Thursday and amplify inland
through Saturday, allowing conditions to warm up and dry out with
plenty of sun. Temperatures will reach the 60s across the lowlands
by Friday, increasing into Saturday with potential (10% to 20%
probability) to reach 70 degrees east of the Puget Sound.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Rain will make a return to
western Washington by the end of the weekend, though models show
some disagreement over the timing. Ensemble consensus shows
precipitation spreading inland throughout the day Sunday, with
accumulations up to an inch. With warm temperatures in place, snow
levels will remain elevated on Sunday near 6000 ft. Troughing is
on track to continue into early next week, bringing in cooler
temperatures and periods of locally breezy conditions alongside
lowland rain and mountain snow.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An area of rain is impacting terminals primarily north
of SEA, with periods of RA as of around 230 AM this morning. This
should linger for the next few hours as it behaves somewhat like a
convergence zone. Winds have shifted to northerly at PAE and AWO but
remain southerly throughout the rest of Puget Sound. Northwesterlies
along the coast are bringing in additional showers. Mostly MVFR to
VFR cigs early this morning, with the expectation of continued MVFR
and VFR cigs into the rest of today. A turn to more northwesterly
winds is expected for more terminals this afternoon, generally after
03Z.

KSEA...MVFR at the terminal this morning, with southerly winds of 10
to 15 kts. The lower extent of the area of rain is clipping the
terminal, keeping cigs at 015 to 020 feet. Showers may linger in the
vicinity through much of the morning hours before breaking out to
VFR after 19Z. Winds will remain southwesterly at 5 to 7 kts before
turning to a northwesterly after about 03Z between 5 to 7 kts. High
res guidance seems to suggest that the duration of the northerly
winds will be limited, and suggest a return to south/southeasterly
flow around 07Z.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Winds through the Strait of Juan de Fuca have eased below
small craft advisory thresholds early this morning, with no
additional headline level winds expected in the near term. High
pressure will build into the area by the later half of the week.

Combined seas are in the 6 to 7 feet range, but will be decreasing
to 3 to 5 feet by Thursday as high pressure settles in. The next
time frame that could see headlines in terms of seas and potentially
stronger southerlies would be late in the weekend as the next front
possibly materializes later on Sunday.
