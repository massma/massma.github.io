Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
216 AM PST Fri Nov 29 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridging over the region will weaken enough
today to allow a weak disturbance to produce a couple showers
across coastal areas and the North Interior. The ridge will
strengthen over the weekend into early next week for dry
conditions and widespread night and morning fog. The ridge will
weaken enough during the second half of next week to allow for a
returning chance of precipitation across the area.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak disturbance passing
across the area this morning is producing enough cloud cover to
limit fog development somewhat north of Seattle. Most areas will
remain dry today, but a couple of showers will be possible along
the coast and near the Canadian border. High temperatures will
remain on the cool side...a few degrees below seasonal averages.
Upper level ridging begins to rebuild across the region tonight
into Saturday and remains in place through the weekend. Light
surface gradients and remnant low level moisture will likely allow
nightly fog and low cloud coverage to expand with time. This will
keep low temperatures across the lowlands mostly above freezing,
but will also keep daytime highs below normal.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Upper level ridging is
expected to remain in control through the first half of the coming
week for dry conditions and near normal temperatures. A couple of
disturbances riding over the top of the ridge may produce some
clouds, but precip chances look to remain mainly north of the
area. As we approach the second half of the week, some
deterministic model runs are advertising a weakening of the ridge
and begin to introduce some precip chances. However, it should be
noted that ensembles are generally in agreement with maintaining
a mean ridge position along the West Coast throughout the whole of
next week. So, it wouldn`t be surprising to see the PoPs presently
in days 6/7 of the default NBM forecast begin to get cut back as
we get closer to the middle of next week. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridging will keep flow aloft northwesterly
into the weekend. Surface winds are light and variable and this is
expected to persist at least into Friday morning before most
terminals return to southerly winds Friday afternoon...although
speeds will generally remain 5 kts or less.

Cigs are IFR to LIFR in most southern and central Puget Sound
terminals, with VFR along the Strait of Juan de Fuca and coastal
terminals. Fog has limited vsbys to a quarter of a mile or less
in these areas. These conditions will likely continue through much
of the morning hours, with gradual improvement beginning between
18Z to 19Z. Surface winds during this time will continue to be
light. Given the persistent pattern of having the upper level
ridge in place, fog will likely settle in once again tonight for
most inland terminals, generally after 06Z. The fog is not likely
to impact terminals along the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the
coast.

KSEA...LIFR cigs and a quarter of a mile visibility remains firmly
in place early this morning. These conditions will linger through
much of the morning hours, with a slow improvement trend beginning
around 18Z to 19Z. Cigs will lift to around 2000 ft by 21Z, then
there will be a window of VFR cigs thereafter until the fog settles
in again after 06Z. Surface winds today will be light and out of the
SSE.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will continue over the waters into the
weekend. Fog that has established itself throughout Puget Sound will
linger through the morning hours, limiting visibilities over the
central and southern portions of the Sound more. Winds will be light
through the weekend at or less than 5 kt from the southwest, with
wave heights of 3 to 5 feet building to 4 to 6 feet Sunday. A
potential disturbance early next week will bring seas up to 6 to 8
feet Sunday into Monday, but winds at this time are expected to
remain below 15 kt over the coastal waters.
