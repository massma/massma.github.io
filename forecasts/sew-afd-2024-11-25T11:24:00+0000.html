Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
324 AM PST Mon Nov 25 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper-low continues to churn off the PNW coast as
Monday brings active weather. Conditions will settle towards the
Thanksgiving holiday as guidance hints at the return drier weather
but cooler temperatures.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Good morning, western
Washington. Widespread showers are pushing northward across the
CWA this morning. The stubborn upper-low off the coast continues
to eject shortwaves into our area perturbing the environment.
These features are subtle but noticeable in the 700mb levels as
guidance paints a vorticity lobe along with them, serving as a
source of rising motion and precipitation generation. Showers will
remain in today`s forecast with snow levels around 3,000 to 4,000
ft. The pattern will gradually progress as the upper-low slides
inland over OR late overnight. Showers are to linger but lessen
in coverage. Temperatures will top out in the mid 40s to near 50 F
with lows in the mid 30s to lower 40s.

Transient ridging will track overhead and out ahead of an area of
stronger high pressure centered over the NE PAC on Tuesday-
Wednesday. We`ll trend drier due to these features but still can`t
rule out meager shower activity with the best chances over the
Cascades. Highs for both Tuesday and Wednesday will top out in the
mid to upper 40s with 30s to lower 40s overnight. Can`t rule out a
few locations flirting near freezing on Wednesday night.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Slight PoPs will remain
in the forecast. This can be attributed to another subtle
shortwave breaking off the ridge centered over the NE PAC,
entering around Thursday-Friday. Guidance appears to have upper-
level ridging as the dominate feature into the weekend. Cool
overnight lows are likely during this forecast period. And with
longer nights and residual surface moisture, patchy fog is
possible as well.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak low remains centered to the southwest of the
region, maintaining a weak southwesterly flow pattern over the area
today. Light rain and light low-level flow will maintain low MVFR to
IFR ceilings this morning and into early afternoon. Abundant
moisture and steady rainfall will also bring visibility restrictions
through the morning. Rain begins to taper to showers later today
with some lifting in ceilings around late afternoon. This will be
short lived as moist low levels and light winds will bring lowering
ceilings again tonight.

KSEA...Steady rain early this morning will bring VFR ceilings
lowering into MVFR range 12-19z with increasing chances of VFR
ceilings into the late afternoon as rain tapers to showers. Light
northerly surface winds become northeast this morning, before
turning southerly by this afternoon.                         12<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak low to the southwest will maintain generally light
winds as it meanders around offshore today before pushing inland and
falling apart tonight. Winds generally light with this system,
though some local gusts around 20 kt will be possible this morning
over the southern and inner coastal zones in closest proximity to
the low.  Otherwise, seas remain dominated by relatively short-
period components but remain short of both overall heights and
steepness to preclude the need for any small craft advisories at
this time.

Looking ahead, high pressure will likely rebuild over the waters
around Tuesday and hold through much of the week ahead. This will
maintain relatively uneventful weather conditions over the waters.
Expect seas to again build late in the week as the high pressure
breaks down.                                                 12<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>he Skokomish River will remain near flood stage
into Monday with light precipitation overnight. The river will
slowly recede beginning Monday night dropping below flood stage
Monday night into Tuesday. The river will remain below flood stage
the remainder of the week.

For the rest of the rivers no flooding is expected with no
hydrologically significant precipitation in the forecast. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
