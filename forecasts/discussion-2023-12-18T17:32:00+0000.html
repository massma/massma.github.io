Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
1232 PM EST Mon Dec 18 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
Strong low pressure passes through the area today. The low then
tracks north into southeastern Canada tonight with high pressure
slowly building in during Tuesday. High pressure will then remain in
control through the upcoming weekend.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A broad 982 mb low is situated along the Hudson River. The low
will continue to shift eastward across New England through this
evening. The strongest winds now exist across eastern New
England with the intense LLJ ahead of the low. Winds have
shifted to the W-WNW across western Long Island and SW CT on
westward behind the low. Immediately ahead of the low winds will
still be out of the S-SE until the front associated with the low
passes through this afternoon.

One last area of rain will move across the region early this
evening, shifting to our northeast by late in the afternoon. The
rain will be moderate at times, but additional freshwater
flooding is not expected as rates will generally be 0.25 inches
per hour or less.

Residual flooding along rivers and stream across NE NJ and
Lower Hudson Valley will continue for the rest of the afternoon.

Gusty W-WNW winds this afternoon early evening may gust 25-35
mph at times.

Highs for the day have likely been reached at most locations
with slightly cooler air working its way in behind the low.
More seasonable air does not arrive until tonight and Tuesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The low will be north of the area tonight with a brief break in
precipitation. Wrap around moisture on the back side of the
storm with the approach of a closed mid-level will bring a
chance of rain/snow showers well NW of the city late tonight
into Tuesday morning. Dry for Tuesday night with the flow aloft
becoming anticyclonic and surface high pressure building in.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
Upper level low over the eastern Great Lakes region will weaken
into a trough as it moves toward the forecast area. A weak area
of low pressure looks to form along the frontal boundary
offshore, and a blocking pattern will then set up as the trough
becomes an upper level low once again and will interact with the
weak surface low offshore, becoming vertically stacked by the
middle of the week. With a blocked pattern over the region, the
surface high that builds in during Tuesday night will remain over
the area through next weekend. This will sustain a period of dry
weather Wednesday through Sunday.

The area will be on the eastern side of the high during much of the
week, with a northwest to northerly flow for much time. This will
lead to seasonable temperatures with highs in the 40s.

&&

.AVIATION /17Z MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
HIGH IMPACT AVIATION EVENT TODAY...

Strong low pressure approaches tracks near the region this
morning and then lifts to the north and east, dragging a cold
front through this afternoon.

Low pressure is currently over the region, allowing for a bit of
a lull in the conditions. Some terminals are improving to VFR
and the winds have dropped off a bit. However, once the low
tracks east of the region, conditions should deteriorate once
again. Do not think they will be as bad as earlier, but MVFR
conditions or lower is expected and winds will pick up again,
with gusts around 30 to 35 kt range. This should occur around
17Z for the metro terminals and KHPN and KSWF, 18Z for KISP and
KBDR, and 20-21Z for KGON.

Widespread IFR/LIFR conditions this morning with improvement behind
the departing surface low and cold front in the afternoon.
Conditions are forecast to improve to MVFR in the afternoon,
becoming VFR by late afternoon for all but KGON, which should
follow by early evening. Cigs on Tuesday may occasionally go
MVFR.

Peak S/SE winds occurring now thru mid morning or so, 20-30kt
G30-50kt, with strongest along the coast. Slow improvement late
morning through the afternoon, with winds veering to S/SW, then
W/NW around 20kt G30-35kt in the afternoon into early evening.
Winds will then gradually diminish and back to the SW G20-25kt
Monday evening. Gusts 20 to 25 kt linger through Tuesday.

     NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Isolated 45 to 50 kt gusts thru 15Z this morning, especially at
KJFK and KLGA.

Gusts after 13Z could be more occasional than frequent until low
passes to the east in the early afternoon.

Timing of flight categories could vary by 1-2 hours.

OUTLOOK FOR 12Z TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...

Tuesday: Mainly VFR, brief MVFR cigs possible. WNW G20-25kt in
the afternoon.

Wednesday through Friday: VFR.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Gale warnings are now in effect on all waters except the Western
Sound where an SCA is in effect through tonight. Gales are
likely this afternoon and early evening, especially immediately
behind the passage of the low. SCA conditions are then expected
to continue tonight. Ocean seas are expected to range roughly
up to 16-21ft through the evening.

Conditions should be below advisory thresholds by early Tuesday
morning on the non-ocean waters. Seas remain elevated on the
ocean through at least the end of the week as long period swells
from an offshore storm keep waves elevated.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The flood watch remains in effect this afternoon. Additional
rainfall should likely just be on the moderate side with rates
around 0.25 inches per hour or less.

Residual river flooding will then continue tonight as levels
subside. Afterwards, no hydrologic impacts expected through next
weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Coastal flood warnings continue for southern Queens, southern
and eastern portions of LI and coastal CT, and expanded for NE
NJ as widespread moderate coastal flooding is likely with the
high tide this early this afternoon. This includes the tidally
affected rivers, particularly Hudson and Hackensack rivers,
where the surge is favored to be forced upstream by the strong
southerly flow.

Elsewhere, minor to locally moderate coastal flood potential exists
for NE LI and northern portions of NYC.

Heavy rainfall and/or runoff coinciding with this afternoon`s high
tides will exacerbate street and property flooding issues along the
coast and tidally affected rivers.

Along the ocean beachfront, potential exists for 12-16 ft breakers
today (8-12ft for NYC beachfront), which combined with elevated
water levels, will likely result in widespread dune erosion and
scattered overwashes.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
