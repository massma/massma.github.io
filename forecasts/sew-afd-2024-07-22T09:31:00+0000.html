Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
231 AM PDT Mon Jul 22 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure continues to move east of Washington,
with deep low pressure to the northwest in British Columbia,
influenced by a strong and slow moving upper level low. This
pattern will bring various degrees of onshore flow throughout the
week. Persons in western Washington can expect to see various
degrees of cloud cover in the morning, with sunshine in the
afternoon throughout the week. Temperatures return to around
average with highs in the 70s for much of Puget Sound through the
work week. Aside from a slight chance of showers in the north
Cascades Wednesday afternoon, remaining areas will continue to
stay dry this week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>IR satellite imagery shows
quite a bit of clearing overnight as a weak shortwave trough
exited the region yesterday evening. With a strong upper level
ridge over Idaho/Montana up into Alberta, and a strong upper
level low south of Alaska/west of British Columbia, flow aloft
will be southerly to southwesterly. The bad news: the southerly
flow will continue to bring upper-level smoke into Washington from
wildfires in Oregon (but will gradually begin to clear out west
to east as the low slowly moves east). The good news: cooler ocean
air has begun to make its way back into Washington as of Sunday.
Much of that air is being wrapped around the base of the low as
the trough axis digs down to northern California, with a little
bit of a negative tilt.

The forecast will sound like a broken record with the slow
movement of the previously mentioned upper-level features. For the
next few days, cloud cover will fill in most inland areas during
the overnight and morning hours, clearing out by late morning and
afternoon. The marine push Monday morning may be accompanied by a
post frontal convergence zone over Snohomish County. Threat of
showers is extremely low, but will most likely see lower cloud
cover for a longer duration this morning.

The low will swing an embedded shortwave trough over northern
Washington/southern British Columbia Monday night/Tuesday morning.
Despite good vorticity advection, this trough will past through
dry (but will increase cloud cover early Tuesday morning). An
embedded shortwave trough will bring more cloud cover Wednesday
afternoon (mix of clouds and sun).

For temperatures and winds, Monday will be the coolest day in the
interior/Puget Sound with highs in the low to mid 70s. This will
increase to the mid and upper 70s Tuesday and Wednesday. Highs
along the coast and waters will top out in the 60s. Lows will drop
into the 50s for all areas (few 40s at higher elevations). A few
gusty winds to 20 mph are possible areas along I-5 north of
Everett (with a strong push down the Strait of Juan de Fuca by
Monday afternoon/evening). Outside of this, winds will remain out
of the northwest at 5 to 10 mph.

Side note: in addition to smoke aloft, HRRR near-surface smoke was
still picking up on heavier smoke close to the Cascade crest due
to new wildfires (and fires east of the crest). Added haze to the
forecast for these areas affected by the fires. The onshore flow
will push the majority of this smoke east of the Cascades.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...The upper level ridge will
propagate eastward as the low moves onto land Wednesday into
Thursday. As the low moves ashore, an embedded shortwave trough
will swing over the northern part of Washington. This will be the
best chance of precipitation in the forecast, with a chance of
showers in the north Cascades Thursday morning. Will have to also
monitor the chance of thunder with this activity (temperatures
aloft are still a bit warm). The flow aloft will become more
northwesterly by Friday. This will weaken some of the onshore
flow from the Pacific, resulting in less cloud cover from any
marine push that tries to materialize. High temperatures as a
result will start to lean back towards 80 degrees next weekend.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level troughing digging southward over the
northeastern Pacific will produce southwest flow aloft over
Western Washington today. Low level onshore continues at the
surface and will become moderate to strong later today into this
evening. The combination of onshore flow and increasing low level
convergence will produce a mixed bag of conditions...with low MVFR
ceilings most likely along the coast, in the Strait of Juan de
Fuca, and around portions of Puget Sound. Ceilings will lift by mid
afternoon except in the vicinity of KPAE where a convergence zone is
expected to develop with possible shower activity.

KSEA...Somewhat difficult forecast this morning with clouds
expect to form in place over Puget Sound as marine air mass takes up
residence over the lowlands of Western Washington. A period of MVFR
ceilings is probable between 12Z and 18Z before lifting to VFR this
afternoon. Surface winds S/SW rising to 6 to 11 knots...then veering
to N/NW this evening. Current best estimate of shift to northerly is
around 03Z tonight.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow will continue through much of the week with
high pressure situated over the offshore waters and lower pressure
situated east of the Cascades. A series of weak troughs moving
into British Columbia will increase onshore flow at times over the
next several days. Models remain consistent with another strong
onshore push late this afternoon and evening for another round of
gales in the central and east strait. Small craft advisory
northwesterlies are expected in the adjacent waters of Admiralty
Inlet for a period this evening.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Red Flag warnings have been cancelled for fire
weather zones 658 and 659. The threat for dry thunder and gusty
winds has shifted well east of these zones, so cancelled the
warning for that reason. Going forward, an intrusion of marine
cool air and high relative humidities will set up Monday morning.
This onshore pattern will vary, but continue into Tuesday as well
and throughout the remainder of the week but. This reprieve will
decrease fire weather concerns going forward.

.CLIMATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Seattle officially ended the 80 degree and higher
streak on Sunday. The Sunday high of 77 degrees is the first high
in the 70s since July 3rd. This makes the 17 day streak from July
4th to July 20th the longest streak of temperatures of 80 degrees
and higher since records began at SeaTac. The previous record was
15 days (set back in 2015 and in 1977).
