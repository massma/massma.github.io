Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
750 PM PDT Fri Jun 7 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Generally dry and warm conditions will persist over
the area into early next week. A more typical June pattern
becomes more likely mid week onward with morning clouds, and near
normal temperatures. Wetter weather is possible late in the week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Temperatures still mainly in
the 70s this evening under clear skies in W WA this evening. Echoes
from KLGX over the nearshore waters certainly not precip, as current
satellite imagery has both nearshore and outer waters also under
clear skies.

As life continues under the upper level ridge into the weekend, the
forecast remains on track and see no need for any evening updates.
For additional forecast details, please see the Previous Discussion
section below.

From Previous Discussion...Sunny skies and warmer temperatures this
afternoon will shift smoothly into a clear pleasant evening with
morning clouds along the coast and a clear mostly sunning morning
for the remaining area. The Upper level ridge over the area tonight
will begin to shift into Eastern Washington Saturday. Low level flow
will fully turn onshore in the afternoon with temperatures similar
to today over the interior with another round of 70s to lower 80s.
Temperatures along the coast will cool back down into the 60s.

A weak upper level trough with limited moisture will reach the area
Sunday with increasing onshore flow, more cloud cover Saturday night
into Sunday and a chance showers and a 15-20% chance of isolated
thunder in the Cascades Sunday. High temperatures on Sunday will
trend to the low to mid 70s over the interior and low to mid 60s
along the coast. Monday will trend drier with temperatures remaining
above normal for the interior, into the low to mid 70s and mid 60s
for the coast.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...From Previous
Discussion...Onshore flow and a the potential for a weak system mid
week will elevate the potential for light morning showers or drizzle
along the coast and Olympic Peninsula and cooler temperatures
overall with highs in the interior in the mid 60s to upper 60s. The
grand ensemble continues to highlight elevated probabilities of an
upper level trough pattern over the Pacific Northwest late in the
week - hinting at a shift towards a wet end to the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Winds aloft shifting to southwesterly later this evening
and tonight as upper level ridge axis crosses W WA. Some portions of
the CWA may continue to see northwesterly winds aloft into tonight,
mainly terminals east of the Sound including SEA up to BLI.

VFR conditions in place throughout the area and expected to persist
for the TAF period. The only exception however may be KHQM with 30-

.MARINE...Prevailing northerly flow over the coastal waters tonight.
High pressure will slide east of the Cascades on Saturday with a
return of stout onshore flow. A SCA remains in place for the central
and eastern sections of Strait of Juan de Fuca. High pressure over
the NE Pacific will maintain onshore flow through Sunday with
continued SCA level winds through the aforementioned areas. A front
is forecast to cross western WA Monday night.

Seas 4 to 6 feet but rising to 8 to 10 feet Saturday night. Seas are
expected to fall well-below 10 ft on Monday but may rise again
towards midweek.
