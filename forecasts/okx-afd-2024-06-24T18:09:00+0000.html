Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
209 PM EDT Mon Jun 24 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure builds in through Tuesday. The high settles south
of the area Tuesday night as a warm front lift north Tuesday
night. A cold front will move across from Wednesday night into
Thursday morning. High pressure will then return for Thursday
night into Friday, and move off the northeast coast on Saturday
as a frontal system begins to approach. The system moves through
Sunday into Sunday night.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TUESDAY/...
The forecast is on track this afternoon.

A warm and gusty afternoon is expected with temperatures much
cooler than previous days. Highs will be in the upper 70s and
lower 80s. Peak sustained winds today of 20 to 25 mph, with
peak gusts of 30 to 35 mph.

There is just a slight chance for showers across northern areas
of the Lower Hudson Valley this afternoon as the upper level
low and trough slowly move east. With dew points dropping into
the 40s and 50s, don`t expect too much to reach the ground.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH 6 PM TUESDAY/...
Winds diminish overnight with the loss of daytime heating this
evening. A much more comfortable night with lows in the upper
60s to upper 50s across the area tonight. Lows may be a couple
of degrees too high if the air mass is drier than forecast.
Winds may stay up enough so that radiational cooling may not be
maximized.

The high will continue to build in for Tuesday and settled to
the south of the area by Tuesday afternoon and evening. Winds
shift to the west then southwest by the afternoon, allowing for
a rise in temperatures. Highs should top off in the upper 80s to
lower 90s for much of the area. With dew points still in the
50s region-wide, heat headlines are not anticipated.

A warm front lifts north of the area overnight Tuesday,
allowing for an increase in dew points and for a return to warm
overnight lows, ranging from the middle 70s in the metro area,
to upper 60s in the interior.

&&

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
Key Points:

* Temperatures will remain near to just above normal, with
  Wednesday the warmest and most humid day of the period.

* A slow moving cold front may bring locally heavy rainfall
  from late day Wednesday through Wednesday night.

Global guidance continues to remain in fair agreement for next
week and as such, there has not been much change to the forecast
with this update. The National Blend of Models was followed
closely.

An amplifying northern stream upper trough moves through the
Great Lakes and northeast Wednesday through Thursday with a
surface low tracking across southeastern Canada. Deep southwest
flow ahead of the systems cold front will bring warm and humid
air into the region Wednesday with inland temperatures expected
to be in the lower to mid 90s. Wednesday may be marginal for
heat advisories as a few locations across northeastern New
Jersey will have heat indices nearing 100. Precipitable water
values increase to 1.75 to 2.0 inches Wednesday into Wednesday
night. Strong upper lift with increased surface and elevated
CAPE, along with instability will result in thunderstorms by ate
Wednesday into Wednesday night with the potential for moderate
to heavy rainfall. And there is a chance of excessive rainfall
across the lower Hudson Valley into northeastern New Jersey.

High pressure moving out of central Canada Thursday into
Thursday night will be a cooler and drier airmass to the region
as dew points drop into the lower to mid 50s Thursday through
Friday.

Another frontal system approaches Saturday with a warm front
moving north, with increased humidity, and a chance of showers
and thunderstorms into next weekend.

.MARINE...
Winds are expected to increase behind a cold front that will move
through this morning. SCAs already up for the ocean, but SCAs have
been issued for non-ocean waters for late this morning for the
harbor, south shore bays, and western sound and early this afternoon
for Peconic and Gardiner`s bays and the central and eastern sound as
the cold frontal passage is expected later in these areas. Winds
diminish tonight, and non-ocean waters SCAs come down at 2 am
Tuesday, or sooner if winds diminish quicker than forecast.

SCA on the ocean waters have been extended due to the combination of
the 25 to 30 kt wind gusts expected today and the slowly diminishing
waves that are expected to remain above 5 ft through tonight. Waves
should be diminishing at the start of the near term period (this
morning) at 4 to 7 ft.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
No hydrologic concerns through Tuesday night expected. There is
a chance for locally heavy rain from late day Wednesday
afternoon into Wednesday night ahead of a cold front that moves
through Wednesday night.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
A high rip current risk continues today for all ocean beaches
mainly due to an energetic S swell. The risk lowers to moderate
on Tuesday as seas subside with an offshore wind trajectory for
much of the day.

&&

.OKX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CT...None.
NY...High Risk for Rip Currents until 8 PM EDT this evening for NYZ075-
     080-081-178-179.
