.PREV DISCUSSION... <span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>/issued 219 AM PDT Tue Apr 15 2025/

.SYNOPSIS...Dry conditions through Friday with ridging across
Western Washington for the majority of the week. High temperatures
will generally be above normal through Friday. Troughing will
slide southwards Saturday into early next week for cooling
temperatures and potential showers.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Mainly clear conditions
early this morning across Western Washington with a few high
clouds, as well as patchy low clouds along the north coast. A mix
of clouds and sunshine again today as the upper ridge located over
the Pacific Northwest flattens. Temperatures will be in the upper
50s to upper 60s. Troughing will slide southwards across the
interior Rockies on Wednesday, however, ridging will once again
build offshore for continued dry conditions. A few more lower
clouds may develop early Wednesday morning, mainly across the
Southwest Interior. The upper ridge will then continued to build
offshore into Thursday. Temperatures will likely be a degree or
two cooler on Wednesday, before warming into the mid to upper 60s
again on Thursday.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...The upper ridge axis will
shift over Western Washington on Friday. Friday will likely be the
warmest day of the week for most areas, with highs in the mid 60s
to low 70s. Ensembles are then in good agreement that troughing
will develop from British Columbia into the northern Pacific
Northwest Saturday into early next week. This will result in
cooling temperatures and increased cloud cover. In addition,
shower chances return later Saturday into Monday, primarily in the
Cascades, as well as favored convergence areas. Temperatures over
the weekend will be near to slightly below normal for the area. JD

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure rebuilds over the northeastern Pacific
and will remain situated over the region through Friday. A weak
front will try and move through the waters over the weekend. Wind
speeds have eased enough to allow wind-driven SCA headlines to
expire.

Combined seas over the coastal waters will be in the 10 to 12 foot
range today and remain that way into Wednesday. Seas for the
outermost coastal waters could reach 14 feet late Tuesday into
Wednesday. Small craft advisory for rough bar conditions at the
Grays Harbor Bar for tonight into Wednesday added to the forecast.
Small craft advisory for the coast for seas remains into Wednesday.
