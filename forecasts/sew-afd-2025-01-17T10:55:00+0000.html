Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
255 AM PST Fri Jan 17 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure at the surface and a strong ridge aloft
over the Pacific coast will dominate the weather into the middle of
next week, bringing dry conditions and colder temperatures.
Overnight lows are expected to fall below freezing over much of
Western Washington this weekend before temperatures gradually
recover by midweek.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>While not as widespread as 24
hours ago, fog once again is the most prominent weather feature this
early morning. While the usual suspects are reporting the usual
quarter-mile visibility, such as Olympia, Shelton and Chehalis,
there are some sites seeing dips ranging from 1 mile to 4 miles.
This distribution well exemplifies the descriptor patchy. The plus
side of the fog is that it is serving to keep temps from falling too
far, although obs from 2 AM still show a pretty wide distribution of
temps in the lower to mid 30s, even dipping into the upper 20s in
Bellingham and Port Townsend.

The upper level ridging responsible shows little inclination on
moving, at least throughout the short term, as the ridge axis stays
nearly stationary over the Pacific waters. This will help to dry
conditions out, restraining any additional fog development to late
tonight/early Saturday morning before eliminating it from the
forecast for the remainder of the near term period. Unfortunately,
these drier conditions will allow for overnight low temperatures to
dip even further this weekend with widespread sub-freezing
temperatures expected. Overnight lows tonight and Saturday night are
expected to be in the upper 20s to lower 30s. The coldest night is
expected to be Sunday night into Monday morning. Apparent
temperatures may sink below 25 degrees over portions of W WA both
Saturday night and Sunday night, which may end up warranting a Cold
Weather Advisory headline in some locations. These cold starts will
have an impact on daytime highs, with most locations only getting
into the lower 40s each day...with the exception of along the coast,
where mid 40s will be possible.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The ridge axis gradual shifting
eastward will finally bring it to the WA coast Monday morning, which
will initiate some flattening and starting a very incremental
warming trend. This will be aided by an infiltration of clouds
starting Monday night as an incoming front gradually approaches.
Models show this trough swinging through Tuesday...however
deterministic models show quite a gulf in their solutions. The GFS
keeps unsettled weather into Wednesday while the ECMWF not only
brings the trough through dry early Tuesday, but has yet another
ridge following close behind. Ensembles overall favoring what would
ultimately be a dry solution, however the range in PoPs starts to
grow from here and extending into the remainder of the forecast
period...peaking on Friday. It needs to be noted that the range in
solutions for Friday tops out with a PoP around 30 pct with a mean
nearly half that. Regardless, the NBM has latched on to this
uncertainty and has introduced PoPs, albeit weak ones, starting
Wednesday and carrying through the second half of the new week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge offshore will gradually build into
Western Washington today with northwest flow aloft continuing.
Residual moisture from earlier convergence remains in place across
the interior this morning and this has largely delayed the formation
of low ceilings. As this gradually erodes away this morning, there
remains the opportunity for pockets of IFR stratus to form. Combined
with the building ridge, increasing low level northerly flow will
act to dry the air mass for widespread VFR across the area this
afternoon and evening. Clearing skies and light surface winds will
allow for the development of patchy LIFR fog/stratus
tonight...especially across south Puget Sound and the Southwest
Interior.

KSEA...Remnant convergence zone moisture has delayed IFR stratus
from forming as of 10Z. Current thinking is to scale back the
mention of low MVFR or IFR stratus to just tempo between 13Z and
17Z. Otherwise, VFR will prevail with skies scattering out and
clearing by mid to late afternoon. Developing pattern tonight favors
keeping LIFR fog out of the TAF for now with better chances for
freezing fog south and west of the terminal. Surface winds northerly
increasing to 9 to 12 knots by this afternoon.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A broad surface ridge over the coastal and offshore
waters will build inland this weekend with light offshore flow
developing and persisting into Monday. A weak system is expected to
dissipate offshore on Tuesday with offshore flow increasing again
thereafter as a strong surface ridge rebuilds over the interior of
British Columbia and east of the Cascades.

Coastal seas near 10 feet over the outer waters will subside later
today and remain under 10 feet into the middle of next week.
