.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No changes made in this evening`s update. Benign
conditions are expected tonight as mid to high level clouds stream
overhead. Low temperatures are forecast to fall into the upper
40s to mid 50s. The previous discussion remains below along with

.SYNOPSIS...Generally dry and warm conditions will continue over
the area into early next week. A more typical June pattern becomes
more likely mid week onward with morning clouds, and near normal
temperatures. A return to a more wetter pattern will be likely at
the end of next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...An upper level ridge
will continue to shift into the Pacific Northwest this afternoon
for dry and warm conditions. Current satellite imagery shows a
few high clouds moving in from the south with flow aloft mainly
southwesterly. Afternoon high temperatures will climb into the
upper 70s and lower 80s for the interior, while locations near the
coast and other areas of water will stay in the mid 60s to lower
70s with increasing onshore flow in the latter half of the day.

A weak upper level trough with meager moisture will nudge into the
area into Sunday with increasing cloud cover and a slight chance
of showers in the Cascades. Overall, interior locations should
remain dry. Onshore flow will continue, with high temps along the
coast in the low 60s, and high temps in the interior in the low to
mid 70s.

Heading into Monday, a more zonal pattern will develop with dry
conditions and temperatures remaining above normal for the
interior, in the low to mid 70s, and lower 60s for coastal areas.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...A shortwave will move
north of our area Tuesday into Wednesday for increased cloud
cover and increased precipitation chances mainly in the northern
portion of our region. Cooler temps will return as well with highs
in the low to mid 60s. Cluster and ensemble guidance continue to
depict an upper level troughing pattern into next weekend, with
the return of wet and cooler conditions.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge axis will exit the area tonight,
allowing for a weak upper trough to move across western WA on
Sunday. At the surface, a weak frontal system offshore will
dissipate as it approaches the coast tonight. Mainly high clouds
associated with the system continue to stream overhead this evening,
although some mid-level clouds are possible. Conditions are VFR
across the area terminals and will remain so through at least into
tonight...with most locations remaining VFR for the duration of the
TAF period. MVFR ceilings will be likely for terminals typically
favored for stratus such as HQM and PWT...maybe getting into OLM but
there is a level of uncertainty there. These sites will return to
VFR conditions expected near 18Z. Surface winds will generally
remain light and variable. Increasing onshore flow tonight will
allow for stratus to push inland on Sunday, likely making its way
into the southern Sound terminals between 13-16Z.

KSEA...VFR through the TAF period. W/NW wind persisting at 4-7 kt.
Winds look to transition back to the S/SW around 5-10 kt overnight
and persist through Sunday morning. 14/18<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will remain situated across the
northeastern Pacific through the weekend. A weak front approaching
the coast will dissipate as it moves onshore tonight. Onshore flow
will increase this evening with gales expected through the central
and eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca. Another strong westerly push
down is expected down the Strait on Sunday night. Inherited gale
watch will remain in place with no alterations. Onshore flow will
prevail through Monday as high pressure remains situated offshore.
Another front will cross the area waters on Tuesday, with high
pressure expected to build back into the coastal waters in its wake.

Seas over the coastal waters continue to hover between 3-5 ft this
evening before increasing to 7-9 ft tonight into Sunday. Seas will
then subside again Monday, hovering between 3-6 ft before building
back towards 6-8 ft Tuesday night. 14/18<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
