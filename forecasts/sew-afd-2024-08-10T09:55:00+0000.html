.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Warmer conditions will linger today for the interior
with cooler conditions along the coast. Afternoon and evening
thunderstorms over the Cascades with areas of lofted smoke and
haze will continue as well. Onshore flow will bring much cooler
conditions Sunday into next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>There`s another threat of
showers and isolated thunderstorms in the Cascades today (near the
crest) with upper level troughing over the Pac NW. Winds aloft are
westerly and we should see less smoke/haze over western WA from
nearby wildfires. Temperatures will be in the 70s to lower 80s.
Heat Risk will be mostly Minor with a few pockets of Moderate in
the interior. The coast will be cooler and in the 60s with NW
winds.

A second. deeper, trough will be over the region on Sunday and
Monday for cloudier and cooler conditions. Max temps on both days
will only be in the 60s to lower/mid 70s (interior). There`s an
additional threat of showers and isolated thunderstorms once again
near the Cascade crest. 33

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Moving through the week
ahead, the air mass will remain cool as an upper low drops down
from Canada. Temperatures will remain mostly in the 60s and 70s or
a few degrees cooler than average. Isolated showers will be
mostly tied to the Cascades. A few ensemble members are showing
potential for warmer temps (80s again) by the weekend with
deeper, southerly flow over the area. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West-northwest flow aloft as upper-level ridging is
just offshore. Marine stratus is pushing well inland this morning
with LIFR to IFR cigs (200-900 ft) observed from the coast as far
inland as KTIW & KPWT. This activity is forecast to cross into the
Puget Sound terminals by 12z and remain widespread in coverage
before diminishing around 18z and returning to the coast by 21z. VFR
is likely to reign area-wide in the afternoon (with the exception of
KHQM) but another widespread push of marine stratus is likely
overnight into Sunday morning.

KSEA...VFR currently but marine stratus is inbound. IFR cigs will
arrive between 10-12z with a 15% chance of LIFR cigs. Conditions are
to improve to VFR around 17-18z and will remain that way for the
remainder of the day. However, an additional round of marine stratus
is in the cards to arrive overnight into Sunday morning. Surface
winds primarily out of the SW between 5-10 kt throughout the TAF
period.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>1032mb NE Pacific surface high is well offshore but is
maintaining onshore flow here across area waters. A SCA has been
issued for the central/eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca & the
northern/central outer coastal zones starting this afternoon. Winds
are to diminish into Sunday morning but steep 6 to 9 ft seas are
likely to persist for the aforementioned outer coastal waters before
relaxing into the second half of the day on Sunday. Generally benign
conditions are expected to set up there after for the next few days
as of now.
