aviation and marine sections below for updates to those
forecasts.

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cooler and damp conditions expected for the start
of the week before warmer temperatures return by Wednesday and
Thursday. Precipitation chances return to the forecast by Friday
into next weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Widespread stratus is
apparent on satellite early this morning thanks to continued
onshore flow. A weak frontal system is still expected to drop
into western Washington from the north later this evening,
bringing light rain and through Tuesday morning. Light rain
accumulations are expected, as well as high snow levels above
5,000 to 6,000 feet. Today is likely going to be the coolest day
of the week, with highs in the upper 50s. Beyond Tuesday
morning, expect some lingering showers in the Cascades, but
generally drying conditions elsewhere.

An upper level ridge returns to the PNW by Wednesday, beginning a
warming trend. Temperatures will climb into the mid to upper 60s,
setting the stage for a warmer day still on Thursday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Absolutely
pleasant temperatures are expected on Thursday as highs climb
into the upper 70s for much of Puget Sound and surrounding
Cascade Valleys. Even coastal locations will reach the upper
60s. Low 80s are expected in the southwest interior. Enjoy it,
as temperatures will moderate somewhat into the upper 60s and
low 70s on Friday as increased onshore flow resumes with the
ridge moving east. This will allow the next frontal system to
move into western Washington on Friday into Saturday. Exact
track of the low will have implications on how much
precipitation the region receives, but at this point in the
forecast cycle, the forecast calls for the bulk of the rain to
fall in the Cascades and northern Olympic coast.
