National Weather Service Seattle WA
356 AM PDT Sat Aug 24 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level trough over Western Washington shifting
east late this afternoon and tonight. Upper level ridge building
Sunday shifting east Monday. Another upper level trough moving
through Monday night into Tuesday. Stronger upper level ridge
building Wednesday and remaining over Western Washington into
next weekend with temperatures above normal by the end of the

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
deformation zone over most of the area this morning. Doppler radar
has rain north of a line from Hoquiam to Olympia. Temperatures at
3 am/10z where they have been for the last 24 hours, in the mid
50s.

Deformation zone on backside of the upper level trough elongating
and spreading south this morning before shifting east and
weakening this afternoon as the upper level trough moves east.
Rain over most of the area this morning will change to scattered
showers this afternoon. Shower activity coming to an end along the
coast later this afternoon. With the clouds and rain it`s going
to be another cold August day with highs only in the upper 50s to
mid 60s.

Upper level trough continuing to move east tonight with showers
coming to an end by the early morning hours. Low level onshore
flow combined with plenty of residual low level moisture will keep
skies mostly cloudy. Lows in the lower to mid 50s.

Upper level ridge building over Western Washington Sunday. Low
level flow remaining onshore. The combination of late August
sunshine and subsidence from the building upper level ridge will
eventually dissipate the low level moisture for partly sunny skies
in the afternoon. Even with the ridge building, the minimal
sunshine until the afternoon hours will keep highs in the mid 60s
to lower 70s. Still a few degrees below normal.

Upper level ridge over Western Washington Sunday night shifting
east Monday as an upper level trough drops out of the Gulf of
Alaska and heads toward Western Washington. Trough still well
offshore Monday afternoon. With more sunshine highs in the mid 60s
to mid 70s. Lows Monday morning in the 50s.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Extended models showing good
run to run consistency. Upper level trough moving through Western
Washington Tuesday bringing showers back to the forecast and
dropping highs into the 60s. Trough moving east Tuesday night
with a stronger upper level ridge beginning to build over the area
Wednesday. The upper level ridge will remain over Western
Washington into next weekend. Models hinting at weak offshore flow
Friday which would warm highs into the mid 70s to mid 80s. Slow
warming trend before that with Wednesday highs mid 60s to mid 70s
and 70s and lower 80s Thursday. Summer is not over. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough over the region will
gradually shift eastward today with the flow aloft becoming
north to northwesterly. The air mass remains moist at all
levels with areas of IFR/LIFR conditions in light rain persisting
across Western Washington through midday Saturday. Gradual
improvement is expected late today with precipitation diminishing
and ceilings lifting to VFR near or after 00Z.

KSEA...Deteriorating conditions expected this morning as
precipitation continues to wrap around an upper low in the region.
Periods of IFR or low MVFR ceilings in light rain are expected
through midday before gradual improvement later this afternoon.
Surface winds S/SW 7 to 11 knots with a few higher gusts this
morning.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A trough of low pressure over the waters will weaken and
shift eastward today. Gusty southerlies will continue over portions
of the interior waters this morning as the surface low weakens and
departs. Weak high pressure will briefly rebuild over the waters
tonight through Sunday before a weak frontal system arrives Monday
night into Tuesday. Increasing onshore flow behind that system will
likely lead to some headlines for portions of the coastal waters and
the Strait of Juan de Fuca. More typical late summer diurnally
driven onshore flow resumes in the second half of the upcoming week.
