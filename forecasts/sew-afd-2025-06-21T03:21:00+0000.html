Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
821 PM PDT Fri Jun 20 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A wet and cooler weather pattern will continue into
Saturday as an upper level low moves through Western Washington.
A building upper ridge will lead to drier and warmer conditions
Sunday through Tuesday before a weak trough produces a cooling
trend around the middle of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Shower coverage and
intensity is beginning to wind down this evening as the core of the
upper level low responsible for the instability shifts east of the
Cascades. We`ll see a relative lull in precip for a few hours this
evening before some stratiform precip wrapping around the backside
of the system moves across Western Washington late tonight into
Saturday morning. This may be our best and only chance in the near
term for widespread measurable precipitation. QPF through Saturday
evening remains in the quarter to half an inch range with locally
higher totals in the mountains. Drier conditions begin to return
late Saturday with a warming and drying trend still on track Sunday
through Tuesday. No forecast updates are anticipated this evening.
Previous discussion follows with an update to the aviation portion.

An upper level low is beginning to move into western Washington this
afternoon, with increasing shower activity into the evening. Recent
radar imagery depicts these scattered showers across the interior,
with most of the activity located within the South Sound.
Additionally, the air mass continues to be unstable this afternoon,
with a chance of thunderstorms possible into early this evening.
Latest hi- resolution guidance highlights most of the possible
thunderstorm activity to likely be in the SW interior, although
cannot rule out a thunderstorm over Puget Sound. The primary impacts
from any thunderstorms that do develop will be heavy downpours,
lightning, and some small hail or graupel. Snow levels will drop to
around 5000 ft with a few inches of snow possible on the higher
peaks in the mountains.

The upper level low will continue to move through western
Washington into Saturday, with the bulk of the shower activity
falling tonight into Saturday morning. Shower activity will
gradually decrease through Saturday, although a few showers will
likely linger in the mountains. High temperatures will remain in
the mid 60s for the interior.

The upper level low will move eastward on Sunday, allowing for
conditions to dry out across the area and warm up slightly, with
temperatures in the upper 60s and low 70s across the interior.
Conditions will continue to dry out as a broad high pressure
builds on Monday across the region, with temperatures warming into
the mid to upper 70s across the interior, with areas along the
water in the mid 60s.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...High pressure will remain
over the area over midweek, with temperatures in the interior
warming into the low to mid 80s, likely being the warmest day in
this stretch. Uncertainty lies going into the end of the week,
where ensembles are hinting at cooler but drier conditions, but
also a chance of some weak systems crossing the area. For now,
have kept mostly dry conditions resuming throughout the long term
period with high temperatures in the upper 60s into lower 70s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper-low will meander over the region through
Saturday. Variable flow aloft is prevailing as a result. VFR area-
wide this evening with areas of MVFR in showers and a few localized
lightning strikes. Mostly VFR slated to remain this evening but MVFR
cigs will return between 08-12z Saturday with steadier rainfall
filling in across western Washington overnight. Areas of IFR
possible as well in heavier precipitation. VFR returns by Saturday
afternoon as conditions trend drier.

KSEA...VFR with showers in the vicinity of the airfield. VFR slated
to remain tonight, but steadier rain will arrive with MVFR cigs
around 10-11z Saturday. Southerly wind gusts up to 20 kt are
possible around this time. MVFR expected throughout the remainder of
Saturday morning before gradually lifting to VFR during the
afternoon.

.MARINE...Low pressure meandering over the region through Saturday.
It`ll progress off and away on Sunday, with high pressure building
in its wake. A weak system will dissipate over the coastal waters
Monday. High pressure building again Monday night and Tuesday before
an additional system arrives midweek.

A SCA remains in effect for the central/eastern Strait while a new
SCA has been added to the outer coastal waters for winds as well
starting late tonight. These headlines should be allowed to expire
on Saturday, with the Strait of Juan de Fuca in the morning followed
by the outer seas in the afternoon.

Seas building to near 10 feet later tonight into Saturday for the
outer coastal waters before subsiding Saturday night.
