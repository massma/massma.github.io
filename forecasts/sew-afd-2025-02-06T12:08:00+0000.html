Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low spinning offshore will continue to
bring rain and snow showers to western Washington through the
morning hours. Shower activity will taper this afternoon for
clearing conditions this evening. Cold temperatures will settle
into the region by Friday morning as the upper trough pushes
inland over the Pacific Northwest. A weak system will bring
additional chances of snow showers to the area over the weekend.
Cool temperatures and periodic chances of snow showers will
persist into next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A mix of conditions
persists out across western Washington early this morning as a
low offshore continues to spin moisture into the region. Showers
will continue to stream into area through the early morning
hours, before tapering by this afternoon.

Conditions have generally remained rather mixed across the Sound
as temperatures have continued to fluctuate overnight. Areas
south of King county have mainly reported rain or a rain/snow mix
and areas across northern King/Snohomish counties and further
northward have reported snow. Latest observations show marginal
temperatures across portions of the central and south Sound as of
3AM/11Z, with areas from Centralia to south Seattle reporting
temperatures in the mid 30s. Meanwhile, areas generally north of
Seattle have been reporting temperatures closer to freezing, and
as such have already seen snow fall overnight. Winds will be
another factor to monitor heading through the morning hours. Winds
across the south and central Sound have transitioned to mostly
south-southeasterly overnight, which could continue to support
warmer temperatures for areas south of King County. Meanwhile,
areas from northern Snohomish county up to the border continue to
see northerly winds, which have helped support cooler temperatures
from the upper 20s to near freezing.

Overall, the main determination for precipitation type through
early this morning will continue to be the temperature profile, so
will be monitoring this closely over the next few hours. Winter
weather advisories remain in effect through late this morning for
much of the interior lowlands as an additional inch or two of
snow will still be possible in any heavier precipitation bands
that do develop.

Hi-res guidance indicates shower activity tapering by the
afternoon hours as the low offshore sinks southward. Clearing
skies this afternoon and evening will bring significant cooling to
the region by Friday morning, with many lowland locations
expecting to see overnight lows dip into the teens and 20s. Cold
Weather Advisories remain in effect for the Cascade foothills and
the Puget Sound lowlands extending from King County up through
Whatcom county through Friday morning.

Chances for snow showers will increase again late Friday into
Saturday morning as the upper low moves inland to the south and
pushes some wrap around moisture back up into the region. A weak
shortwave will follow close behind, dropping into the region from
the north and will likely keep shower activity going across
western Washington through Saturday. While confidence in regards
to exact snow amounts and intensity of showers remains low at this
time, amounts at this time generally look to be lighter. Temperatures
into the weekend will continue to trend below average, with highs
on Saturday in the upper 30s to low 40s and overnight lows
expected to be in the mid 20s to near freezing.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Western Washington will
remain under northerly flow aloft as upper troughing looks to
persist over the Pacific Northwest and upper level ridging builds
over the northeastern Pacific and Gulf of Alaska in the long term.
Temperatures will remain below normal and look to cool heading
into midweek, with highs expected to be in the 30s and overnight
lows consistently dipping down into the 20s and teens. Weak systems
embedded in the northerly flow aloft may bring additional chances
for snow showers at times through early next week. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow turning more westerly aloft as a
shortwave continues to bring precipitation across W WA. Mixed
conditions out there this morning with a rain/snow mix mainly in
the southern/central Puget Sound, and snow showers up north near
KPAE. Fluctuating temperatures across the area will enable this
wintry mix of precipitation into the later morning hours, with
most places seeing MVFR/IFR conditions with lower visibilities
around 1-3SM. Hi-res guidance shows banding continuing until
15z-17z, before precipitation slowly dissipates. Conditions will
recover to VFR by the afternoon (20z-23z) as the lower levels dry
out with offshore flow.

KSEA...MVFR conditions early this morning as a rain/snow mix
continues to impact the terminal with occasional brief
visibility reductions around 6SM. These showers will persist until
14z-16z, where conditions will slowly improve to VFR into the
afternoon and remain that way throughout the TAF period. Southerly
winds this morning winds 8 to 12 knots will shift more northerly
after 18z, with speeds generally remaining elevated around 10 to
12 knots through the evening.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface trough remaining over the coastal waters will
gradually move inland on Friday with light offshore flow
continuing throughout the area waters. Calmer and benign marine
conditions expected into the weekend, with combined seas staying
at 3 to 6 feet into early next week.
