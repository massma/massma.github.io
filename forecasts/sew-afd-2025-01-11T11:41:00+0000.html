Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The passing disturbance continues to shift eastward,
with lingering showers in a Puget Sound Convergence Zone early
today. High pressure begins to build over the region, but a few
showers will continue at times, especially in the mountains and
near the coast. With a strong ridge building in next week, expect
mostly dry conditions and developing morning fog each day.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Lingering showers continue in
association with a Puget Sound Convergence Zone across portions of
southern Snohomish and northern King counties early this morning,
but expect that this will gradually wind down toward daybreak. The
strong ridge of high pressure continues to amplify over the
Pacific and will work it`s way closer to the region, but it`s not
quite here yet. This will keep the door left open for some weak
disturbances to maintain some light showers at times. Chances will
be best along the coast and in the mountains, but we`ll see a
predominantly dry trend. Some patchy ground fog is possible in
spots this morning given the moist surface after yesterday`s rain,
especially in the areas that can get a little bit of clearing.
However, any cloudy skies could preclude more significant fog
development this morning. A different scenario is likely for
Sunday and especially Monday, however, with the ridge axis
shifting more solidly in place over the region. Expect periods of
morning fog both days and a return of rather cool nights with
skies clearing and the air mass drying under the high pressure.
This could bring rather widespread temperatures near the freezing
mark both mornings. This isn`t much of a deviation from normal
temperatures for this time of year, but nevertheless reflects
cooler conditions than we`ve seen for most of the season thus far.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...High pressure remains
firmly in place across the western U.S. for the start of next
week, and perhaps longer. Ensemble guidance does suggest at least
some potential for an upper low tracking eastward to perhaps be
close enough across British Columbia to at least flatten the ridge
and at least bring some renewed precipitation chances across the
region. Overnight temperatures remain rather cool through the
week, mostly in the lower 30s with a few upper 20s in the coolest
spots. Daytime highs will remain in the 40s, with some increasing
cloud cover later in the week due to the previously mentioned
disturbance to the north.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge building offshore with north
northwesterly flow aloft. At the surface high pressure building in
through Sunday.

Mixed bag of ceilings out there early this morning. MVFR ceilings
are the most dominate with local VFR conditions and LIFR fog and
stratus over the Kitsap peninsula. Little change through the
morning with widespread VFR ceilings this afternoon after 21z.
Areas of LIFR fog forming after 08z tonight.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings this morning could briefly scattered at times
12z-14z. Ceilings improving to VFR midday. Good chance of LIFR fog
after 11z Sunday morning. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
