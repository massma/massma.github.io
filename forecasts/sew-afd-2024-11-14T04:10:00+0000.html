Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
810 PM PST Wed Nov 13 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Showery and cool conditions will persist through
Thursday before an upper ridge brings a short break in the active
weather to the area on Friday. Cool and unsettled conditions
return over the weekend and persist into early next week as
another system moves into western Washington.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No major changes have been
made this evening. Expect a few showers to linger overnight with
scattered showers to persist tomorrow.

As the storm system slowly shifts eastward, showers will
continue across the region overnight and will slowly decrease in
coverage throughout the day Thursday. The bulk of the remaining
moisture with this storm system is on track to fall over the Olympic
Peninsula and North Cascades, where potential remains for 1 to 3
additional inches of liquid. The lowlands are on track to see
rainfall totals between now and Thursday of half an inch to an inch.
Higher elevations of the North Cascades are still on track to see
significant snowfall, while the higher peaks elsewhere will see a
few inches of additional snow accumulation.

The upper trough axis will shift across the Pacific Northwest late
Thursday into Friday, allowing for conditions to mostly dry out.
High resolution model guidance suggests some isolated light shower
activity could linger throughout the day on Friday under moist north
to northwest flow aloft. Temperatures are on track to top out in the
upper 40s across the lowlands on Friday, bringing snow levels down
to roughly 2500 ft. With cold road temperatures, the Cascade Passes
could see light snow accumulations on Friday from any showers that
develop over the mountains.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...The region will see
little relief from wet conditions, with another storm system moving
in on Saturday. Widespread precipitation and breezy winds will once
again move into western Washington by Saturday afternoon, with
ensembles favoring unsettled conditions to continue through
Thursday. Snow levels will rise above 4500-5000 ft on Saturday as
tropical moisture moves in, then fall to 2000 ft by Monday morning
with continued shower activity. The Cascade Passes will likely see
accumulating snowfall towards the end of the weekend, though exact
amounts are uncertain at this time. Precipitation is favored to
continue into Tuesday, with a low (10% to 15%) probability of a
rain snow mix across the lowlands early Tuesday morning.

Ensemble cluster analysis shows a strong signal for high pressure
building over the western US by mid-week next week, which would
usher in dry and warmer conditions. However, lots of uncertainty
still remains in the timing and intensity of the high pressure if it
does develop. Long range climate models favor a shift to above-
normal temperatures by the end of next week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Scattered showers will persist throughout the night
with periods of steadier rain in stronger cells. Outside of
showers/storms, winds will be sustained out of the southwest at
10-15 kt (gusting to 25 kt) through tonight, reducing to 10 kt
Thursday morning. Ceilings will continue to remain MVFR/VFR
through the afternoon, but will become widespread MVFR tonight
into a majority of Thursday. The thunderstorm threat has
diminished for the evening, though convective cells are still
moving onshore and may be capable of producing heavy rain along
the coast.

KSEA...VFR cigs at the terminal presently, but may not be long
lived as bands of showers approach from the west. Rain has
returned and ceilings will likely decrease to MVFR throughout the
night, especially from 09Z onward. South to southwest winds at 10
to 15 kt will continue before easing somewhat after sunrise
tomorrow.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Behind the frontal boundary, ridging will rebuild offshore Thursday.
Winds will diminish tonight into Thursday morning. Next chance of
gusty winds will be with another system Saturday into early next
week. Hazardous seas of 16 to 20 feet will begin to subside later
today, but will remain at or above 10 feet into early Friday. A
return of double digit seas is expected later this weekend as
another larger swell train arrives behind the weekend frontal
system.

HPR<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Rivers will continue to rise tonight, particularly through the
Olympic basin and North Cascades, where the heaviest rainfall has
been observed. Rivers will crest tonight into early tomorrow before
beginning to fall. The Skokomish River, which is currently at
moderate flood stage, will crest tonight and is expected to fall
below flood stage Thursday night. The Bogachiel river has crested
well below flood stage.

Currently no additional river flooding is forecast at this time.
Another system will move through the area this weekend. Snow levels
will fluctuate, ranging from 2000 to 4000 ft throughout the weekend.
The amount of flooding will depend on temperatures and the QPF
forecast as it evolves through the week, which will continue to be
monitored.
