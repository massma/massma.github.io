Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
813 PM PDT Tue Jul 30 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cloudy skies and light showers will persist
throughout the day as an upper trough exits to the east. A high
pressure ridge will build over the western US through the rest of
the week and into the weekend, allowing for above normal
temperatures and dry conditions to return.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Most areas is covered in mostly cloudy skies (few areas
seeing pockets of clearing in the Kitsap Peninsula and some slight
scattering in the rest of western Washington). Forecast remains on
track, please see discussion below for more details (as well as a
refreshed aviation section).

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow throughout
the morning has maintained cloudy skies across western Washington,
with light showers and drizzle lingering over higher terrain
mainly north of the Puget Sound. Cloud cover will persist well
into the afternoon with only partial clearing, which will limit
temperatures across the region several degrees below normal in the
low 70s.

Dry conditions will return on Wednesday as zonal flow develops
aloft and high pressure develops offshore. Cloudy conditions will
scour out by the morning, allowing for temperatures to return to
near normal, near 70 degrees along the coast and the upper 70s to
lower 80s further inland.

High pressure will continue to build northward into western
Washington through the remainder of the week as a strong ridge
amplifies over the western US. Much of the region will see a
return of elevated temperatures paired with dry conditions, with
the lowlands east of the Puget Sound on track to reach 90 degrees
by Friday afternoon. Friday will be the hottest day of the period,
with moderate (orange) HeatRisk potential across many lowlands
surrounding the Puget Sound. The immediate coast will remain much
cooler in the 70s with a persistent belt of marine stratus
expected to cool things off under weak onshore flow.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Ensembles remain in good
agreement over hot and dry conditions through the weekend and
into early next week. Weak troughing offshore is likely to cool
things off a few degrees over the weekend, with an influx of cloud
cover likely on Saturday. Low-level onshore flow will also likely
limit high temperatures over the weekend and into next week,
though above normal temperatures will continue. Forecast models
continue to show the potential for thunderstorms over higher
terrain triggered by weak shortwaves moving across the region, but
confidence is low at this time.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft with an upper ridge building into
Western Washington. Generally VFR/MVFR this evening with lingering
stratus due to residual moisture. Stratus will lower again tonight
into Wednesday morning with widespread MVFR/IFR cigs for the
interior and LIFR/IFR cigs for the coast. Vsbys will also lower at
times along the coast. Cigs will slowly scatter late Wednesday
morning into early Wednesday afternoon to VFR. Light southerly winds
tonight will transition more N/NW Wednesday afternoon.

KSEA...VFR mid clouds this evening. Cigs will lower again with
stratus tonight (generally between 07-09z) with MVFR/IFR cigs into
Wednesday morning. There also remains a 10% chance of LIFR cigs
between 12-16z Wednesday. Cigs will slowly improve to VFR between 19-
22z Wednesday. Light SW winds into tonight will transition more N/NW
midday Wednesday. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

MARINE...High pressure offshore will steadily build over area
waters throughout the week. Diurnally driven northerly winds will
develop over the coastal waters through the rest of the week, but
will look to remain under advisory/warning threshold. Seas 3 to 5 ft
through the week before building towards  6 to 7 ft for the outer
coastal waters. Combined with a short period there could be steep
seas, especially farther offshore in the outer water zones
throughout the weekend. Seas return back to 3 to 5 ft into the
beginning of next week.
