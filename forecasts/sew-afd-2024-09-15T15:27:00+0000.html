Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
827 AM PDT Sun Sep 15 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Upper level trough over the area moving south later
today and tonight. Western Washington between features Monday with
the trough well to the south and an approaching front still north
of Vancouver Island. Front moving through Tuesday night with rain
out ahead of the front spreading over the area Tuesday. Upper
level ridge trying to build in later Wednesday into Thursday but
the ridge isn`t strong enough to eliminate the possibility of systems
brushing the area into next weekend.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
mostly clear skies along the Pacific Coast, however cloud cover
remains in place over most of the interior of western Washington
as an upper level trough is positioned directly overhead. Low
clouds continue to squeeze out some drizzle and light rain over
the central Puget Sound and Kitsap Peninsula moving down towards
Tacoma as of 830 AM. Temperatures across the region are in the low
to mid 50s.

Upper level trough over the area this morning will sink south this
afternoon. Southerly flow aloft along the front side of the trough
will keep the threat of showers in the forecast for the Cascades
through the afternoon hours. For the remainder of the area shower
chances coming to an end this morning with some clearing this
afternoon. Air mass still slightly unstable and with some daytime
heating will see some cumulus bubble up but at this point it does
not look like these clouds will develop enough to create
thunderstorms. Sunshine this afternoon for the lowlands but the
air mass aloft is still a little cool. This will keep highs below
normal, in the mid 60s.

Upper level trough continue to move south tonight pulling the
cloud cover and shower chances away from the area. With the
clearing skies, light flow in the lower levels and plenty of low
level moisture areas of fog developing especially in the fog prone
areas like the Southwest Interior and interior river valleys. The
clearing skies will also allow temperatures to drop into the 40s
in most locations overnight. Possible G3 magnetic storm early Monday
morning which could produce an aurora over Western Washington
especially the northern portion.

Break in the weather Monday with Western Washington between the
upper level trough well to the south and a cold front moving down
the British Columbia coast. Fog will dissipate by midday with
sunny skies. Monday the warmest day in the next week but highs
still a little below normal, mid 60s to lower 70s.

Increasing clouds late Monday night as the front continues to
move southeast down the British Columbia coast. The front will
still be offshore Tuesday afternoon with rain out ahead of the
front reaching the coast in the morning, spreading to the interior
in the afternoon. Highs will be on the cool side with the
increasing rain. in the upper 50s to mid 60s.

Front moving through Western Washington Tuesday night with rain
changing to showers. Felton/LH

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Confidence in the
extended forecast not very high this morning with the
inconsistent model solutions. Post frontal trough over the area
for most of Wednesday keeping at least a chance of showers in the
forecast. Weak upper level ridge trying to build Wednesday night
and Thursday but the building ridge is being suppressed by a
trough to the north. This is a change from previous model runs
where the trough was much weaker. Shortwave moving through
Thursday night or Friday. Previous runs had a much stronger ridge
building next weekend with the low level flow turning offshore.
This scenario has been pushed back into Sunday night and Monday
with another upper level trough moving through Western Washington
Saturday. Given the lack of consistency in the model runs the
forecast for Thursday night through Saturday is a broad brush
mostly cloudy/partly sunny slight chance of showers. High
temperatures remaining below normal through the period. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft becoming more variable by this
evening as an upper-low centers overhead. Widespread MVFR/IFR
conditions in low stratus this morning with isolated areas of LIFR
fog. Cigs are favored to improve to VFR by 20-22z with clouds mostly
scattering out. Light winds this morning increasing out of the north
through the afternoon. Low stratus and patchy fog again possible
early Monday with another marine push but stratus should be of
lesser coverage.

KSEA...MVFR cigs this morning in low stratus with some light drizzle
falling through the clouds. 20% chance of IFR cigs through 17z. Cigs
will slowly lift and scatter around 20-22z to VFR conditions. Light
easterly winds this morning increasing out of the north by the
afternoon between 5-10 kt before again lessening tonight into early
Monday. Low stratus appears possible again Monday morning to a
lesser degree but should burn off readily by the afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Benign conditions expected for Sunday with winds remaining
out of the northwest over the coastal waters. Gusts up to 20 kt are
possible in the far outer coastal waters today. The next best chance
for headlines exists Monday evening for the Central/Eastern strait
as onshore gradients increase. The forecast is not a slam dunk as of
now but something to monitor going forward. High pressure over the
coastal waters for much of the upcoming week aside from a weak low
entering late Tuesday.

Seas 5 to 7 feet today through Tuesday, dropping to 3 to 5 feet
before rising again around 6 to 8 feet as a disturbance moves
through around midweek.
