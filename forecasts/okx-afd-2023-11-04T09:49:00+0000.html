Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
549 AM EDT Sat Nov 4 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
A broad area of high pressure will remain over the area through
Monday. Low pressure will track across eastern Canada Monday
night into Tuesday, dragging a cold front through the area
Tuesday afternoon. High pressure will briefly nose down from
eastern Canada Tuesday night into Wednesday, then a series of
weak lows will move across from Wednesday night into Friday.

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The fcst is on track. High pres extended from the Atlc to the
sern CONUS this mrng. A swly return flow will continue today.
However, low pres, albeit weak, will develop off of the
Carolinas, altering the pres field and limiting any aftn
strengthening of local winds. Modeled mid and high clouds appear
to be on track per the latest stlt pics, bkn-ovc at times today
filtering the sunshine. The NBM was followed for temps with
highs in the upr 50s to around 60.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH MONDAY/...
No rain tngt but mid and high clouds still around limiting the
radiational cooling potential. Stuck with the NBM for temps as
a result. Light winds become nwly towards mrng as they respond
to the offshore low. NW winds increase a bit on Sun with breezy
wx right along the shore by aftn. Still no rain. Expecting a
break in the mid cloud deck attm per the modeling as the band of
Pacific moisture is shunted swd. This should translate into
highs a little warmer Sun and lows a little cooler Sun ngt.
Thickening clouds by Mon aftn ahead of the next sys, but still
dry wx for the day. Winds come around to the S and draw a little
llvl moisture into the area by sunset. Went with the NBM with
local adjustments for temps.

&&

.LONG TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...
A nearly zonal flow across the country will send a fast moving
frontal system through the Northeast Monday night into Tuesday. The
associated warm front and best thermal forcing bypasses the area to
the north and west Monday night, followed by a cold frontal passage
Tuesday afternoon. Due to limited moisture and weak forcing, not
expecting anything more that a few passing showers during this time
with light if any rainfall.

Ahead of the front a strengthening low-level southerly jet will
bring a surge of warm air northward along with a gusty southerly
flow Monday night into Tuesday ahead of the cold front. In addition,
this will allow for highs to get into the 60s Tuesday and perhaps
even around 70 across the NYC metro. This will be short-lived though
with a shot of cold air to follow with temperatures dropping to
several degrees degrees below normal on Wednesday.

Thereafter, there remains some uncertainty as a series of frontal
waves will traverse the front which stalls across the Mid Atlantic.
The first wave is forecast to bring a bout of rain to the area late
Wednesday into Thursday. There is some uncertainty with the
magnitude of these waves and whether the area remains on the cold
side of the frontal boundary. For the time, have stayed close to a
consensus approach using the NBM for winds and temperatures during
this time. Expect fluctuations in the forecast with temperatures and
rain chances for the second half of the week.

&&

.AVIATION /10Z SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
High pressure remains just offshore while a cold front moves into
northern NY state and northern New England on Saturday.

VFR through the TAF period.

SW winds along the coast early this morning will continue to
gradually weaken and veer to the WSW. Outlying terminals will be
light and variable. Winds will then begin to back to the SW and S at
less than 10 kt from late morning into the afternoon. For tonight,
winds will wither become light and variable or veer to the WNW at
less than 5 kt.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Wind speeds could be a few kt higher at times early this morning,
especially at KJFK.

OUTLOOK FOR 08Z SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...

Saturday Night through Monday: VFR

Tuesday: Mainly VFR. Chance of showers and MVFR.

Wednesday: Mainly VFR. Chance of showers at night.

.MARINE...
Winds and seas are expected to remain blw sca lvls thru Mon due
to high pres in the region. A strengthening S/SW flow Monday
night into Tuesday ahead of a cold front will bring the
potential for G25-30kt, highest on the ocean with seas building
above 5 ft. Winds shifting WNW Tuesday afternoon behind the cold
front will result in lingering SCA conditions Tuesday night.
High pressure then briefly follows for mid week.

.HYDROLOGY...
There are no hydrologic concerns through the middle of next
week.
