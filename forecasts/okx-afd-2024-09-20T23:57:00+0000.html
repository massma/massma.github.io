Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
757 PM EDT Fri Sep 20 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
Low pressure will remain south and east of Long Island through
Saturday, then head slowly farther out to sea into early next
week. Meanwhile, high pressure will nose in from the northeast
this weekend and remain in control through at least early
Tuesday. A frontal system may then approach and move through
during mid to late week.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SATURDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showers associated with the western periphery of a storm system
over the western Atlantic have shown little eastward movement.
Thus, have adjusted already low PoPs across far eastern LI down
a bit more. If anything gets into these areas, its likely not
until after midnight.

The next chance for showers along the New England coast will
work south and west overnight as a mid level vort rotates
around the upper low centered just SE of New England. This
should also bring mostly cloudy skies to areas to the west, but
those area should also remain dry. Latest guidance also does not
show much rainfall getting into far eastern areas and it very
well could be a dry overnight.

As weak CAA begins on N-NW flow, low temps tonight should range
from the lower 60s in the metro area and along the coast, to
the mid 50s well inland.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM SATURDAY MORNING THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT/...
Cooler conditions expected on Sat as nigh pressure noses down
from the NE, with wind gusts 20-25 mph mainly from NYC east, and
continued chance of showers across far ern sections. Interaction
with the upper low and weak troughing approaching from the Great
Lakes will likely increase overall cloud cover a bit, through
there could be more in the way of afternoon sunshine across
western sections. High temps will be in the 70s in most places,
but remain on the upper 60s across some far ern sections of
Long Island and CT.

Continued CAA n a N-NE flow will lead to low temps in the 50s
throughout.

&&

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
Key Points:

* Dry into much of Tuesday.

* Possible showers mid to late week with an approaching frontal
  system.

* Temperatures will likely end up slightly below normal starting
  Monday.

Offshore low pressure continues to departure on Sunday as high
pressure centered well to our northeast noses into the area.
Aloft, heights start to rise, especially the second half of
Sunday, as an upper level ridge builds in. This pattern will
lead to dry and mostly sunny conditions Sunday and Monday. With
low pressure heading away from the area, the pressure gradient
will lower and allow winds to gradually decrease. Used the NBM
10th percentile for low temperatures Sunday night across
northern portions of the interior as winds will be lightest and
there will likely be less cloud coverage. Otherwise, followed
the NBM closely for Sunday and Monday.

There is some disagreement for what happens mid to late week
with the approach and passing of a frontal system. Any
unsettled weather from this system will depend on strength of
surface high pressure and evolution of the approaching upper
level trough. Went slightly lower than NBM with PoPs based on
the latest GFS keeping the surface high locked in over the
northeast. Otherwise, stuck close to the NBM. With the
wetter/cloudier solution temperatures will likely be just below
normal much of the week. If guidance starts trending closer to
the latest GFS, a drier/more sun solution may end up with
slightly warmer temperatures.

.AVIATION /00Z SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure will remain south and east of Long Island through
Saturday.

Mainly VFR for most terminals. MVFR or lower possible overnight
for eastern terminals, namely KISP and KGON, possibly KBDR. Low
stratus remains possible late tonight into early Saturday,
otherwise expecting a mainly VFR Saturday with pockets of MVFR,
mainly east.

SHRA have been struggling to approach KGON so expecting dry
conditions overnight but SHRA become possible again tomorrow
morning for KGON.

NE winds 10-15 kt into the overnight diminishing slightly to
7-10 kt and shifting a bit more N/NNE. Winds pick up again from
the NE 10-15 kt with gusts near 20 kt Saturday morning into the
afternoon.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Amendments possible for any potential MVFR ceilings.

OUTLOOK FOR 00Z SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...

Saturday Night: Mainly VFR. MVFR possible early for KGON, KISP.

Sunday: VFR. NE winds G15-20 kt possible, highest east.

Monday: VFR.

Tuesday and Wednesday: Mainly VFR, with pockets of MVFR
possible.

forecasts, can be found at: https:/www.weather.gov/zny/n90<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...
SCA has been extended into daytime Sunday for the ocean waters,
and into daytime Sat for the far ern Sound and
Peconic/Gardiners Bays. Winds there should gust to 25-30 kt,
highest on the ern ocean waters, with ocean seas on the outer
waters building from 6-7 ft to 8-10 ft by daytime Sat.
Ocean seas should subside somewhat Sat night back to 6-7 ft.

With the exception of the far eastern ocean waters, wind gusts
will likely be below 25 kt on Sunday. Ocean seas will however
remain elevated through at least the middle of the week, and
extensions to the current SCA are likely.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
There are no hydrologic issues through the middle of next week.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
Coastal flooding should continue into at least Sunday for much
of the area and possibly into early next week for the south
shore back bays of western LI due to offshore low pressure and
an easterly swell propagating away from it at a time of high
astronomical tides. Surge increases a bit into Saturday. While
astronomical levels will be on a downward trend, the surge will
compensate for the total water level.

Forecast surge varies from near 1 to near 2 ft, highest along
the south shore bays of Long Island and parts of western Long
Island Sound. These areas plus parts of lower NY Harbor should
see the greatest impact.

Minor to moderate coastal flooding is expected through
Saturday. Coastal flood watches for Saturday have been replaced
with advisories for locations adjacent to western LI Sound and
the lower NY Harbor. These locations may see some localized
moderate coastal flooding. A coastal flood warning is in effect
for Southern Queens and Southern Nassau for the Saturday high
tide cycle. The morning and afternoon high tide cycles will
experience the more extensive flooding due it being the higher
of the two high tides. During the nighttime hours, the flooding
will be closer to minor coastal flood benchmarks and may just
be localized.

The high rip current risk through Saturday will likely need to
be extended into Sunday due to a prolonged period of easterly
swells.
