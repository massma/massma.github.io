Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
743 PM PDT Thu Aug 29 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Dry and incrementally warmer over the next several
days. High temperatures will be back in the 80s by the weekend.
Cooler conditions and a chance for more rain due to a passing
weather disturbance are likely by Monday or Tuesday of next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Current satellite showing
clear skies over W WA this evening. Temperatures around the area
still largely in the 70s as of 7 PM PDT. Comparing that to 24 hours
ago, most locations are running on average 5-10 degrees warmer. Of
particular not is along the coast where temps at Hoquiam and
Quillayute remain in the upper 70s...79 and 78 respectively. This
puts them 13 to 14 degrees warmer than they were yesterday, proving
to be significant outliers. As upper level ridging remains in place,
temperatures will continue to rise, although far more incrementally
that the jump between the high temperatures today compared to those
of yesterday.

All that said, inherited forecast remains on track and requires no
additional updates. For additional forecast details, please refer to
the Previous Discussion section below.

From Previous Discussion...Recent satellite imagery shows clear
skies over western Washington, thanks to a building high pressure
system over the region. Temperatures this afternoon will warm into
the upper 70s for most of the interior, and low 80s particularly in
the Cascade foothills and the Southwest Interior.

Afternoon highs will continue to warm especially heading into the
weekend, with high temperatures over the interior warming in the
low to mid 80s. The warmest day of the next several continues to
be Saturday, with highs in the mid to upper 80s, and possibly some
90s in the low mountain valleys and areas south of Olympia. Along
with these warmer temperatures, widespread moderate HeatRisk can
be expected on this day.

Light offshore flow during this period will help these
temperatures climb throughout the weekend. As of right now, there
is no considerable threat of a strong, east wind event setting up.
Warmer temperatures this weekend could dry out recent wet fuels,
especially in the lower cascade valleys. Please refer to the Fire
Weather discussion for more details.

Highs on Sunday will be a touch cooler, in the low 80s for most
of the region as high pressure and the associated upper level
ridge moves eastward.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...From Previous
Discussion...Ensemble guidance continues to highlight a cutoff low
moving along the California and Oregon border through early next
week. The trajectory of this cutoff low looks to be largely moving
onshore through Oregon, which will help the influence over western
Washington become somewhat limited. There is still some uncertainty
for deviations in its intensity and track, but for now, there is
still a chance for some precipitation and possibly some
thunderstorms in the Cascades at this time.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will remain situated over the region
through the TAF period. Northerly winds aloft will become more
westerly tonight into Friday. Satellite shows clear skies across
western WA this evening, making for VFR conditions at all area
terminals. Patchy fog may develop overnight into Friday, most likely
for interior terminals north of KPAE. Could see some brief
visibility reductions for terminals (mainly KBLI) during the early
morning period should fog make it into the terminal. Surface winds
generally persisting out of the N/NE at 7-12 kts with a few gusts to
20 kt this afternoon. Expect winds to ease again overnight, but
increase again by the early afternoon hours on Friday.

KSEA...VFR conditions expected through the TAF period. Surface
winds generally persisting out of the N at 7-12 kt will ease
again overnight. Winds will increase again to 7-12 kt again by 21Z
Friday. 14/18<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...High pressure will persist over the northeastern Pacific
and will interact with thermally induced low pressure along the
Washington coast over the next few days. This will allow for
northerly winds to persist across much of the area waters.
Winds generally look to remain in the 10-20 kt range across the
coastal waters and below Small Craft criteria. Light offshore
flow along the Strait of Juan de Fuca will transition to onshore
again by Sunday as a weak frontal system approaches the area
waters and decays. Onshore flow will then increase across the
region early next week.

Seas generally hovering between 3 to 6 feet over the next few
days. Persistent northerly winds will allow for seas across
portions of the outer waters to build to 7 ft Friday and Saturday
before subsiding again on Sunday. 14

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>From Previous Discussion...High pressure will begin
to develop east of the Cascades on Thursday with a thermal trough
along the coast. This will allow winds to turn light offshore over
the Cascades starting Thursday. This will allow relative humidity
values to drop into the 30s, even as low as 15-20 percent Saturday
and Sunday in the southern parts of the Cascades and mountain
valleys. Relative humidity recovery will be poor overnight, only
reaching around 40-60%. It will also be unstable over the Cascades,
which would meet critical fire weather criteria.

However, area fuels are currently moist from recent rains,
mitigating the impact of the critical fire weather. Under the
conditions for the rest of the week, fuels will dry out quickly and
it`s not out of the question that ERC`s will exceed the 90
percentile once again and bring the possibility of Red Flag
conditions. It will be important to monitor how fast fuels respond.
