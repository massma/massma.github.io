Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
819 AM PST Mon Jan 20 2025

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>As advertised, cold temperatures are being felt this
morning. Widespread 20s are on the thermometer as we gradually
warm up. Some locations have even cooled to the upper teens such
as Bremerton and Arlington. The Cold Weather Advisory has been
allowed to expire but a chilly day is certain to remain. Any
lingering freezing fog will fade as the day progress with sunny
skies expected. The previous discussion remains below along with
an updated marine/aviation section.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...High pressure will dominate the weather into the
middle of this week, bringing dry conditions and cold overnight
temperatures. Lows will fall below freezing over much of Western
Washington at least into mid-week while daytime highs will remain
below normal.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Clear skies over much of W
WA this morning via satellite imagery allowing for some very cold
temperatures to emerge. Lower 20s present over some locations such
as Shelton and Arlington while on the higher end of the range, mid
30s are present in Everett and at Sea-Tac. The majority of remaining
obs falling somewhere in the middle. Given this wide spread of temp
range, it is difficult to get a feel for how current Cold Advisory
is handling the situation. Will leave inherited headline in place
mainly on the grounds that some locations within the advisory area
are seeing dewpoints that, if reached, would bring these sites
within criteria.

Model solutions remain largely unchanged, providing difficulty in
creating original discussion content. The upper level ridge will
begin its slow breakdown today as the ridge axis finally reaches W
WA. Weak trough slides in Tuesday with only increasing clouds to
come with it. Ridging rebuilds into the area for Wednesday.

The aforementioned clouds will help to take the edge off of these
cold overnight temperatures and providing at least a couple degrees
of warming, ranging from the mid 20s to near 30 both tonight and
Tuesday night. Daytime highs may see a degree or two of warming
between today and Tuesday, but not enough to impact the forecast
temperature range of the lower to mid 40s...with Wednesday being
nearly identical to its predecessor.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Discrepancies in the
deterministic models persist when considering Thursday, again all
rooted in the amplitude of the second ridge mentioned in the short
term. ECMWF maintains a lower amplitude, making W WA susceptible to
a weak trough quickly passing through late Thursday and early
Friday. The GFS offers a higher amplitude ridge, keeps the timing
similar to the ECMWF with a trough coming in late Thursday, but
deepens this feature to the point where precip would persist for
much of the day Friday before the system exits Friday night. As has
been the case, the NBM has latched on to this uncertainty and is
trying to play PoPs down the middle...making a case for some precip
while still keeping things out of the likely or categorical range
that the GFS solution would suggest. Taken within the scope of the
ensembles, however, this solution, PoPs of around 40 pct, ends up
being an outlier on the high side of things as the statistical mean
remains more in the 10-20 pct range. As such, while precip cannot be
ruled out, chances do seem lower than what is forecast. Ridging
returns for Saturday and Sunday, and while still over the Pacific
waters, its influence will be enough to bring a return to dry
conditions.

Daytime high temps in the extended do not seem to vary much from the
short term, ranging in the lower to mid 40s for the remainder of the
forecast period. Overnight lows Thursday night will benefit from the
incoming system and its associated clouds, bringing W WA the first
night with lows above freezing in quite some time...but not by
much...ranging in the lower to mid 30s. Falling under the influence
of another ridge will produce lows akin to the short term, falling
once again below freezing and ranging from the mid 20s to around 30
from Friday night through the end of the forecast period.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge over Western Washington will weaken
later this afternoon and tonight as a weak trough moves through
tonight. The ridge will rebuild on Tuesday. Northwest flow aloft
will transition more westerly tonight.

Areas of LIFR cigs and vsbys with FZFG from OLM southward, and in
localized areas of south Puget Sound. Conditions will slowly improve
in these areas to VFR by later this morning into midday. Otherwise
VFR conditions elsewhere with increasing high clouds through today.
Generally light winds through tonight.

KSEA...VFR conditions with increasing high clouds through today.
Lighter east winds this morning will transition more to NE from 4 to
8kts by midday, then becoming light E/SE tonight. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...High pressure will remain over the waters today. A
weak system will move by to the north Tuesday. High pressure will
build back into the waters Tuesday night and remain through
Thursday. A weak system will move through the area Thursday night
into Friday. Possible small craft advisory winds in the coastal
waters Thursday into Friday.
