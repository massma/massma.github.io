Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
401 AM EDT Wed Oct 18 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure builds into the region today and remains in
control through Thursday. A frontal system approaches Thursday
night and impacts the region Friday. A secondary low develops
along the Delmarva Friday night and deepens through Saturday
night while tracking to the northeast. The low departs to the
northeast Sunday as high pressure builds in from the west and
settles over the region early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure will gradually build into the region today,
with a mostly dry day expected. Aloft, an upper level low will be
slow to exit. A handful of the overnight CAMs are showing the
potential for some afternoon light showers or sprinkles as the
low departs. Otherwise, expect another day of sun and clouds
with temperatures in the low to mid 60s.

Clearing skies tonight and light winds will allow overnight lows to
fall into the 40s for much of the region. The NYC metro area will
remain in the lower 50s. A a combination of MAV/MET and NBM were
used in the near term.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Thursday starts off with surface high pressure and weak ridging
aloft over the region. Expect a mostly sunny day. Winds will remain
relatively light to start, then become a bit more southerly as the
high starts to move east of the area during the afternoon. Highs on
Thursday will be in the middle and upper 60s, potentially
approaching 70s in the NYC/NJ metro area.

The surface high and upper level ridge shifts further east Thursday
night, allowing an upper level trough to approach from the west.
Some of the forecast guidance has a weak low developing Thursday
night off the Mid-Atlantic coast and starting to work its way
northward. Forecast guidance showing some of the lows associated
precipitation moving into the region Thursday night. There are
some model differences with the timing and placement of this
potential low development. It is possible that Thursday night
will remain dry, however will continue to maintain some slight
chance POPs mainly after 06z. With cloud cover increasing and a
southerly flow in place, lows will be in the 50s Thursday night.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system impacts the area Friday into Friday night. With
marginal instability and CAPE developing over the ocean and into the
eastern portions of the forecast area Friday night, with warm air
advecting northward with increasing isentropic lift there is the
chance of isolated thunder.

There remains differences with the timing and evolution of the
development of a secondary low off the coast in the vicinity of the
Delmarva Friday night into Saturday, however, confidence remains
that precipitation will be occurring with the development of this
low. And with additional marginal instability and CAPE during
Saturday, and with the low level low moving over the region, there
will again be a chance for isolated thunder mainly Saturday
afternoon.

With a strong pressure gradient increasing with the deepening low,
and cold advection setting up behind the departing low, a strong and
gusty west to northwest flow will be developing. The coldest air of
the autumn season will be moving into the region Sunday night.
Temperatures will be bear normal Friday and Saturday and below
normal, as much as 5 to 10 degrees, Sunday into the beginning of
next week. With clearing skies and winds becoming light both Monday
night and Tuesday night there is the potential for frost in the
outlying locations.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>With high pressure in control, expect conditions to remain below
Small Craft Advisory Criteria through Thursday night.

With a persistent period of southeast flow Friday into Friday night,
ahead of an approaching frontal system, ocean seas may build to SCA
levels by late Friday night into Saturday morning, and build through
Saturday. As a secondary low develops along the Delmarva late
Friday, and deepens into Saturday night while tracking north, small
craft conditions are expected to develop on all the forecast waters
Saturday night and then continue into at least Sunday night, and
possibly into Monday as winds and seas gradually diminish. Small
craft conditions likely remain on the ocean waters into Monday
evening. The highest wind gusts on the ocean waters are expected
late Saturday night into Sunday evening with the potential for a
period of gales Sunday into Sunday night.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
