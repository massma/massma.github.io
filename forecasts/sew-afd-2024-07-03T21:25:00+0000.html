Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
225 PM PDT Wed Jul 3 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Dry conditions and warming temperatures are expected
through Sunday. Hot conditions are expected Friday through at
least Monday across much of the region. These conditions will also
result in elevated fire weather concerns through the weekend into
early next week. While slight cooling is expected next week,
temperatures will remain well above normal throughout most of the
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Pleasant conditions are
solidly in place across western Washington this afternoon.
Temperatures as of 2pm were generally in the 60s to low 70s under
mostly clear skies. A ridge of high pressure will continue to
shift east across the eastern Pacific through Friday before
stalling along the west coast and amplifying this weekend. This
will result in a steady warming trend from pleasant conditions
today to hot conditions by Friday into the weekend.

For the Independence Day holiday, expect temperatures in the
upper 70s to mid-80s across the lowland locations away from the
coast. Winds will be out of the north at 10-15 mph, highest along
the coast and through the Puget Sound.

By Friday, daytime highs will rise well into the 80s or even low
90s across the interior. This will result in widespread HeatRisk
levels reaching moderate/orange across the region. Several more
degrees of warming are expected Saturday as the ridge strengthens
allowing HeatRisk levels to reach major/red in favored areas such
as urban heat islands and the eastern slopes of the Cascades and
Olympics. While areas along the immediate coast of Washington may
see temperatures peak on Saturday, most areas will likely see
temperatures peak on Sunday. On Sunday expect widespread high
temperatures in the upper 80s and 90s area-wide. Highs around 100
degrees cannot be ruled out across the southwestern portions of
the CWA. A Heat Advisory was issued this morning, beginning at
noon on Friday and extending through the weekend for all areas.
The Heat Advisory will continue through Monday for areas away from
the Washington Coast.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Weak onshore flow will
result in a slight decrease in temperatures Monday, though
widespread temperatures in the upper 80s to low 90s are still
expected. This will be the beginning of a very slow ramp down in
temperatures next week. Even though temperatures will be on a
downward trend, they will still be several degrees above normal
throughout the week. It is possible that the Heat Advisory
currently in effect may need to be extended beyond Monday for
some areas. At this time there is no signal for precipitation
through the next 7-10 days and as such fire weather concerns will
continue to escalate for the foreseeable future. See the fire
weather section for additional details.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure and offshore flow will lead to dry and
stable weather conditions through Thursday. The coast may see a
little morning stratus on Thursday but otherwise clear and VFR in
the interior. 33

KSEA...Clear with north winds through the period. Winds will
increase to 10-15 kt Thursday from 21-03z. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The flow will turn offshore tonight and Thursday while a
thermal trough forms along the coast. Winds are generally light
over the waters. Offshore flow will prevail over the weekend with
the winds flipping back to onshore Sunday night and Monday. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Benign fire weather conditions are expected to
remain through Thursday. However, confidence is high on an
amplifying upper-level ridge settling over the region beginning
Friday. Not only will dry conditions persist, but hot weather is
in the forecast. The heat is expected to peak over the weekend
with the hottest temperatures likely on Sunday. Critical RH values
are trending widespread over the Cascades with isolated areas
within the Olympic Mountain valleys during this time. The hot and
dry setting will be enough to maintain elevated fire weather
conditions especially with fuels expected to dry out rapidly
during this heat stretch. The next notable push of onshore flow
will arrive Sunday night into Monday. It`ll bring decent RH
recoveries to fire zones such as 650 but won`t be strong to
completely limit the threat for the Cascades early next week.
