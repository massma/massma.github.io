Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
258 PM PDT Tue May 13 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Troughing across the interior West will result in
continued onshore flow into Wednesday for clouds and shower
chances. Another trough Thursday will result in additional light
precipitation. The unsettled weather pattern continues over the
weekend as additional troughing settles across the Pacific
Northwest.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Widespread stratus
this afternoon with onshore flow as west- northwest flow aloft
continues due to troughing located across Western US. Generally
dry weather this afternoon with temperatures in the mid 50s to low
60s. Increasing onshore flow tonight into Wednesday will result
in additional shower development, particularly over the Cascades.
A weak convergence zone may develop tonight around central Puget
Sound as well. Overall, QPF amounts will remain light into
Wednesday.

A brief period of dry weather Wednesday evening into Wednesday
night as ridging offshore nudges into Western Washington.
Precipitation chances increase again Thursday into Thursday
night as reinforced troughing settles over the Pacific
Northwest. Temperatures will be a few degrees cooler Wednesday
and Thursday with highs mid 50s to low 60s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An unsettled weather
pattern looks to continue over the weekend as deeper troughing
develops across the Pacific Northwest. Ensembles are in good
agreement regarding this troughing, with some minor uncertainty in
the depth of the trough. Precipitation chances continue during
this period, peaking Friday night through Saturday. Some
uncertainty exists in the upper level pattern early next week, but
generally zonal flow is expected to continue, resulting in chance
POPs for most areas as shown in the NBM. Temperatures over the
weekend into next week will remain below normal, with highs
ranging in the mid 50s to mid 60s. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite shows some of cloud cover beginning to
lift and scatter behind a trough that past through earlier
(especially towards the north). Overcast ceilings will become more
broken this afternoon, and most areas (except along the Pacific
Coast) will see MVFR ceilings improve to VFR around or just after
21Z (from north to south). The flow aloft will turn more
northwesterly this afternoon ahead of another front driving a cold
front tonight/tomorrow morning with scattered showers across the
terminals. Widespread MVFR ceilings are expected tonight with the
front (as early as 08-10Z) - will likely remain MVFR for most
terminals until at least 20-22Z.

Winds this afternoon remain out of the southwest 5 to 10 kt (few
gusts this afternoon near the waters, and variable northerly winds
north of Seattle with diffluence with a push from the Strait of Juan
de Fuca). Winds will pick up in the South Interior from the west
on early Wednesday.

KSEA...Ceilings will improve to VFR by mid to late afternoon
(scattering taking place to the north). Winds will remain
southwesterly at 5 to 10 kt. MVFR ceilings will redevelop from
roughly 10Z and may last beyond 20-22Z Wednesday. Post-frontal
convergence zone Wednesday afternoon may be strong enough to turn
winds northerly after 00Z Thursday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Higher pressure in the outer waters (with lower pressure
inland) will continue the pattern of onshore flow (with westerly
pushes through at least Wednesday evening). Seas this afternoon
continue to remain 8-10 feet in the coastal with periods around 9
seconds with the small craft advisory in place. Gusty winds
continue in the outer coastal waters with winds of 15 to 25 kt
(will decrease going into Wednesday). A push through the Strait
of Juan de Fuca will bring 20-30 kt westerlies through (another
round is expected behind a cold front Wednesday afternoon into
Thursday).

The next chance of hazardous gusty winds will come with a system
Sunday in the outer coastal waters. Otherwise seas will drop to 5
to 6 feet Thursday, and increase to 6 to 8 feet Friday through the
weekend then dropping back to 5 to 6 feet early next week.
