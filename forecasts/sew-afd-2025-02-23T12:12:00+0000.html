Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
412 AM PST Sun Feb 23 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An atmospheric river pattern will maintain wet
conditions across western Washington into early next week, with
periods of moderate to heavy rain and breezy winds. Conditions are
favored to dry out towards mid-week as high pressure develops,
with potential for more widespread precipitation next weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An initial wave of
precipitation from an atmospheric river will continue to shift
inland this morning as a front crosses the Pacific Northwest,
with 24 hour rainfall totals reaching 3 to 4 inches over parts of
the southern Olympics and central Cascades. Much of the lowlands
will dry out by the mid morning, seeing brief relief from wet
conditions into the early afternoon with showers favored to linger
over the Cascades. Snow levels as high as 6000 ft over the
mountains has allowed for sharp rises to area rivers, with another
injection of precipitation later today keeping river flows high
through the weekend.

The next round of moderate to heavy precipitation will spread
across western Washington this afternoon as another frontal
system lifts across the region. Breezy southerly winds will pick
up as the front moves through with gusts reaching 30 to 45 mph. A
few lightning strikes also cannot be ruled out in stronger showers
that develop. Conditions will dry out for most areas by the late
evening, with showers favored to linger over the mountains
overnight. The lowlands will see up to half an inch of additional
rainfall through the remainder of the weekend, with 1 to 2 inches
of rain over the mountains. Temperatures will stay on the mild
side, with highs today in the low to mid 50s.

After a brief break Monday morning, a deepening low offshore will
spread another round of moderate to heavy precipitation and gusty
winds across western Washington Monday afternoon to Tuesday. The
low will intensify as it approaches the Pacific Northwest coast on
Monday before stalling and weakening as it moves onshore. While
forecast models still show some variability over the exact track
of the low, confidence is high that strong winds will develop and
a High Wind Watch has been issued for areas along the Pacific
Coast. The convective nature of this system will also allow for
heavy showers to develop, with enough instability for isolated
thunderstorms Monday afternoon. This system will bring an
additional 1 to 3 inches of liquid for most areas between Monday
and Tuesday and up to 4 to 5 inches for higher terrain over the
Olympics and Cascades. With snow levels lowering to 3500-4000 ft,
the mountains will see accumulating snowfall over higher
elevations through Tuesday with several inches on track for the
higher Cascade Passes.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Forecast models continue
to favor a ridge building over the western US towards the second
half of the week, allowing for drier conditions. Temperatures will
stay on the mild side through Friday with highs in the 50s to
near 60 degrees across the lowlands. Chances for precipitation
increase by next weekend as ensembles highlight the return of
troughing over the Pacific Northwest.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Current radar imagery shows much of the rain has moved
to the east of the terminals. Expect rain to continue until Sunday
evening/night, as another round of precipitation is expected to push
trough the morning hours of Sunday. Currently a mix of MVFR and low
end VFR ceilings across the terminals. Expecting MVFR to persist
through the remainder of the TAF period. IFR/LIFR conditions are
also possible with the heavier bands of precipitation.

South to southwesterly winds are expected to persist with speeds of
5-10 kt. Winds will pick up Sunday afternoon and gust between 20-25
kt. The strongest winds will be along the coastal terminals.
Probabilities show a 50-80% chance of exceeding 35 kt wind gusts
along the coast (KHQM).

KSEA...Radar showing a brief break in precipitation at the moment.
MVFR conditions are expected to persist through the majority of the
TAF period as rain is expected to remain in the forecast until
Sunday evening. Guidance also hints at periods of IFR during the
moderate/heavy rain (30-40% chance). Brief improvement expected
Sunday night into early Monday morning with precipitation tapering
off. A stronger system is expected to impact the terminal on Monday.
High-resolution guidance shows precipitation moving in on Monday
morning towards the end of the TAF period. However, there is some
uncertainty regarding the timing of the precipitation among the
models. Regardless, current models show that precipitation may
arrive between 16Z-18Z Monday.

Winds will be south/southwesterly 4-6 kt. Gusty winds are expected
at the terminal Sunday afternoon into early Monday morning, with
gusts of 20-30 kt likely. High-resolution guidance hints that gusts
may exceed 30 kt (50-70% chance).

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Unsettled marine conditions are expected to persist into
Monday and early Tuesday morning. Winds will increase Sunday
afternoon into Sunday night into small craft criteria. A stronger
low pressure system will move across the waters Monday night into
Tuesday. High-end gale force winds with gusts approaching storm
force are possible along the central and south coastal waters, and a
Storm Watch has been issued. Winds will also increase in the
interior waters and may approach gale force criteria, prompting a
Gale Watch to be issued. Winds will begin to decrease on Tuesday
morning and more benign conditions will ensue across the waters as
high pressure develops Tuesday night. Models have high pressure
persisting through late in the week.

Combined seas of 8-11 ft on Sunday, and will build rapidly on Monday
night into early Tuesday morning. Waves in the coastal waters will
build to 20-30 ft, with the largest waves localized to the southern
coastal waters. Waves will begin to subside throughout the day on
Tuesday in Wednesday, but will remain between 10-12 ft through late
in the week.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Rainfall amounts over the last 24 hours across the
western and southern slopes of the Olympics have ranged from 2 to 4
inches, with 1 to 4 inches recorded across the Cascades. These
amounts, combined with snow levels ranging 6000 to 8000 feet has led
to rises on area rivers across Western Washington. The Skokomish
River in Mason County continues to rise and the river is expected to
crest in Moderate flood stage today. Additional rises are being
monitored this morning as well, especially for the Tolt and
Snoqualmie Rivers, as well as the Stillaguamish River basin.
Furthermore, additional precipitation is expected at times through
Monday night, allowing for periods of additional rises on area
rivers. For that reason, the Flood Watch continues over the next few
days for most of Western Washington due to the continued threat of
river flooding. A hydrologic outlook also remains for Jefferson,
Clallam, and Whatcom Counties for a lower chance of flooding.
