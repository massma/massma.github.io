Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
144 PM EDT Mon Sep 30 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
Low pressure passes to the south as it tracks along a stalled
boundary over the Mid Atlantic through Tuesday. A cold front
then approaches from the west Wednesday, moving through
Wednesday night. High pressure reestablishes itself over the
area for Thursday and Friday. A cold front could potentially
move through sometime Saturday, with high pressure building in
behind it to close out the weekend.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
Another update sent to account for lower cloud cover this
afternoon than previously anticipated. The rest of the forecast
is otherwise on track.

A filling upper low tracks east into the Mid Atlantic today as
an amplified upper ridge axis remains over the Northeast.
Locally, drier air works in from the north as surface high
pressure continues to nose down into the area. This will allow
drier conditions across the region than over the weekend. A
stationary front that has been draped across North Carolina will
push farther south as the high builds in, allowing more more
sunshine than recent days. Primarily mostly sunny/partly sunny
conditions across the area. Temperatures nudge upwards from
recent days, with daytime highs topping out in the low 70s for
most.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
October opens on a relatively quiet note, offering seasonal
temperatures and dry conditions. The upper low drifting east
over the Mid Atlantic opens into a trough as it slides east and
offshore. Meanwhile, strong ridging remains over the Northeast,
with the region in between. Surface low pressure develops off
the Carolinas and Mid Atlantic coast late Tuesday into Tuesday
night. Guidance continues to keep the bulk of any associated
precip to the south of the region, but still can`t entirely rule
out a few spotty showers Tuesday evening, especially near the
coast.

Weak high pressure briefly builds in behind the exiting offshore low
Wednesday as a trough digs over the Upper Great Lakes. This will
send a cold front toward the region, passing through by Wednesday
evening. Best forcing appears well to the north, and moisture will
be limited, so not anticipating much in the way of impacts from the
fropa, perhaps a few showers ahead of the boundary Wed evening
across the northern interior. More likely, the front moves through
dry, with clearing skies behind it Wednesday night.

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
High pressure looks to reestablish itself over the area on Thursday
and Friday after the cold frontal passage late Wednesday. Aloft,
heights rise ahead of an approaching broad upper level trough. With
S/SW flow through the column, we will see a warming trend through
Friday as well as increasing moisture. Highs both days will be in
the mid to upper 70s.

As the aforementioned upper level trough approaches, an associated
surface low likely forms and passes to our north. This would drag a
cold front through the area sometime on Saturday and result in some
showers. There are differences among the guidance with the strength
of the surface low/front, but given where the upper level trough
will likely be, the greatest lift would be to our north and we would
likely only see light showers here.

High pressure builds in behind the cold frontal passage, with a
cooler and drier airmass moving in. Dewpoints drop to the 40s and
high temperatures will be in the upper 60s to low 70s.

.AVIATION /18Z MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure remains over the area through Tuesday afternoon.

VFR through this evening, then after 04Z ceilings are expected
to lower to MVFR from the east to the west, becoming MVFR at the
NYC terminals around 10Z. Improvement to VFR at the NYC metro
terminals is likely by 16Z while the other terminals remain
MVFR. There are some timing uncertainties with the onset of MVFR
and then improvement to VFR. There is also a chance of brief
IFR at KGON, and KISP.

An E flow will continue through the TAF period. Winds along the
Connecticut coast and at KJFK may become SE this afternoon.

 NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Winds at KJFK may briefly become SE, 130/140, before going back
to an east flow.

Lowering of cigs to MVFR tonight into Tuesday morning may be
off a few hours.

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

Tuesday afternoon: VFR at the NYC metro terminals, and MVFR
becoming VFR at the other terminals.

Tuesday night through Wednesday: MVFR possible in slight chance
of showers.

Thursday through Friday: Mainly VFR.

Saturday: Mainly VFR. A slight chance of showers.

.MARINE...
Sub-SCA conditions are expected across all local waters through
tonight. Passing low pressure to the south will help build seas
above 5 ft on the ocean Tuesday, likely persisting through
Wednesday.

Seas are forecast to lower below 5 ft by Wednesday night, and
sub SCA conditions are then largely expected on all coastal
waters thereafter. However, a gusty northwest flow could follow
a potential cold frontal passage on Saturday and wind gusts
could briefly reach 25 knots.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
There are no hydrologic concerns through this weekend.
