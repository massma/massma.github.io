Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
431 PM PST Mon Mar 3 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak weather system will move through the region
Tuesday resulting in widespread rain, mountain snow, and breezy
winds. Drying is expected through the day Wednesday with dry
conditions by Thursday. A more active weather pattern may bring
lowland rain, mountain snow, and breezy to windy conditions by the
weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Pockets of light
rain/drizzle continue to become more isolated this afternoon.
Mostly cloudy skies with an occasional sunbreak through the
remainder of the day. The next frontal system will roll through
western Washington from southwest to northeast on Tuesday. This will
be a relatively quick-hitting system with beneficial precipitation
totals. Instability along and behind the front Tuesday
afternoon/evening could lead to convective cells with isolated
lightning or even small hail - most likely along the Pacific Coast.
Breezy winds will also accompany this system, but chances for any
gusts over 45 mph will remain over the water.

A few post-frontal showers may persist into Wednesday, but there
will be an overall drying trend. Thursday is expected to be dry area-
wide thanks to transient ridging over the region.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Considerable uncertainty
develops Friday through the weekend. In general, troughing is
favored. However, digging deeper into cluster analysis there are
about 10-20% of the solutions that point towards split flow which
would keep the area drier that the remainder of the solution space.
The most likely outcome is weak atmospheric river conditions
directed at Vancouver Island and having a glancing blow to
northwest WA (mainly the Olympic Peninsula and the far north
Cascades). Given this somewhat wetter scenario, QPF totals would
bring a threat of flooding back to the Skokomish River, with a
little to no threat elsewhere. The other hazard to watch will be
wind with a 40-60% chance of gusts > 45mph along the Pacific Coast
and the northern interior waters, peaking on Saturday.

Looking towards the week-2 time frame, below normal temperatures and
above normal precipitation are favored signaling a continuation
of an active weather pattern well into March.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>MVFR conditions across the terminals and expected to
persist for the majority of the TAF period. A frontal system will
bring rain to the terminals Tuesday morning into the afternoon.
There is a chance for lightning Tuesday afternoon/evening (10-25%),
with the highest chances along the coast. Winds will pick up Tuesday
morning, with speeds generally around 10-15 kt and gusting to 20-25
kt (highest speeds along coast and northern interior), and will be
southerly/southwesterly. Winds will gradually decrease into the late
evening/night.

KSEA...Currently VFR conditions; however expecting MVFR
conditions to be the favorable trend and expect it to persist
into the majority of Tuesday. High-resolution guidance shows rain
is expected to impact the terminal Tuesday morning and subside
later in the evening. There is a small chance for convection
Tuesday afternoon (5-10%). Southerly/southwesterly winds will
increase late Tuesday morning into the afternoon hours. Winds will
be around 10-13 kt, gusting to 20-25 kt. Gusts exceeding 25 kt
are possible, with guidance hinting at a 30-50% chance.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will break down tonight, with a frontal
system expected to move over the waters on Tuesday morning. This
system will bring gusty winds falling under small craft criteria
along the coastal waters, west and east entrances of the Strait, and
northern interior waters. Lower-end gale gusts are possible along
the outer coastal waters. Winds will gradually subside Tuesday
night/early Wednesday morning below small craft criteria. Weak high
pressure will rebuild offshore late Wednesday night into Thursday.
The next frontal system looks to approach on Friday, potentially
bringing another round of small craft winds into the weekend.

Seas 5-7 ft building to 8-13 ft by Tuesday evening. Waves will
decrease slightly on Wednesday morning, before increasing back again
Wednesday evening/night to 9-11 ft. Another decrease in seas
Thursday morning, with waves decreasing below 10 ft. Friday evening
into the weekend, seas build to 10-13 ft.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No river flooding through Friday. Potential wet
system next weekend could push the Skokomish River above action or
flood stage by the weekend. There has been a lot of variability in
the rainfall forecast for the weekend. This situation will be
monitored closely through the week and could certainly change in the
next few days. The threat for river flooding on other rivers appears
minimal at this time.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
