Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
217 AM PST Sun Jan 26 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge centered offshore will gradually
build into the region through the early portion of the week. This
will lead to dry conditions and chilly overnight temperatures.
The ridge will weaken by midweek and a series of systems will
bring a return of lowland rain and mountain snow Friday into the
weekend, with a threat of lowland snow late in the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Strong high pressure over
the Pac NW keeps western WA dry and stable through early this
week. There`s little to no variation in the forecast - lows in the
20s and 30s, highs in the 40s, clear skies (plenty of sun). 33

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...The ridge is overhead
Wednesday and Thursday and the air mass will be a little warmer
with highs in the mid/upper 40s to around 50. Overnight lows will
still be chilly and below freezing in most spots. The ridge will
exit east Thursday night into Friday and a frontal system will
bring rain and mountain snow back to the region. Onshore flow will
keep lowland temperatures above freezing. A trough will bring
additional showers on Saturday with more snow in the mountains and
passes. Snow levels drop to around 500-1000 ft Saturday night with
a rain/snow mix possible in the lowlands. NBM probabilities show
around 15-20 percent chance of seeing greater than 1 inch in the
interior with around a 30 percent chance Everett north and the
coast. Cool conditions with additional threats of lowland snow are
possible into early next week. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>North-northeasterly flow aloft becoming more
northeasterly throughout the day due to the interplay between a
Pacific upper level ridge attempting to move inland north of an
upper level low over central California. Surface winds largely light
and variable over most terminals, however there are some exceptions.
SEA and PWT reporting NE winds ranging 4-8 kts and CLM is seeing
influence from the Strait, with southwesterly winds, again ranging 4-
8 kts. Most sites will become northeasterly by late morning/early
afternoon, but speeds should remain similar to current ranges.

VFR conditions area-wide and that should remain the case for the
entire TAF period. OLM will likely prove an exception, with freezing
fog and diminished visibilities there developing between 10-12Z.
They will recover to VFR by late morning.

KSEA...VFR conditions in place for entire TAF period. Northeast
winds 4-8 kts, turning more northerly around 18Z before returning to
northeasterly Sunday evening.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface ridging strengthens over interior British
Columbia and east of the Cascades while a broad surface trough
deepens well to the south over California. As this pattern is not
expected to change for the first half of the week, northerly or weak
onshore flow is expected to persist. The next front will approach
the coastal waters around the middle to later half of next week.

Seas 4 to 6 ft today before diminishing slightly Monday down to 3 to
5 ft and remaining in this range at least through midweek. Wave
heights rebound back to 4 to 6 ft around Thursday with arrival of
the aforementioned front.
