Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
315 PM PST Tue Feb 4 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low spinning off the Pacific
coast will continue to bring chances of snow showers to western
Washington for much of the week before pushing inland on Friday.
This will keep temperatures cold as well as allowing gusty Fraser
outflow winds to drag wind chills into the single digits for
northern portions of the area at least into Thursday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Radar has largely calmed from
this morning, with only two areas worth monitoring. The first being
a band of precip moving northward in Grays Harbor county and another
nearly stationary band in and around Port Angeles...likely due to
upward forcing by terrain of persistent Fraser outflow winds. For
the former, it is traveling in areas that should be seeing temps
north of freezing, and as such is either a mix of rain and snow or
if it is all snow, nothing at this point is likely to stick. The
latter merits watching mainly for its persistence...even though the
echo is not terribly strong. Additionally, temps there only cracked
above 32 as of 1 PM PST and any further warming is going to be
inhibited by the cloud deck present there. Will continue to monitor,
as an additional headline may be warranted there.

W WA is looking at a relatively quiet period this afternoon and
tonight. However, the upper level low responsible for this wintery
weather will shift eastward and as such putting the area back in
line with moisture associated with the feature. This will allow for
the resumption of the prospects for lowland snow. Even though PoPs
will increase throughout the day Wednesday, the main timeframe of
concern will be as early as Wednesday afternoon but likely holding
off until Wednesday evening and into Thursday. On the bright side,
this will bring clouds into the area and thus warming overnight
lows, however said lows will still have a difficult time getting to
30 or higher. With that being the case, any precip from this
incoming moisture will fall as snow. The forecast problem of the day
remains snowfall amounts during this time period and what, if any,
headlines need to be in play. Unfortunately, the multitude of
ensemble members all have different locations that lean toward
greater snowfall amounts. Zooming out and taking these solutions as
a whole, the entire area running from Everett through to Olympia
could see significant snowfall amounts. However, such a broad area
conveys a high level of uncertainty...which is to be expected for
the showery activity expected. Complicating matters will be
temperatures...how quickly or slowly temps fall below 32...and the
prospects for banding. These factors alone create sufficient
uncertainty to postpone any headline issuance for the afternoon
package, in the hopes that a clearer solution presents itself in
future model runs. That said, afternoon forecast will still indicate
that most locations should prepare for amounts ranging from a half
to one inch throughout the overnight period Wednesday before
tapering off Thursday morning. As one might expect, this will likely
result in at least some impact on the Thursday morning commute.

With the upper low sinking southward through the day Thursday,
taking much of its moisture with it, clearing skies are expected
which will only facilitate significant cooling Thursday night,
bringing overnight lows down into the lower to mid 20s. Friday sees
the upper level low finally shifting inland, however the track it
will take will make a huge difference as to whether or not the area
will see precip to go with it. Most solutions take this feature to
the south of the area...keeping PoPs low.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Long term models continue to
show a shortwave disturbance in the flow aloft approaching the area
Saturday, nudging PoPs upward to low-end chance /approx 30-ish pct/.
Once this feature passes, solutions still lean toward W WA remaining
in a troughy pattern for the remainder of the weekend. This would
keep temperatures pretty similar to those of the short term and, as
such, would keep the risk of lowland snow in the forecast. Now, that
being said, solutions still keep any moisture in the area fairly
showery, so as to not only keep PoPs fairly low, but any snowfall
amounts during this time frame pretty limited for the most part. For
the start of the next work week, solutions remain diverse as to
whether or not a strong ridge over the Pacific will shift eastward
into the area. As such, while PoPs remain low...they never go away
either. As the positioning of the ridge will also factor into temp
forecasts, some solutions showing continued cold while other suggest
a warm-up...this uncertainty lends itself well to persistence
forecasting, keeping temps largely unchanged for the remainder of
the forecast period...until a stronger signal in one direction or
the other emerges.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft as low level flow turns
northerly with an upper level low churning offshore. Mostly VFR with
isolated areas of MVFR/IFR in lingering snow showers this afternoon
over the Olympic Peninsula. Conditions will mostly dry out this
evening ahead of another weak influx of moisture overnight,
resulting in scattered snow showers moving northward Wednesday
morning causing brief MVFR/IFR conditions. A stronger wave of
moisture will move northward across western Washington Wednesday
afternoon and evening, bringing continued snow to the region with
additional periods of MVFR to localized IFR in snow and fog. Surface
winds generally N to E through the period 5 to 10 kt.

KSEA...VFR conditions favored through the evening today with
potential for MVFR conditions in light snow showers streaming
northward early Wednesday. Showers Wednesday afternoon may contain a
rain/snow mix initially before changing to all snow after 3z Thurs.
Surface winds generally northeasterly around 6 to 10 knots shifting
more easterly overnight. A brief switch to light southerly winds
early Wednesday morning (12z-17z) before switching back to E/NE 6 to
10 kt Wednesday afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface trough will continue to remain over the
coastal waters with surface ridging in place over British Columbia.
Fraser River outflow winds will continue through Wednesday morning,
where a Small Craft Advisory remains for the Northern Inland waters,
the Central/West Strait of Juan De Fuca, and the adjacent inner
coastal waters. Light offshore flow will persist through the end of
the week, with low pressure offshore and higher pressure inland.

Combined seas generally around 3 to 6 feet will continue throughout
the rest of the week.
