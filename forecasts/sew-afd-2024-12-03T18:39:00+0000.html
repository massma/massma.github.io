.PREV DISCUSSION... <span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>/issued 305 AM PST Tue Dec 3 2024/

.SYNOPSIS...High pressure aloft will allow for continued dry
conditions with morning fog and low stratus. The upper ridge will
break down towards the end of the week as the next storm system
approaches, bringing in the next chance for widespread
precipitation across the region late this week and through the
weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure aloft will
remain firmly in place through Wednesday, maintaining dry and
stable conditions with rounds of morning fog and low stratus.
Upper level clouds along the periphery of the ridge are limiting
the extent of dense fog early this morning, though surface
observations show pockets of greatly reduced visibility. Cold
overnight lows will also give way to the development of freezing
fog in areas that fall below freezing this morning, primarily
south of the Puget Sound. The forecast will continue to see little
change day to day, with highs in the upper 40s to lower 50s and
lows near freezing across the lowlands.

A pattern change is on track for Thursday and beyond, with more
active weather settling back into the region. An upper level
trough will override the high pressure ridge on Thursday, bringing
in a quick shot of rainfall to western Washington. This system
will increase mixing that will help to erode the ridge and scour
out the lower level air mass that has brought fog each morning.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...A warm front will lift
across the region on Friday, bringing in widespread rainfall with
snow levels near 7000-9000 ft. Temperatures Friday will peak well
into the 50s across the lowlands. A cold front will follow closely
behind on Saturday as an upper level trough settles over the
region, bringing in more precipitation and lowering snow levels to
3000-3500 ft by Saturday night. Forecast models shift a cutoff
low inland on Sunday, with a majority of continued shower activity
occurring over the northern Cascades. A ridge is on track to
develop inland towards the beginning of next week, drying things
out as northerly flow aloft keeps cooler temperatures in place.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Widespread IFR/LIFR conditions across several of the
terminals. Some of the terminals have shown some improvement (KBLI
and KCLM) with VFR and MVFR. With the sun out, there should be some
improvement in visibility and the fog should begin to lift around
21Z for most locations still under the fog. Any improvement that
does occur will be short lived as after the sun sets conditions will
deteriorate and conditions at the terminals will once again climb
down as early as 1Z. Expect conditions to worse into Wednesday`s
morning hours, with IFR/LIFR conditions expected once again, with
visibilities decreasing to less than a mile for some terminals.
Similarly to today, the fog seems it may begin to lift around 21Z.

KSEA...Currently under LIFR conditions with northerly/northeasterly
flow with the fog. Recent observations show winds falling within 5-7
kts, slightly higher than guidance. Based on these observations,
winds have been adjusted in the short term to reflect these
observations. At this time, fog is may begin to lift as early as 21Z
into VFR, although confidence is low on the timing. Improved
conditions will only be temporary as fog is expected to settle back
into the terminals shortly after 1Z and LIFR conditions will be
established again into Tuesday night/Wednesday morning. Model
guidance was the fog starting lift again around 21Z (20% chance)on
Wednesday morning.

.HYDROLOGY...An upper ridge will remain in place across Western
Washington through Wednesday. A frontal system will move through
on Thursday for lighter QPF amounts. Another weather system Friday
into Saturday is forecast to bring heavier QPF amounts. In
addition, snow levels are expected to rise later Friday into early
Saturday to 7000 to 9000 feet. This, combined with rainfall, will
result in rises on rivers across Western Washington. At this
time, the Skokomish River is the main river of concern for
potential river flooding during this period. However, other area
rivers will need to be monitored due to the higher snow levels
Friday into Saturday.
