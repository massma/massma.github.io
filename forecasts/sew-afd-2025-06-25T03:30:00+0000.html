Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
830 PM PDT Tue Jun 24 2025

.SYNOPSIS...A series of weak systems passing mainly to the
north Wednesday through Friday will bring a cloudier and cooler
pattern through the remainder of the work week. A return of
higher pressure this weekend will bring sunnier and warmer
conditions into the first part of next week.

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showers are beginning to move inland ahead of tonight`s
front. The rain is not reaching the ground in most places, though
heavier showers will move inland next couple hours along the
coast. Otherwise high clouds have filled in regionwide, and there
are no updates to the forecast below (except for the aviation
section).

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...Warm temperatures
this afternoon despite the abundant high clouds will extend into a
mild evening. As advertised the large scale pattern leaves Western
Washington on the edge of a series of weak upper level systems
passing mainly to the north through Friday. The first will move by
to the north late tonight into Wednesday with  increased low level
onshore flow and mostly cloudy to cloudy skies by morning and a
slight chance of showers for most of the area Wednesday. Highs will
trend cooler with most locations remaining in the 60s. The second in
the series will brush the area Thursday, perhaps resulting in a
little more widespread potential for light showers and continued
cooler high temperatures.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The third weak feature
expected to brush the area Friday keeping a chance of showers in the
forecast and highs in the 60s. The pattern will begin to shift with
upper level ridging beginning to build into Washington Saturday,
helping weaken low level onshore flow and setting up a  warming
trend into early next week. High temps will return to the mid 60s to
mid 70 Saturday then 70s and lower 80s over much of the interior
Sunday. Monday looks to be the warmest day with the upper level
ridge starting to drift east with interior temperatures continue to
warm with highs in the mid 70s to mid 80s and highs near 70 along
the coast.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Variable high clouds across the region ahead of an
approaching disturbance. Increasing clouds this evening as this
front approaches, with IFR ceilings banked up along the coastal
terminals areas. Expect low MVFR ceilings to spread into the
interior after 10z Wednesday with around a 25% chance of IFR
conditions. Breezy west winds through the Strait from KCLM extending
toward KBVS/KPAE. Puget Sound terminals back to southwesterly
surface winds and increase overnight through Wednesday morning.
Gradual return to higher MVFR with a few rain showers on Wednesday.

KSEA...VFR conditions with high cirrus cloud deck. Surface winds
light westerly this evening, backing to southwest later tonight.
Expect low MVFR ceilings to arrive along with breezier southerly
winds around 10z. While low MVFR ceilings remain most likely,
there`s around a 25% chance for a few hours of IFR ceilings. Expect
slow improvement in ceilings, likely to VFR late Wednesday
afternoon. Surface winds remain breezy through the day, mostly from
the south or southwest.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow will persist over the next several days,
with westerly pushes across the Strait of Juan de Fuca each
evening of varying degrees. Tonight`s push across the Strait has a
Small Craft Advisory in effect through early Wednesday morning. A
weak frontal system will move over the waters on Wednesday, with
surface winds becoming southwesterly behind the front. High
pressure will rebuild over the waters late in the week into the
weekend, with northwest flow establishing over the coastal waters.
Seas will generally be around 3-4 ft throughout the week and will
increase slightly into the weekend to 4-6 ft.
