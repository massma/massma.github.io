Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
756 PM PDT Mon Mar 17 2025

.SYNOPSIS...A trough will bring showers to the region tonight with
a convergence zone over King and snohomish counties. Upper level
ridging building briefly on Tuesday will give way to a break in
the wet weather. A series of systems will move over the region
later in the week through the weekend for rounds of lowland rain,
mountain snow, and breezy winds at times.


&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Convergence zone showers
are beginning to taper off as the bulk of it has reached the
Cascades. Spotty overnight showers will persist in places. No
other major forecast changes have been made this evening and the
rest of the previous discussion can be found below with udpates to
the aviation and marine segments.

A ridge moves inland on Tuesday for a mainly dry day. There still
is some lingering moisture but overall precipitation amounts look
light (if any). Afternoon highs are around 50 degrees for most
sites.

The ridge shifts farther inland on Wednesday, while a trough digs
offshore. The trough will push eastward Wednesday night with
showers increasing across the area. Snow levels will remain low,
around 2500`, and the mountains will see a few more inches of
accumulating snow. In addition, gusty S/SE winds are expected
along the coast and north interior with gusts to 45 MPH possible.

More wet and windy weather is headed our way Thursday/Thursday
night. Main impacts will again be possible heavy mountain snow and
gusty S winds at the coast and north interior. 33


.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Western WA remains under
strong, moist, SW flow on Friday with addition rounds of lowland
rain and mountain snow. Snow levels remain low enough for possible
accumulating snow at all Cascade passes.

The flow remains nearly zonal moving into the weekend, with precip
rates increasing on Sunday due to a warm front (especially over
the coast and mountains). Snow levels will be rising to over 6000`
by Sunday night, leading to mostly rain in the mountains. The warm
front slowly lifts north into B.C. as we move into Monday. The
main focus is on the river levels for any potential flooding,
which so far is limited only to the Skokomish River in Mason
County. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft will become more northwest flow by
Tuesday morning as weak ridging builds offshore. VFR cigs this
evening as showers become more and more isolated. The earlier
convergence zone is mainly over northeastern King county, now more a
concern for the mountains and passes. Cigs expected to lower again
by early Tuesday morning bottoming out between low-end VFR or MVFR.
There may be localized areas of IFR, as well as patchy fog
development in locations more prone to lower cigs...especially OLM.
Conditions will improve to VFR Tuesday afternoon. W/SW winds this
evening, with lingering N/NE winds north of the convergence zone in
central Puget Sound. Winds will become lighter tonight.


KSEA...Primarily VFR cigs into tonight. The convergence zone has
moved east of the terminal, although still seeing some NE winds from
it at the time of this writing. Expecting a transition to lighter
southerlies in the 03-06Z time frame. Cigs lowering to borderline
MVFR to low-end VFR Tuesday morning before recovering in the
afternoon, after 18-20Z.  JD/18<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow continues tonight before a brief surface
ridge builds on Tuesday. Small Craft Advisory westerly winds are
expected at times through this evening for the central and eastern
portions of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Another frontal system will
approach Western Washington on Wednesday for increasing S/SE winds.
A Gale Watch has been issued for the Coastal Waters Wednesday into
Wednesday night due to the increasing winds. There is also a slight
chance of storm force wind gusts for the outer Coastal Waters
Wednesday afternoon, but at this time confidence remains low.
Additional headlines are likely for portions of the interior waters
as well, especially for eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca, Admiralty
Inlet, and northern inland waters.

Winds will briefly ease early Thursday before increasing Thursday
night into Friday as another front moves across the area for
additional headlines. Winds will remain elevated at times over the
weekend with continued unsettled weather.

Seas of 7 to 9 feet will continue through Tuesday night. Seas will
build Wednesday into Thursday to 13 to 18 feet with the next weather
system. Seas will remain elevated, mainly above 10 feet, going into
next weekend. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...Heavy precipitation and higher snow levels will lead
to rising rivers moving into late this weekend and early next
week. So far only the Skokomish River in Mason County is rising
above flood stage.
