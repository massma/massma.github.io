Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
214 AM PDT Sat Sep 7 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Temperatures will moderate over the weekend as a low
pressure system swings across the Pacific Northwest. Cooler
conditions with periods of showers are on track to return next
week as troughing moves across the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough will
continue to push into western Oregon this morning, causing an
influx of cloud cover and some virga showers south of the Puget
Sound. A lightning strike or two cannot be ruled out in any
stronger showers that develop, though confidence is low with
forecast models showing a low (less than 10%) probability. While
the dry surface layer will limit most precipitation from reaching
the ground, southerly flow aloft will bring in more elevated haze
from area wildfires. Forecast models are in good agreement over
high temperatures in the 70s along the coast and in the 80s
further inland, though slightly cooler temperatures are possible
depending on the extent of elevated smoke that moves into the area
today.

Onshore flow will increase on Sunday as the trough axis crosses
the region, allowing temperatures to continue to decrease across
western Washington. Coastal areas are on track to see highs in the
60s while inland areas see temperatures peaking in the upper 70s
to low 80s. This will allow HeatRisk to return to minor (yellow)
for most of the region apart from pockets of moderate (orange)
HeatRisk in urban areas east of the Puget Sound. Elevated smoke
aloft will continue into Sunday with slow improvement, which may
continue to impact temperatures. Forecast models highlight a
chance of showers and thunderstorm activity developing over the
mountains Sunday afternoon, though probabilities remain low.

Flow will become more zonal by Monday with increased onshore flow
and a marine stratus push in the morning. Temperatures will return
to near-normal with highs in the 60s and 70s.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Long range models continue
to favor troughing and cooler temperatures throughout next week.
Troughing will deepen offshore on Tuesday, allowing temperatures
to further decrease and introducing the next chance for showers
across western Washington. Unsettled and cooler conditions will
continue into Wednesday with rainfall accumulations of half an
inch or less, mostly across the Olympic Peninsula and Cascades.
Troughing will push eastward towards the end of next week,
allowing conditions to dry out while maintaining below-normal
temperatures.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Thermal troughing moving inland today will bring back
onshore flow, yet prolific wildfire smoke from Oregon will remain
aloft. This could cause some slantwise visibility concerns
throughout the day as there will be increased concentrations of
smoke in the mid to upper atmosphere. HZ likely to be expanded in
the area TAFs throughout the day. Stratus will be moving inland
early this morning but only making it as far as the Lower Chehalis
Valley. Stratus retreating back to the coastline by 18z. Cloudless
skies for the remainder of the area with elevated smoke increasing
today.

KSEA...Clear skies with increasing elevated smoke. Could see some
slightly reduced surface visibilities, 6 or 7 sm, 12z-16z in haze as
well as slantwise visibility reductions today. Northerly winds 4
to 8 knots, indicating a turn back to the west to southwest after
06Z Sunday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure at the surface will continue to build over
the coastal waters with the thermally induced surface trough inland.
Light onshore flow will increase today as the thermal trough moves
east. Onshore flow pattern will continue over the next several days.
A weak low pressure system may move into the coastal waters Tuesday
into Wednesday for a chance of rain.

Kristell<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper-ridging and an associated surface thermal
trough will continue critical fire weather conditions. Hot, dry, and
unstable conditions will remain through Saturday for the Olympic
zones 652/661 and Cascade zones 658/659. A return to onshore flow
this morning will begin to bring cooler, moist air to the coast
and Olympics. However, the marine influence is expected to be
shallow leaving higher elevations within the Olympic mountains
still exposed to low RH values. Something we`ll continue to
monitor. Red Flag Warnings over the mountain zones remain in place
for today due to continued hot, dry and unstable conditions.
Also, a less than 10% chance of showers and thunderstorms exist
this afternoon for the mountains as well.

Cooler and more moist air will return area-wide on Sunday with the
potential of some wetting rains by mid-week.
