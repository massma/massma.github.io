.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge will maintain warm and dry
conditions over western Washington today and early Saturday. An
upper level low will move in Sunday, bringing a return to cooler
and cloudy conditions and well as chances for scattered showers
into early next week. Drier conditions look to temporarily return
mid to late next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
stratus along the coast slowly creeping inland through the valleys
of southwestern Washington as well as down the Strait of Juan de
Fuca. Surface observations and traffic cameras are showing this to
be mostly stratus,though there is sufficient low level moisture
such that some patchy fog mixed in there at times. Fog may be
locally dense in some spots. Come sunrise this morning, expect
most of the western Washington lowlands to be under stratus and
patchy fog. This will help moderate low temperatures this morning,
bottoming out in the upper 30s to low 40s.

Stratus should quickly lift and scatter, giving way to mostly
clear skies this afternoon. With the upper level ridge axis having
moved eastward over the intermountain west and the cloud cover
this morning, this should help to slightly damper today`s high
temperature compared to Thursday, through still reaching the mid
50s to low 60s. Lows again in the upper 30s to low 40s.

An upper level trough will begin to approach the area this
weekend. Cloud cover will begin to increase Saturday through most,
except for the coast, look to remain dry during the day Saturday.
Highs Saturday will still be in the upper 50s to low 60s through
the interior, though cooler (low 50s) along the coast. Mid to
upper 60s may be possible in the Cascade valleys.

The best chances for precipitation will be Sunday into Monday as
the system moves onshore, but there is little moisture to work
with and the low center moves southeastward towards California,
bringing with it the better forcing. QPF amounts will be on the
order of hundredths to a few tenths of an inch through Monday.
Snow levels 3500 to 4500 ft will mean only a dusting of snow at
the higher passes and ski resorts. Cloudier and cooler conditions
will accompany this system, with highs in the low 50s and lows in
the 40s.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Light precipitation
chances linger into Monday. Tuesday, or at least early Tuesday,
may be dry as a transient upper level ridge crosses the region
before troughing returns Wednesday into Thursday. Deterministic
model solutions diverge at this point, and ensemble cluster
analysis shows a wide range of potential solutions, ranging from
another ridge beginning to build back just offshore to a deep
trough or closed low over central California. Most ensembles are
showing at least light precipitation throughout the long-term
period, so kept slight chances to chances of showers in the
forecast. High temperatures look to remain in the low 50s with
lows in the mid 30s to low 40s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge over the area today will shift east
tonight. A front will split offshore Saturday. Westerly flow aloft
becoming southwesterly this afternoon. Light flow in the lower
levels into Saturday.

Stratus along the coast has moved inland down the Strait of Juan
de Fuca and through the Lower Chehalis Valley into the south Puget
Sound. LIFR ceilings with local visibility a mile or less with the
stratus except up near Bellingham where ceilings are near 4000
feet. The LIFR stratus will continue to slowly converge on the
central Puget Sound through 16z with a possible gap near KSEA.
Stratus will retreat back to the coast 19z-21z with MVFR ceilings
along the coast into Saturday morning. Similar pattern for
Saturday morning with the stratus possibly arriving a couple hours
earlier than today.

KSEA...Tough call at KSEA this morning. Stratus to the north near
the KIng/Snohomish county line at 11z. To the south the stratus
just starting to move into Tacoma. Stratus briefly reaching the
terminal between 15z and 18z with LIFR ceilings and reduced
visibility. VFR conditions by 19z with VFR continuing into
Saturday morning. LIFR stratus could arrive a couple hours earlier
Saturday morning, around 14z. Light, 6 knots or less, northerly
winds through the period. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the area today and tonight will
weaken Saturday. A trough digs southward across the offshore
waters Saturday into Sunday. A weak trough will remain over area
waters Monday with a front arriving late Tuesday.

Seas in the offshore waters building to 10 to 15 feet tonight
subsiding to 10 to 13 feet Saturday night and to 10 to 12 feet
Sunday. Seas continuing to subside to below 10 feet by Monday.

Seas in the inner coastal waters, out to 10 nm, building to 9
to 13 feet tonight.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No river flooding is expected in the next 7 days. The
