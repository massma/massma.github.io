National Weather Service Seattle WA

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level troughing over the region will persist
over the next several days, promoting onshore flow and cooler
temperatures. Showers will be mainly over the Cascades with a
chance of showers over the rest of western Washington over the
weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Troughing over the Pac NW
will bring cloudier and cooler weather to western WA today through
Tuesday. Expected high temperatures will be in the 60s to lower
70s with lows in the 50s. There is a slight chance of showers and
thunderstorms during the afternoon and early evening hours in the
North Cascades, especially near the crest. 33

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Troughing continues
into the rest of the week and weekend as a low drops down from
Canada. Temperatures will be a little warmer and closer to normal
with highs in the mid to upper 70s. The coast will remain in the
60s with NW winds. Showers will be mostly over the Cascades
Thursday and Friday, with showers expanding to the rest of western
WA on Saturday as the upper low pulls in some moisture. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest flow aloft with upper level troughing over
the region. Marine stratus is building inland and becoming
widespread yet again across western WA. Ceilings under the stratus
are ranging between MVFR to LIFR, as well as isolated vis
restrictions. Stratus will be slow to retreat this this afternoon
for the interior with a gradual return to VFR conditions after 18-
21z. The coast, however, does not look to clear out today and will
remain under low ceilings through the TAF period. Another widespread
push of marine stratus is likely to redevelop overnight into Monday
morning. Winds will remain west-southwesterly 5 to 10 kt throughout
the TAF period.

KSEA...IFR cigs have returned and look to remain that way for the
most of the morning. Ceilings may rise a touch to low-end MVFR
before improving to VFR the 21Z Sunday to 00z Monday window. Winds
remain southwesterly 5 to 10 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A broad 1032mb NE Pacific surface high is well offshore
but is maintaining onshore flow here across area waters. SCA through
the central/eastern strait continues but should be allowed to expire
here this morning. The SCA for the outer coastal waters will persist
well into the day due to steep seas of 6 to 9 ft along with a
dominant period of 8 seconds. Seas will subside on Monday back to 3
to 5 ft and remain like so through the week.
