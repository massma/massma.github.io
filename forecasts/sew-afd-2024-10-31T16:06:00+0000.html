Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
906 AM PDT Thu Oct 31 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Unsettled weather will continue through the weekend as
an upper trough offshore slowly progresses across the Pacific
Northwest. Another frontal system is expected Monday into early
Tuesday for additional precipitation. Some ridging may bring drier
weather during the middle of next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Latest radar imagery shows a
large band of showers over the majority of the Olympic Peninsula
slowly making progress eastward as moisture continues to spin around
the parent upper level low off the BC coast. Latest satellite as
well as a look out the NWS office window shows some breaks in the
clouds overhead...however given the activity to the west, any peeks
of sun will largely be short-lived.

Inherited forecast is on track as models remain in lockstep
regarding the upper low off the BC coast. This system will shift
eastward slowly, keeping active conditions over W WA at least
through Saturday morning. Although the upper low shifts east of the
area by mid Saturday morning, a secondary frontal system hot on its
heels may result in a tiny break...at best 3-6 hours...before rain
resumes over the CWA.

There are some finer points to consider from inherited forecast.
Some interesting radar activity during the overnight and early
morning hours suggests some instability over the coastal waters.
Model data suggests a low, yet interesting, amount of CAPE...but
positive LI values seemingly offset this. Current forecast uses
slight chance wording when it comes to thunderstorm potential and
while no additional activity has been spotted over the waters, the
fact that it did occur already suggests that wording to be likely
right on track for much of the day. Additionally, the development of
a weak surface low is possible along the WA/OR border which may give
a boost to wind speeds Friday afternoon. Latest progs suggest that
while there may be some minor increase in speeds in the area, this
looks to be more impactful south of the CWA.

Lastly, inherited winter weather headlines look good as data still
supports previous forecast, with snow levels in the near term
generally in the 3500 to 4500 ft range. Forecast snowfall amounts
through Friday range from 15 to 25 inches for Paradise and 8 to 12
inches for White Pass. Snow amounts for Rainy Pass through Friday
are 4 to 8 inches. Lesser amounts are expected for Stevens Pass of 3
to 6 inches, with less than 2 inches of snow at Snoqualmie Pass. As
such, do not see the need to expand current headlines for now,
however will re-evaluate with 12Z data.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...From Previous
Discussion...Unsettled weather is expected to continue into Sunday
with periodic showers, especially in the Cascades due to increasing
northwest flow aloft. Another frontal system is expected to move
across Western Washington Monday into Monday night for additional
lowland rain, mountain snow, and breezy winds. Snow levels during
this period are forecast to range 4000 to 4500 feet. Ensembles then
suggest ridging nudges into the area later Tuesday into Wednesday,
for potentially drier conditions. Temperatures during this period
generally near to slightly below normal. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft as an upper-low meanders off the BC
coast. A mix of MVFR/VFR ceilings with scattered showers this
morning. Showers will transition to widespread rain in the afternoon-
evening along with VFR cigs becoming more prevalent. However, lower
ceilings (MVFR) may remain along the coast. Rain looks to remain
overnight into Friday morning as MVFR cigs become more widespread.

KSEA...VFR cigs throughout much of the day today. HREF Grand
Ensemble indicates a 10-20% chance of ceilings dropping below 3,000
ft this morning, increasing to 40-50% chance at times during the
afternoon under passing showers. MVFR ceilings will become more
likely overnight as showers transition to more steadier rainfall
around 04-06z Friday. SSE surface winds will remain around 4 to 8 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface low currently off the coast of Haida Gwaii will
gradually fill and position west of Vancouver Island today. Hazards
that remain in effect include SCA for coastal waters, Grays Harbor
Bar and West Entrance due to hazardous seas. A SCA also exists for
the East Entrance. Here, winds may be below advisory threshold at
times through much of the morning but criteria will again be met
towards the second half of the day as southeasterly winds increase.
Confidence is increasing on an additional surface low spinning up
over the offshore waters on Friday, tracking ENE into inland waters.
SCA winds may remain over the Strait during this time. Weak surface
ridging rebuilds over the waters latter half of the weekend before
another front arrives on Monday.

Seas 12 to 14 feet through tonight and will remain above 10 feet
into Friday. Another large swell train is expected by Sunday.
