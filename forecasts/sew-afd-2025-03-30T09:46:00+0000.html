Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
246 AM PDT Sun Mar 30 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak high pressure will provide drier and mild
conditions today for most areas. Another disturbance arrives
tonight with additional chances for showers and a return to
cooler conditions through the middle of the week. Drier and
warmer conditions then return as high pressure rebuilds into
Western Washington toward the end of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High level clouds are
already spreading over the region early this morning ahead of the
next system offshore. The low level flow will turn increasingly
offshore today and this will aid in boosting temperatures...particularly
across the interior lowlands...where lower 60s are expected this
afternoon. Shower activity should hold off along the coast until
late this afternoon then gradually spread inland tonight. The air
mass will start off rather dry in the low levels...and this along
with the showery nature looks to limit QPF. Scattered showers will
continue into Monday across Western Washington as the upper level
low wobbles just offshore. The upper low is expected to move
onshore over Oregon on Tuesday taking most shower activity with
it...leaving much of Western Washington more dry than wet with
near seasonal temperatures.


.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Model agreement is a
little better in the long term, though certainly not optimal.
Western Washington will remain on the back side of broad upper
troughing over the Western U.S. Wednesday into Thursday with
another disturbance digging southward over the western Canadian
provinces. This keeps a chance of showers in the forecast, but
it`s not a particularly wet pattern. Ensemble clusters are showing
better agreement toward the end of the week with some high
amplitude upper ridging building into British Columbia. There`s
still some uncertainty with the strength of the ridge, but 500
millibar heights in the lower to mid 570s dam and weak low level
offshore flow could boost much of the area into the mid to upper
60s by Saturday with plenty of sunshine. Looks like I`ll need to
clean up the barbecue and tune up the bike. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southerly flow aloft throughout the period as a trough
meanders offshore. Mostly VFR currently aside from patchy fog at
terminals such as KOLM, KCLM, etc. High clouds are pushing northward
and should limit fog coverage as the morning progress. VFR expected
for today but, rain will begin between 00-03z Monday and with it
instances of MVFR cigs/vis are possible. A mix of VFR and MVFR again
expected overnight Sunday into early Monday. Easterly wind gusts up
to 20-25 kt are favored today for some terminals such as KHQM.

KSEA...VFR conditions expected to persist through today and much of
the upcoming period. A brief window a MVFR cigs exists this evening
(00-03z) as rain spreads overhead. However, probabilities for the
occurrence is low (less than 30%) so most likely forecast suggests
VFR. Northerly winds 5 to 10 kt will switch easterly by 18-20z with
gusts up to 25 kt possible. Winds decrease and become SE overnight
into early Monday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Offshore flow will increase today as a 990 mb surface low
develops well offshore. With it, breezy easterly winds through the
strait are favored as a SCA has been issued for the northern coastal
water zones starting this morning. Some isolated SCA gusts are
possible in the West Strait during this time. A southerly wind
switch during this afternoon-evening will allow for SCA winds to
expand to the remainder of the coastal water zones through Monday.
Additional headlines may need to be expanded to some inland water
zones such as East Strait, Admiralty Inlet, etc. on Monday as well.
The pattern will remain active into Tuesday but uncertainty exists
midweek onward. Seas 4 to 6 ft today increasing to 7 to 9 ft on
Monday and briefly above 10 ft Monday night.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The Skokomish River will remain in action stage into
midweek, but overall QPF through the week ahead does not look
sufficient to produce any flood concerns there or along any other
rivers across the region through the upcoming week. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
