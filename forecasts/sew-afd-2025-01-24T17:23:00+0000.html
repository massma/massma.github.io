.SYNOPSIS...Weak system moving south of the area early this
morning. Upper level ridge building offshore with dry
northeasterly flow aloft beginning later today. Offshore upper
level ridge building into Northern British Columbia over the
weekend with the ridge moving directly over Western Washington
Monday and Tuesday. Ridge shifting east Wednesday with first
organized front in a few days arriving Thursday.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Satellite imagery shows weak
shortwave over the central portion of Western Washington moving
south. Cloudy skies over most of the area with some clearing
already over Whatcom county. Doppler radar has shower activity
over the Central Puget Sound dissipating at 2 am/10z. With the
cloud cover temperatures much warmer than previous mornings with
mid 30s to lower 40s. The exception to this is Whatcom county
where the clearing skies have allowed temperatures to drop once
again into the 20s.

Shortwave moving south of the area this morning. Dry
northeasterly flow aloft developing with an upper level ridge
building offshore. Skies clearing from the north this morning
with mostly clear skies by mid afternoon. Highs in the lower to
mid 40s.

Upper level ridge offshore nosing into British Columbia over the
weekend with dry northeasterly flow aloft. In the lower levels
light offshore flow developing tonight and continuing through
the weekend. Patchy freezing fog in the usual places like the
Southwest Interior in the early morning hours both Saturday and
Sunday. Fog that does form will be shallow and dissipate by mid
morning. Otherwise more of the same with sunny days and clear
nights. Highs in the mid 40s. Lows tonight into the 20s and lower
30s. Lows Saturday night a couple of degrees cooler. Could need a
cold weather advisory for some locations for Saturday night/early
Sunday morning in future forecast packages.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement again this morning. Upper level ridge moving directly
over Western Washington Monday with the ridge remaining in place
Tuesday. Two more days of what we have seen the most of the
second half of January, patchy morning freezing fog otherwise
sunny days and clear nights. Highs in the lower to mid 40s. Lows
in the 20s and lower 30s.

Changes in the pattern beginning Wednesday with the upper level
ridge moving off to the east. One more sunny day with patchy
morning freezing fog. Highs in the lower to mid 40s and lows in
the 20s to lower 30s.

Organized front approaching Wednesday night with the front moving
through the area Thursday. Good chance this feature gives Western
Washington the most rain we have seen since January 4th. Snow
levels 2500 to 3000 feet with the mountains getting a few inches
of new snow. Felton

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northerly flow aloft will develop over Western
Washington today with upper ridging poised offshore and an upper
trough digging southward over the Northern Rockies. Remnant low
level moisture from an overnight system will scour out today and the
air mass will dry out with increasingly low level northerly flow.
Patchy LIFR freezing fog is expected to be restricted to the
Southwest Interior and extreme south Puget Sound Saturday morning.

KSEA...High end MVFR ceilings are expected to scatter out by around
20Z with mostly clear skies developing this afternoon and tonight.
Surface winds will become northerly and increase to 10 to 14 knots
this afternoon. Winds will ease to northeasterly 7 knots or less
this evening.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface ridging strengthens over interior British
Columbia and east of the Cascades today into Saturday while a broad
surface trough deepens well to the south over California. This will
lead to increasing northerly or weak offshore flow. This general
pattern remains in place into early next week. A weak surface trough
develops over the coastal waters early next week for a slightly more
offshore component to the flow. The next front will approach the
coastal waters around midweek.

Seas will peak early this morning around 7 to 11 ft, with the
highest waves over the outermost coastal waters, and will ease
today. Seas will subside to around 4 to 6 ft this weekend and
through next week, until the next system arrives late week.
