Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
908 AM PDT Mon Oct 28 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Showery, cool conditions will gradually taper off today
as an upper level trough passes over the region. Briefly drier
conditions will develop Monday night and Tuesday before a vigorous
frontal system produces additional rain, mountain snow, and locally
windy conditions midweek. A trend toward somewhat drier conditions
is expected by the end of the week into the weekend.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The following forecast
discussion remains on track with no updates this morning:

Scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms continue across
western Washington as a low pressure, currently centered over the
northern tip of Vancouver Island, moves south across the area and
weakens. Showers will continue throughout the day today, finally
tapering off tonight. With snow levels right around 4000 ft,
higher elevation passes will see some light snow accumulations,
with the most snow expected across the North Cascades. Breezy
winds will also be able to subside this morning.

A transient shortwave ridge will build over the area Monday night
into Tuesday, allowing conditions to mostly dry out. Another cold
front will follow close by, bringing another shot of rain and
breezy winds on Wednesday. With lowering snow levels to around
3500 ft, mountain passes (including Stevens Pass) have better
chances of receiving significant accumulating snow. Overall the
QPF forecast is a bit lower, with around a quarter to three-
quarters of an inch through the lowlands, and up to around 2
inches through the mountains and along the Pacific coast.

Overall, the temperatures remain consistent, with highs in the
mid 50s and lows in the upper 30s to low 40s.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...The parent low pressure
system will move southward into the region on Thursday, keeping rain
and mountain snow showers in the forecast, though mostly in the
southern portions of the region. Looking at the upper level pattern,
the associated upper level trough will move through on Thursday,
with an upper level trough that looks to form over the East
Pacific late week and move into our area by this weekend. The mean
solution indicates that this weekend will be mostly dry, through
there are hints of a potential shortwave trough that may move
through the ridge, keeping slight chances of precipitation through
the weekend as well. Temperatures continue to remain consistent
with highs in the mid 50s and lows in the upper 30s to low 40s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper trough axis over Western Washington
this morning will shift east of the Cascades this afternoon with
westerly flow aloft becoming north to northwesterly tonight.
Scattered showers producing occasional MVFR ceilings will diminish
by this evening with the exception of some weak convergence zone
activity over central Puget Sound. Surface winds will ease today. A
combination of light wind and abundant low level moisture will
produce widespread low MVFR ceilings across the area late tonight
through Tuesday morning.

KSEA...Predominantly VFR ceilings, though rain showers will remain
possible throughout the day and may bring brief reductions in
ceilings and visibilities at times. Southerly winds will ease
towards 5-10 kts by this afternoon. Convergence zone may sink
south into the terminal tonight, bringing light, variable winds
between 02-05Z. 14/27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...The pattern remains active as a low pressure system
moves southward along British Columbia today and then moves inland
by this evening. Breezy winds will gradually continue to ease
across the interior waters through the morning hours today. Winds
look to remain breezy along the outer coastal waters through much
of the day, however the bigger impact remains the seas - which
continue to range between 14-18 ft early this morning. As a
result, have extended the small craft advisories in effect
through this evening for the coastal waters (for winds and seas)
and the West Entrance of the Strait of Juan de Fuca (for seas).
Rough to very steep conditions will continue on Grays Harbor Bar
today as well.

High pressure returns to the coastal waters on Tuesday, allowing
for winds to ease and for seas to subside. The reprieve remains
short-lived, however, as a strong frontal system arrives by
Wednesday and brings another round of strong winds and significantly
building seas. Latest guidance indicates a 60-70 percent chance
of gales across the coastal waters and eastern Strait as the
frontal system moves across the region on Wednesday. The next Gulf
of Alaska low will quickly follow, dropping southward into the
region on Thursday before moving inland Thursday night into
Friday. Seas look to build back towards 16-18 ft by Thursday
morning and look to gradually subside through Friday. 14
