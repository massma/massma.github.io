Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
255 PM PDT Fri Jul 4 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Seasonal temperatures early in the holiday weekend
will be replaced by a warming trend early next week as an upper
ridge strengthens over Western Washington. The ridge will weaken
and onshore flow will increase for a cooling trend in the second
half of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper trough over the
region will shift eastward tonight. Increasing onshore flow behind
it will lead to additional cloud cover overnight into Saturday
morning. Temperatures on Saturday will remain near or slightly
below normal. A warming trend commences Sunday into Monday as an
upper level ridge rebuilds. High temperatures will get back into
the lower to mid 80s from the Seattle area southward by Monday.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The upper ridge remains
firmly in control on Tuesday with light onshore flow. Interior
temperatures from central Puget Sound southward peak in the mid to
upper 80s with mostly lower to mid 70s coast and North Interior.
An overall trend toward a flattening ridge, increasing onshore
flow, and a cooling trend is still expected for the second half of
next week. There is, however, enough of a spread in the ensembles
to lend a considerable degree of uncertainty to the extent of the
cooling. The ongoing theme of typically dry conditions for July
continues.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Expect upper level flow to become increasingly
westerly overnight through Saturday with the region sitting in
between a disturbance crossing central British Columbia to the north
and another off the northern California coast. Onshore low-level
flow will strengthen this evening and continue Saturday. Expect
variable high clouds through the day across Western Washington. Weak
convergence across central Puget Sound could bring some ceilings
around 5000 ft or so, with increasing west winds across KCLM and
through Whidbey Island, northerly winds through the northern Puget
Sound region and south/southwest winds in the South Sound. MVFR
stratus remains along the coast or just offshore this afternoon, but
returns more solidly into the coastal areas 06-09z tonight. This
stratus spreads inland into Puget Sound toward 12z. Additionally,
some haze across the metro corridors is possible late evening/early
tonight as stability increases and holiday related celebrations
occur.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

KSEA...Variable high clouds with the potential for some mid-level
ceilings around 5000 ft expected into the afternoon as weak
convergences develops. Expect mostly light winds early afternoon
with some variability in direction, becoming predominantly southerly
this evening. MVFR stratus redeveloping around 12z before scattering
mid-late morning Saturday. Cullen

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure remains in place across the coastal waters
with high pressure strengthening early next week. Meanwhile,
diurnally west pushes through the Strait of Juan de Fuca will
continue each evening during the evening hours. Tonight`s push is
the strongest of the next few days and have maintained the gale
warning for the central and eastern Strait, though the confidence in
duration and coverage of strongest winds has decreased a bit.
Regardless, expect a weaker push tomorrow evening but still may need
an advisory for that round. Seas will increase over the coastal
waters early next week as persistent northerly wind build steeper
conditions. A weak front will approach the northern coastal waters
Tuesday.      Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
