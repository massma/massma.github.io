Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
839 AM PDT Fri May 2 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Chances of showers return today as high pressure moves
further inland and an upper level trough approaches the coast.
Unsettled conditions will persist into Saturday, before high
pressure builds back into the region on Sunday. Warm and dry
conditions are expected through the first part of next week,
before chances of showers return near midweek.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The latest forecast remains
on track with no updates this morning. The upper level ridge axis
over the region will push further inland today as an upper level
trough approaches the coast. At the surface, a weak frontal
system will make its way across western Washington and will bring
the next round of shower chances to the region. Rain will approach
the coast this afternoon and then slowly make its way into the
interior late tonight into early Saturday. Areas east of the
Olympics will likely be rain shadowed initially as the system
progresses inland. Overall rainfall amounts will remain rather
light, with many spots only seeing a few hundredths to a tenth of
an inch. Satellite imagery early this morning shows some low
stratus starting to develop along the coast. Expect temperatures
along the coast to cool today with highs only making it into the
mid to upper 50s under increasing cloud cover. Southerly flow
aloft and sun into the afternoon will allow for warmer temperatures
across the interior, with highs expected to top out in the upper
60s to mid 70s.

The upper level trough will move inland on Saturday, keeping
conditions cool and unsettled for the start of the weekend.
Increasing onshore flow in the wake of the frontal system will
allow for some light convergence showers to persist across
portions of the south and central Sound Saturday morning. However,
expect showers to gradually become more confined to the mountains
throughout the day. Afternoon high temperatures will cool to the
mid 50s to low 60s for the majority of the area.

The upper level trough will move to the east on Sunday as upper
level ridging starts to build back into the region from the
northeastern Pacific. This will mark the start of the next warming
and drying trend for the area, with afternoon highs expected to
warm a couple degrees from Saturday. Temperatures look to top out
in the upper 50s for the coast and in the low to mid 60s across
the interior.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Upper level ridging will
remain the dominant influence across the region through the start
of week, promoting warm and dry conditions across western Washington.
High temperatures look to warm into the upper 60s and low 70s for
the interior on Monday, with temperatures expected to warm a few
degrees further on Tuesday. This would bring the return of Minor
(Yellow) HeatRisk to portions of the interior lowlands. Areas
along the coast will remain cooler, with highs generally expected
to be in the low to mid 60s.

Uncertainty remains in the pattern heading into midweek, with
deterministic guidance hinting at the upper ridge pushing inland
on Wednesday and for weak systems to begin moving into the area.
Meanwhile, ensemble clusters look to hold onto the ridge a little
longer and only show it pushing inland on Thursday. Will need to
see how guidance continues to trend over the next few days, however
have maintained the return of showers to the forecast on Wednesday
for now. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper ridge axis will move into the Northern Rockies
today with increasing south to southwest flow aloft over Western
Washington ahead of an approaching upper trough and associated weak
frontal system. Increasing low level onshore flow will lead to a
developing marine layer producing IFR or low MVFR ceilings along the
coast. Increasing high and mid level clouds are expected across the
interior. Ceilings will lower to MVFR across interior areas
overnight as shower activity spreads inland with the weak front.

KSEA...VFR today with increasing high and mid level clouds after
around 18Z. Ceilings will lower to MVFR toward 06Z tonight as a few
showers spread across the area. Surface winds light southerly early
becoming southwesterly this afternoon and increasing to 8 to 12
knots. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weakening frontal system will move onshore across
Western Washington late this afternoon. Increasing onshore flow will
develop in its wake. A strengthening surface ridge over the coastal
and offshore waters with lower pressure east of the Cascades will
lead to continuing onshore flow over the weekend. Onshore flow will
relax somewhat early next week as the offshore ridge weakens. A
weakening front will approach the waters toward the middle of next
week. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

start of the next rainy season; it will only be updated if needed.
