Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
732 AM EDT Sun Jul 28 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure remains over the area through this afternoon.
An offshore low approaches southern New England tonight and
moves through New England Monday before dissipating by Monday
evening. Several disturbances move through the area over the
week resulting in unsettled conditions.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
The offshore low is beginning to track toward the northwest to
north and clouds are increasing to the east of Long Island. No
significant changes were made with this morning`s update.

Surface high pressure remains in control through today.
However, with increased confidence in the track of offshore low
pressure, and an upper cutoff low, chances of precipitation by
late in the day are possible mainly across the twin forks of
Long Island.

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT/...
The global guidance, and CAMs, are in good agreement with the
surface low tracking through New England tonight into Monday,
before dissipating late in the day over northern New England.
Meanwhile, the upper low tracks northwestward near eastern Long
Island and through New England, and into southeastern Canada
tonight through Monday night. With measurable precipitation
likely, especially the eastern half of the region, have
increased probabilities to likely, and these may be increased to
categorical later. With the upper low tracking north Monday
night, and some isentropic lift, have kept at least slight
chances through the night.

&&

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
Key Points:

* Multiple rounds of showers and thunderstorms possible through the
  week.

* Increasing heat and humidity will increase chances for heat
  indices approaching and/or exceeding 95F for the second half of
  the week.

A departing upper low over the Northeast at the start of the period
will open up a parade of disturbances in the westerlies through the
upcoming week. Throughout the period there will be chances for
showers and thunderstorms. The best chance at this time looks to be
Wednesday/Wednesday night with an incoming upper trough. The
environment during this time will feature marginal to moderate
instability and generally weak deep-layered shear. There are some
timing issues with the global models in how quickly the upper low
lifts out of the Northeast and with the disturbances riding the
westerlies across the norther tier of the conus. PWAT values by
midweek will get up to around 2 inches, so heavy rainfall is a
likelihood with any convection. Still though, it is too early to be
specific with details. Another more organized mid-level disturbance
may approach the area into next weekend.

In addition, it will become increasingly humid through mid week,
likely persist into next weekend. The latter half of the week will
feature highs in the mid 80s to the lower 90s with dew points around
70. This results in heat indices 95 or higher for a good portion of
the area. Timing of convection and associated cloud cover will be
complicating factors in the temperatures forecast. The high humidity
will be courtesy of a prolonged period of southerly flow. This will
also keep overnight lows several degrees above normal.

&&

.AVIATION /12Z SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure remains over or near the terminals today. Weak
low pressure approaches the area from the east late tonight into
Monday.

VFR through tonight. MVFR possible, mainly for eastern terminals
(KGON, KISP, KBDR) late tonight with -SHRA approaching from the
east. There may be some -TSRA but too uncertain to include in
the TAFs at this time. Coverage in shower activity near the NYC
terminals uncertain at this time, but more likely for eastern
terminals. Kept any shower activity for western terminals in a
PROB30 at this time from 6-12Z. Any SHRA expected to weaken
after 12Z near the NYC metro.

Light and variable winds into this morning. Winds become more S-SE 5-
10kt by early afternoon. Winds then gradually back through the
night to the W and possibly NW with the low approaching from the
east.

     NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

No unscheduled amendments expected through this evening.
Coverage in shower activity uncertain, mainly after 6Z.

OUTLOOK FOR 12Z MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...

Monday: Mainly VFR....MVFR or IFR possible far eastern terminals.
Chance of showers and thunderstorms, mainly for eastern
terminals.

Tuesday and Wednesday: Chance of MVFR or lower in scattered showers
and thunderstorms. S winds G15-20kt.

Thursday: Chance of MVFR in afternoon showers/thunderstorms. SW wind
5-10kts.

.MARINE...
Winds and seas remain below SCA levels across the forecast
waters today through Monday night. However, with offshore low
pressure approaching the southern New England coast tonight, and
moving through New England Monday, ocean seas east of Fire
Island Inlet may approach 5 feet by late day Monday into Monday
evening. With low confidence, and third into the fourth period
will hold off on an advisory.

Sub SCA conditions likely for mid to late week with a weak pressure
gradient.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
Multiple rounds of showers and thunderstorms are possible
through the upcoming week. However, it is too early to be
specific with hydrologic impacts.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
There is a low risk for the development of rip currents at the
ocean beaches today. Monday will likely start off with a low
risk, then with building seas on the ocean due to an offshore
low, the rip current risk increases to moderate during the
afternoon, especially by late in the day.

&&

.OKX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CT...None.
NY...None.
NJ...None.
MARINE...None.
