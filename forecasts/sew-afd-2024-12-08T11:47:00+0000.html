Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
347 AM PST Sun Dec 8 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A low pressure system will continue to produce areas
of precipitation through Sunday afternoon, including snow in the
mountains, and rain in the lowlands. A couple of dry days will
follow on Monday and Tuesday as high pressure builds back in. The
pattern will return to unsettled on Wednesday through next weekend
with several systems passing through bringing additional chances
of precipitation.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weakening upper level and
surface low sits in the northern half of British Columbia this
morning, with the trough axis extended down into northern
California/Nevada, driving the polar jet stream through southern
Washington and Oregon. The low will continue to fill in and move
inland today.

Precipitation continues across western Washington this morning
from a surface trough just off the coast. A previous cold frontal
boundary yesterday has brought snow levels down to around 3,000
feet as of yesterday. This has transition the precipitation to
snow in the mountains, with a lot more still to fall in the
Cascades and Olympics this morning. The heaviest of this QPF will
be concentrated in the Cascades, where showers will likely linger
longer post front through the evening (via convergence zone).
Still expecting another half inch to an inch and a half of QPF
through the day today in this region (equivalent to an additional
6 to 12 inches at Snoqualmie/Stevens/White Passes). Some of the
highest peaks may see as much as 2 feet of snow all set and done.
Will continue the winter headlines in place, and again the
heaviest of the snow will fall through around noon before tapering
down this afternoon. Rates may reach 1-2 inches an hour
(especially in convergence/convective areas).

For lowland areas, the activity will continue to produce rain showers
throughout the morning. Coverage is not expected to be as
widespread today. This will limit QPF to around a tenth to a
quarter of an inch for most areas (half an inch along the coast).
Additionally, for beaches along the Pacific Coast, waves are
expected to remain below 20 ft (closer to 16 ft) - below the
threshold needed for a high surf advisory. The breezy south winds
in the Cascades will diminish going into the afternoon as well,
and they will be light out of the south everywhere else.

Moving ahead, the trough/low will move inland today and again fill
over the Northern Plains. A ridge will follow the trough - expect
high pressure to begin building back in Monday and Tuesday. Cloud
cover (with some patchy fog) will slowly decrease Monday with
some sunshine by the afternoon. The polar jet will bring some
cooler Canadian air in, which will knock high and low temperatures
down into the mid 40s/low 30s respectively.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Majority of the models
are now showing a shortwave trough following the ridge Wednesday
into Thursday with an associated frontal system. This will
increase precipitation chances Wednesday into Thursday (but it
does not appear the precipitation will be heavy at this time). A
more prominent trough appears to develop next weekend, but there`s
no good agreement at this time on where it will go inland, or how
strong it will be. Temperatures will remain relatively steady with
lows in the mid 30s, and highs in the 40s.
