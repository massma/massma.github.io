.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure will bring drier conditions to
the region on Thursday, with patchy fog possible during the
morning hours. Lowland rain, mountain snow, and breezy conditions
return on Friday as a frontal system moves across Western
Washington. Showers expected to linger through the weekend. Dry
conditions return early next week as high pressure rebuilds.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
some of the low stratus over Western Washington has scattered and
allowed some locations to see some blue skies. Dry conditions are
expected to continue into Thursday as an upper level ridge sits
over Western Washington. Residual moisture and light winds will
promote the development of patchy fog and low stratus Thursday
morning and should clear out by the afternoon giving way for some
partly cloudy skies. HREF guidance hints that the thickest fog
will likely form along South Puget Sound and the Chehalis Valley
(60-80% chance of 0.25 mi visibility or less). High temperatures
will be in the upper 40s to low 50s.

An upper level trough will move over Western Washington on Friday
bringing lowland rain, mountain snow, and breezy westerly winds.
Snow levels will bounce between 3000 to 4000 ft on Friday, leading
to a few inches of snow accumulation along Snoqualmie and Stevens
Pass. Model guidance hints at the possibility of a Puget Sound
Convergence Zone developing across the Central Cascades on Friday
afternoon, which may lead to higher localized amounts of
snowfall. Snow levels are expected to decrease below 3000 ft by
Friday night.

Precipitation is expected to continue into the weekend, with light
showers possible primarily along the mountain ranges.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Slight chance of showers
still remain possible early Sunday morning mostly along the
mountain ranges. Drier conditions are expected to ensue starting
late Sunday morning as an upper level ridge will build and
amplify over the Pacific Ocean, with broad ridging settling over
the Pacific Northwest by midweek. There is some disagreement in
the exact strength of the ridge; however most models favor a
moderate to strong ridge situated over the area by Wednesday. This
upper level pattern will likely bring a few rounds of morning
patchy fog to the region. High temperatures will be in the 40s and
gradually warm up to near 50 by midweek. Low temperatures will be
in the low to mid 30s.

The next chance of precipitation may come as early as Wednesday
night as some guidance brings PoPs back into the forecast.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will continue to build inland through
Thursday as it slowly drifts eastward. A ridge axis to the west will
track eastward, which will shut off north flow aloft over the
terminals later tonight into Thursday. Ceilings this afternoon have
improved to VFR for most main terminals (lower MVFR clouds with
pockets of IFR remain in the Kitsap Peninsula but have been
receding from north to south based on satellite). Cloud coverage
will scatter (except in the Olympics and Cascades). Winds through
the afternoon will remain light out of the north/northeast at 4 to 8
kt. Expect a decrease of winds tonight with weak gradients
increasing the chance of either low IFR/LIFR stratus of fog across
most of the terminals early Thursday morning (starting in the South
Interior around 10-12Z and spreading region-wide by 16-18Z). Once
the fog/stratus clears, VFR/few clouds are expected remainder of
Thursday. Winds will slowly switch back to the south later Friday
afternoon at 4 to 8 kt.

KSEA...VFR mostly overcast ceilings early this afternoon will
continue to scatter through the evening. Light north to northeast
winds at 4 to 8 kt. Expect light winds under 5 kt tonight into
Thursday (variable at times). IFR/LIFR probabilities are 30 and 20
percent respectively for the low stratus/fog potential Thursday
morning. Best timeframe for any IMC conditions will be from 15Z
through 20Z (descent chance it starts early and lingers longer).
Once fog/stratus clears, few clouds/VFR for the remainder of the day
with winds beginning to pick up out of the south at 4 to 8 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will continue to build inland today through
Thursday as it progresses inland (keeping flow primarily offshore
for most waterways). Morning fog is possible over portions of the
Puget Sound Waters Thursday morning. Low pressure to the west will
swing a frontal system Thursday night into Friday. This will be the
next best chance of gusty west winds over the coastal waters and the
Strait of Juan de Fuca. Most likely scenario is a windy period with
gusts up to 25 kt with the fronts that pass through (which will also
produce some precipitation). Once the system passes, it remains very
quiet with no wind headlines expected after this system in the
outlook period.

Seas today continue to drop to 6 to 8 feet. Expect an increase up to
10 to 14 feet Friday/Saturday, before dropping under 10 feet Sunday
and climbing back to 10 to 12 feet Sunday night into Monday briefly,
then holding at 8 to 10 feet through next week.
