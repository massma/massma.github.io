.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Chilly start to the day this morning with another round
of fog/low clouds across the interior. Widespread 30s are being
observed along with a few 20s. Abundant sunshine is present along
the coast but it is of course being met with crisp, winter air.
For today, more widespread clearing should be met as dry northerly
winds aloft help to mix things out. High temperatures will rise
to the lower to mid 40s. Can`t rule out a stray shower or two
across the CWA but mostly dry conditions are expected.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...High pressure at the surface and a strong ridge aloft
over the Pacific coast will dominate the weather into the middle of
next week, bringing dry conditions and colder temperatures.
Overnight lows are expected to fall below freezing over much of
Western Washington this weekend before temperatures gradually
recover by midweek.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...While not as widespread as 24
hours ago, fog once again is the most prominent weather feature this
early morning. While the usual suspects are reporting the usual
quarter-mile visibility, such as Olympia, Shelton and Chehalis,
there are some sites seeing dips ranging from 1 mile to 4 miles.
This distribution well exemplifies the descriptor patchy. The plus
side of the fog is that it is serving to keep temps from falling too
far, although obs from 2 AM still show a pretty wide distribution of
temps in the lower to mid 30s, even dipping into the upper 20s in
Bellingham and Port Townsend.

The upper level ridging responsible shows little inclination on
moving, at least throughout the short term, as the ridge axis stays
nearly stationary over the Pacific waters. This will help to dry
conditions out, restraining any additional fog development to late
tonight/early Saturday morning before eliminating it from the
forecast for the remainder of the near term period. Unfortunately,
these drier conditions will allow for overnight low temperatures to
dip even further this weekend with widespread sub-freezing
temperatures expected. Overnight lows tonight and Saturday night are
expected to be in the upper 20s to lower 30s. The coldest night is
expected to be Sunday night into Monday morning. Apparent
temperatures may sink below 25 degrees over portions of W WA both
Saturday night and Sunday night, which may end up warranting a Cold
Weather Advisory headline in some locations. These cold starts will
have an impact on daytime highs, with most locations only getting
into the lower 40s each day...with the exception of along the coast,
where mid 40s will be possible.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The ridge axis gradual shifting
eastward will finally bring it to the WA coast Monday morning, which
will initiate some flattening and starting a very incremental
warming trend. This will be aided by an infiltration of clouds
starting Monday night as an incoming front gradually approaches.
Models show this trough swinging through Tuesday...however
deterministic models show quite a gulf in their solutions. The GFS
keeps unsettled weather into Wednesday while the ECMWF not only
brings the trough through dry early Tuesday, but has yet another
ridge following close behind. Ensembles overall favoring what would
ultimately be a dry solution, however the range in PoPs starts to
grow from here and extending into the remainder of the forecast
period...peaking on Friday. It needs to be noted that the range in
solutions for Friday tops out with a PoP around 30 pct with a mean
nearly half that. Regardless, the NBM has latched on to this
uncertainty and has introduced PoPs, albeit weak ones, starting
Wednesday and carrying through the second half of the new week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge offshore will gradually build into
Western Washington today with northwest flow aloft continuing.
Persistent fog and low stratus remains in the Puget Sound region
southward through KCLS. As this gradually erodes away this morning,
we`ll see improving conditions into the afternoon with rising
heights and developing low level northerly flow drying out the air
mass. Clearing skies and light surface winds will allow for the
development of patchy LIFR fog/stratus tonight, especially across
south Puget Sound and the Southwest Interior.

KSEA...Fog will maintain LIFR ceiling/visibility for the next few
hours, but developing northerly surface wind and the building ridge
should bring improvement into the afternoon with VFR conditions
through evening. Developing pattern tonight favors keeping LIFR fog
out of the TAF for now with better chances for freezing fog south
and west of the terminal. Surface winds northerly increasing to
around 10 kt this afternoon.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Seas over the coastal waters continue to gradually
subside, so the advisory for the outer coastal waters has been
cancelled. Otherwise, a broad surface ridge over the coastal and
offshore waters will build inland this weekend with light offshore
flow developing and persisting into Monday. A weak system is
expected to dissipate offshore on Tuesday with offshore flow
increasing again thereafter as a strong surface ridge rebuilds over
the interior of British Columbia and east of the Cascades. Seas
remain below 10 feet through the week ahead.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
