Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
934 AM PDT Fri Oct 4 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A front continues to move east across Western
Washington through the day today. A convergence zone will form
behind the front over Snohomish County this afternoon, but later
dissipate this evening. High pressure returns to the region
tonight through the weekend, with warmer and dry conditions
expected. High pressure then shifts east on Monday, allowing for
additional weather systems to reach the area next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The cold front continues to
advance across the region, pushing east of the I-5 corridor late
this morning and into the Cascades. Behind the front, expect
showers to continue in the unstable post-frontal air mass into the
afternoon hours. A Puget Sound Convergence Zone is likely to form
over Snohomish County this afternoon, and there`s around a 20%
chance for an isolated thunderstorm within the PSCZ. Remainder of
previous short/long term sections remain valid and follow. Cullen

Post frontal shower activity drying up overnight as upper level
ridge begins to build into Western Washington. Convergence zone
dissipating in the evening. Low level flow becoming light early
Saturday morning. With the low level moisture from Friday`s rain
patchy fog developing in the fog prone areas like the Southwest
Interior. Lows in the 40s.

Upper level ridge continuing to build Saturday with the ridge
remaining over the area through the weekend. Ridge axis bouncing
back and forth between Western and Eastern Washington but the
ridge will keep storms out of the region. Patchy fog dissipating
Saturday morning with plenty of afternoon sunshine warming highs
in the lower to mid 60s. A little warmer Sunday with highs in the
60s.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement Monday with the upper level ridge shifting east. Some
differences in the models on just how intact and when the next
front arrives into the area. The ECMWF has a weak front moving
through Tuesday while the GFS solution keeps the front more intact
and delays the front into Wednesday. Ensemble solutions generally
agree with the operational runs making for a broad brush mostly
cloudy chance of rain forecast Tuesday and Wednesday. Model
solutions continue to diverge Thursday with the ECMWF building a
ridge over the area ahead of a digging upper level back near
40N/140W. The GFS has the trough a little closer to the coast and
keeps Western Washington in southwesterly flow aloft without a
ridge. While the operational runs are dry there are enough wet
solutions in the ensembles to have a slight chance of rain in the
forecast for Thursday.

Highs Monday in the lower 70s over the southern portion with 60s
for the remainder of the area. Highs a little cooler Tuesday
through Thursday, in the lower to mid 60s. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front will continue to pass through the region
this morning with a line of moderate rain moving through the
interior as of 15Z. This line is limiting visibility to MVFR while
ceilings largely remain VFR. Ceilings may briefly drop to MVFR with
the frontal passage but expecting a quick recovery to VFR with
ceilings becoming broken following the front. Scattered showers may
remain across the region this afternoon, with a convergence zone
expected to develop over southern Snohomish county. S/SW winds will
pick up this morning into this afternoon up to 10-15 kt, with gusts
up to 20 kt possible. Winds will ease tonight.

KSEA...Moderate rain over the terminal with low-VFR ceilings as the
front passes as of 15Z. Ceilings may briefly drop to MVFR but
ceilings should rise to VFR and break up behind the frontal passage
(around 20Z). Convergence zone should remain to the north of the
area, though a few scattered showers behind the front are possible.
S/SW winds will pick up this afternoon up to 10-15 kt, gusts to 20
kt possible. VFR conditions remain through the early evening with
winds easing as well.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front is currently passing through the coastal
waters this morning with isolated showers behind the front. Winds
behind the front will shift to westerly but should ease up into
tonight and remain relatively inconsequential. A push of westerlies
through the Strait of Juan de Fuca is expected, where a Small Craft
Advisory remains in effect from this afternoon through tonight. The
strongest winds are expected through the Central Strait. Winds will
ease tonight. High pressure will build into the area from the
southwest through the weekend with the next frontal system moving
into the area early next week.

Seas are expected to build up to 9 to 11 feet this afternoon. The
steepest seas will be in the northern and central outer coastal
zones. A Small Craft Advisory remains in effect through tonight.
Seas will drop to 4 to 6 ft this weekend, before coming back up to 7
to 9 ft early next week and waves generated from a low pressure
system in the north central Pacific arrives to the region.
