Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
747 PM PDT Sat Oct 26 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Another front will produce widespread rain and breezy
conditions again tonight into Sunday. Unstable conditions will
allow for a chance of thunderstorms on Sunday and snow levels will
fall low enough for mountain snow. A brief break is possible late
Monday and Tuesday before another system looks to bring another
round of rain and mountain snow mid-week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Rain continues to fall across the region this evening as
a frontal system moves through. The heaviest of the rain will push
through areas overnight, with everything scaling back to showers.
Please see discussion below for further details.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Scattered showers
continue across Western Washington as the region lies between a pair
of fronts. The next system will spread rain onshore this evening
into Sunday morning before a showery, cooler post-frontal air mass
follows Sunday afternoon into Sunday night with a slight chance of
thunder mainly west of Puget Sound. It`ll become breezy to locally
windy with and behind tonight`s front, but overall winds will be
lighter than the previous system. The trailing upper trough will
move onshore Sunday night with snow levels falling to the higher
passes. Mount Baker should tally several inches of snow from this
system, but light accumulation at best is expected for the higher
passes through the Cascades from Snohomish County southward. Showers
remain in the forecast on Monday with an upper trough axis overhead,
but conditions should begin to dry out Monday night as the upper
trough shifts eastward and weak upper ridging noses into the area.
Tuesday is shaping up to be the driest of the next few days as weak
shortwave ridging slides across the area. Rain ahead of a next
approaching front is slated to reach coastal areas by late Tuesday
night.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Another upper trough
and associated front is expected to shift southeastward into the
area on Wednesday. There are some model differences with the track
of the system, but ensembles generally agree that it will be a
relatively cool system with snow levels falling to 3000 to 3500
feet by Thursday morning. Broad upper troughing remains over the
area into Friday for a continuation of cool, wet conditions and
additional snowfall in the mountain passes. Looking further ahead,
ensemble heights anomalies are trending positive upstream over
the northeast Pacific toward the end of the week as broad upper
troughing is carved out over the Intermountain West. If this
holds, we could be talking about a (mostly) dry first weekend of
November. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft will persist through the TAF
period as a deep upper level low sinks southward over the NE
Pacific. Conditions will generally remain VFR to MVFR across the
region. Another round another round of more widespread rain moves
inland tonight with lowering ceilings, restricted visibility in
rain, and a return of gusty winds. The air mass will be slightly
unstable on Sunday with a chance of thunderstorms along the coast.

KSEA...Scattered showers with predominant ceilings around 4000
ft, though briefly lowering possible in heavier showers. Expect
southerly winds to again increase overnight with gusts to 25 kt
and steadier rain which likely brings MVFR ceilings and reduced
visibility. Winds begin to ease after daybreak Sunday but remain
gusty through the day.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Winds are again increasing this evening ahead of the
next front. Seas peaked around 17-20 ft this morning over the
coastal waters and will gradually subside through the day today.
Another increase to a similar range is expected again on Sunday.

The front on Sunday will likely bring another round of breezy winds
for the coast and north interior waters. The pattern will remain
active heading into next week as a strong low moves from the Gulf of
Alaska southward toward the region Monday before pushing onshore
into Oregon by Tuesday. High pressure then returns over the waters
Tuesday, but the next front quickly arrives into Wednesday. This
will maintain seas over the coastal waters generally above 10 ft
through much of the week, though a brief lull is possible early
Tuesday with the brief return of higher pressure.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
