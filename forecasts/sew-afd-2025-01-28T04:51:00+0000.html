Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
851 PM PST Mon Jan 27 2025

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows clear skies over Western
Washington this evening. The combination of clear skies and light
winds has allowed temperatures to already drop below freezing in
many locations.

Upper level ridge remaining in place through Wednesday for
another two days of clear skies, cool nights and sunny days.
Ridge breaking down Wednesday night into Thursday allowing the
first organized front in days to move through Western Washington
Thursday night into Friday. Current forecast on track. No update
tonight. Previous discussion follows. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...Chilly but dry conditions will persist through mid-
week. After a long dry spell, a wetter and slightly warmer system
will impact the region late Thursday through Friday bringing a
return of lowland rain and mountain snow. Cooler conditions are
favored to gradually return Saturday into next week and combined
with light precipitation could bring a change from rain to snow
to the western Washington lowlands.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...Persistent upper level
ridging will allow dry, quiet, and chilly conditions to continue
through early Thursday. Apparent temperatures are expected to
remain just above Cold Weather Advisory criteria this week. The
only other concern is the continuation of stagnant conditions.
However, with AQ sensors primarily reaching the moderate category
we will continue to hold off on the coordination of any AQ
products for now.

By late Thursday, an approaching system will result in increasing
cloud cover, limiting cooling, while also beginning to spread
precipitation across the region in the form of lowland rain and
mountain snow.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Lowland rain and mountain
snow associated with the system arriving Thursday night will
continue through Friday. The main concern during this time frame
will be the intensity of the mountain snowfall as well as rain on
roadways that have been abnormally dry for this time of year,
potentially leading to slick conditions.

The forecast grows increasingly interesting Saturday and beyond.
There is decent agreement in an extremely positively tilted
longwave trough stalling somewhere in the PNW and remaining nearly
stationary for several days. This pattern has been known to drag
cooler air out of Canada, out over the far eastern Pacific
potentially picking up addition moisture, then returning back into
the region in the form of wintry precipitation. This can also
bring Fraser River outflow winds across western Whatcom and San
Juan counties and result in upslope flow along the northern
Olympic Peninsula.

However, the details of this pattern matter and based on the
latest cluster analysis there is a wide range of possible
scenarios beginning Saturday and continuing next week. These
differences will have a significant impact on the temperatures as
well as the timing, location, extent of any winter precipitation.
As such, for the moment we are focused on the broad scale
probabilities of snowfall and potential issues we could
experience. In general, expect areas of lowland rainfall from
Friday to linger into Saturday. Temperatures may cool enough
Saturday to allow for a transition from rain to a rain-snow mix
and eventually snow by Saturday night. By Sunday into next week,
confidence is low in any details, but the overall trend is for
even cooler temperatures and an increasing risk of snow. That
said, the vast majority of solutions keep snowfall accumulations
light. Broadly speaking, in the rolling 24 hour windows this
weekend into early next week there is up to a 60-70% chance of
measurable snowfall, a 35-40% chance of 1" of snowfall, a 15-35%
chance of 2" of snowfall, and a 0-15% chance of 4" of snowfall.
Critically though, these probabilities don`t change much over next
week. This is in part because many of the ensemble members have
quite cold temperatures lingering through much of next week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>North/northwesterly flow aloft as ridging continues
over the region, with offshore flow in the lower levels. VFR across
all of the terminals this evening with not a cloud in sight. N/NE
winds around 4 to 8 knots will gradually lighten into the overnight
period. Fog development tonight generally in the usual sites such as
KPWT and KOLM, with IFR/LIFR conditions into Tuesday morning.

KSEA...VFR this evening with light N/NE winds will continue into the
overnight period. Latest guidance shows around a 25% chance of
lowered conditions (IFR/LIFR) due to fog development, but confidence
is low that fog will reach the terminal. Otherwise, VFR should
persist.

.MARINE...A surface high pressure continues over the offshore
waters for generally calm and benign marine conditions. The
aforementioned high pressure will gradually weaken into Wednesday
a with a front moving over the waters into Thursday. Increasing
winds over the coastal waters may lead to a Small Craft Advisory
Thursday into Friday.

Combined seas generally 3 to 5 feet through midweek, rising to
around 6 to 8 feet by the end of the week and into the weekend as
a more active weather pattern approaches.

.HYDROLOGY...No river flooding is expected over the next 7 days as
abnormally dry conditions continue. However, with the precipitation
coming towards the end of the week, the Skokomish River is forecast
to rise substantially above Action Stage. There will be much
uncertainty with the river forecast all the way into the event
given the current below normal flows and the snow and ice build up
in the basin over this recent dry but cold period. As far as
other rivers, only low elevation basins like the Chehalis,
Samish, and Stillaguamish Rivers will see much response at all.

.CLIMATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The record dry spell in Seattle in January is 15 days,
January 16-30, 1963. Counting today the current streak is at 11
days. Two 12 day streaks are tied for the second longest,
January 19-30, 1945 and January 11-22, 2013. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
