Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
845 AM PST Sat Jan 11 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Continuing showers in a Puget Sound Convergence Zone are
expected to linger into the afternoon, but otherwise quiet
conditions over Western Washington as high pressure begins to build
over the region. A few showers will still be possible at times this
weekend, especially in the mountains and near the coast. This strong
ridge will continue building in next week, bringing mostly dry
conditions and developing morning fog each day.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The little PSCZ that could is
still hanging on over portions of central and eastern Snohomish
county this morning...but otherwise, no significant radar activity
at the time of this writing. This will allow for some continued
light snow showers or flurries in the Central Cascades, but amounts
will fall short of what has been seen over the past 24 hours.
Otherwise, the only weather of note are some low clouds and patchy
fog primarily situated along or near the south and eastern Sound.

Short term model output remaining pretty consistent with past runs,
yielding a nearly unchanged forecast. Upper level ridging over the
Pacific will continue to move slowly eastward, however lingering
moisture today and a weak shortwave along the leading edge of the
ridge Sunday will keep PoPs in the forecast...even though they will
be quite trivial /10-30 pct at best/ and mostly focused either along
the coast or in the Cascades. The primary weather concern will be
developing patchy fog during the overnight and early morning hours
each day and attempting to time when it will lift...and the usual 10
AM to noon window serves as a good starting point, although latest
hi-res guidance and ensembles may prove helpful in shifting this
timing either forward or back.

Daytime highs will be on a bit of a cooling trend, starting off in
the mid to upper 40s today, then sinking into the lower to mid 40s
for both Sunday and Monday. Overnight lows follow a similar trend as
the ridge aloft will help to clear skies out and foster radiative
cooling, with lows tonight in the mid to upper 30s, then falling to
the lower to mid 30s Sunday night.

Inherited forecast is on track with no need for morning updates.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...From Previous
Discussion...High pressure remains firmly in place across the
western U.S. for the start of next week, and perhaps longer.
Ensemble guidance does suggest at least some potential for an upper
low tracking eastward to perhaps be close enough across British
Columbia to at least flatten the ridge and at least bring some
renewed precipitation chances across the region. Overnight
temperatures remain rather cool through the week, mostly in the
lower 30s with a few upper 20s in the coolest spots. Daytime highs
will remain in the 40s, with some increasing cloud cover later in
the week due to the previously mentioned disturbance to the north.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper ridge will continue to build offshore today
with north-northwesterly flow aloft. Variable cigs this morning
across Western Washington with continued moisture at the surface and
a few showers Snohomish County northward. Generally VFR/MVFR cigs
for the coast, Southwest Interior, and Snohomish County northward,
with MVFR/IFR cigs around central Puget Sound and patchy fog near
PWT. MVFR and brief periods of IFR will continue through this
morning for central Puget Sound with MVFR/VFR elsewhere into the
early afternoon. Some improvements expected by mid-late afternoon to
more widespread VFR cigs, with some remaining MVFR cigs. Cigs will
lower again tonight into Sunday morning, with areas of vsby
reduction. Generally light winds.

KSEA...MVFR cigs into the early afternoon with times of IFR through
approximately 19z. Some improvements to VFR possible by mid to late
afternoon before cigs lower later tonight into Sunday morning
towards IFR and times of LIFR. Light south to southeast winds. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will build over the area today
through Monday. The ridge will remain over the waters through the
end of next week.

Small craft advisory westerly winds in the Central and Eastern
Strait of Juan de Fuca will ease late morning. Small craft advisory
winds over the outer coastal waters will ease late this afternoon.
No small craft advisory winds expected for the remainder of the
week.

Seas 12 to 15 feet today subsiding to 10 to 12 feet tonight. Seas
remaining near 10 feet over the Northern and Central Outer coastal
waters into MOnday while seas fall just below 10 feet over the
remainder of the coastal waters. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
