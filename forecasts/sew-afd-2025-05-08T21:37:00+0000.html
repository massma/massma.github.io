Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
237 PM PDT Thu May 8 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Dry and relatively warm weather will linger into
Friday. The pattern will begin to shift late Friday setting the
stage for a cooler, showery pattern for much of the weekend. A
more organized frontal system looks to bring more widespread
- even stratiform rain later Sunday into Monday. The pattern
next week may be dominated by an offshore ridge, and cooler
Spring like weather.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridging
settling into the area with dry and warm conditions coming along
with it into Friday. High temperatures into Friday will reach to
near 70 for many locations through the interior from King
County Southward, and low to mid 60s elsewhere. The pattern will
begin to shift Saturday with the upper level ridge starting to
nudges eastward, ahead of an approaching upper level trough.
This will set the stage for a cooler, showery pattern Saturday
with highs in the 50s to the mid 60s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The offshore upper level
trough low is expected to shift more fully Sunday - ensembles
vary a bit on the track and strength with some taking a more
direct westward track, while others a more southeasterly path
into Oregon. Either way Sunday looks to see more widespread
shower activity - and a slight chance of thunderstorms
later in the afternoon and evening. Grand ensembles generally
agree on the upper level trough lingering over the Pacific
Northwest into Monday before gradually shifting east into Monday
night. This will most likely keep Monday cooler and showery.
The grand ensemble continues to show some degree of offshore
ridging becoming established Tuesday into midweek which would
keep the Pacific Northwest under northerly flow aloft with some
chance of showers possible - and slightly cooler than normal
temperatures at least into midweek.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West to southwest flow aloft as an upper level ridge
builds over our area with an approaching trough offshore. VFR at
all terminals this afternoon with some high clouds around. Low
level flow will turn northerly this afternoon, with mostly north
winds across area terminals ranging from 8 to 12 knots. VFR looks
to continue into Friday morning with winds easing up.

KSEA...VFR this afternoon will continue throughout the TAF period.
Northerly winds 8 to 12 knots this afternoon will start to ease
after 06z. Light N/NE winds into Friday morning.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure over the coastal waters will lead
to generally benign marine conditions through Friday. A series of
weak systems will cross over the waters over the weekend and into
early next week, resulting in periodic increases in onshore flow
over the area waters. Possible headlines over the weekend could
include pushes down the Strait of Juan De Fuca, but not confident
at this time.

Coastal seas 4 to 6 feet into the weekend and into the early half
of next week.
