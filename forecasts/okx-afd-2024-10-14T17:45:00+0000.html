Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
145 PM EDT Mon Oct 14 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front continues moving through this afternoon. High
pressure then slowly builds through mid week, and settles over
the area Friday into this weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Initial cold front continues to push offshore and will be
followed by a secondary front/surface trough late afternoon and
evening.

Gusts 25-35 mph are possible into the evening. Winds will shift
to the NW behind the secondary boundary and would not be
surprised to see a few peak gusts in the 35 to 40 mph range.

Highs will range from the upper 50s to upper 60s. Should see
temperatures begin to fall behind the secondary boundary late
afternoon/early evening.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
Dry conditions through the rest of the short term as high
pressure remains west of the region, settling over the center
of the country by Wednesday afternoon, and shifting east
Wednesday night. Cut off low treks into northern New England and
southeastern Canada tonight remains nearly stationary through
Tuesday night, then slowly tracks northeast Wednesday through
Wednesday night. High amplitude positively tilted trough moves
in Tuesday night into Wednesday morning over the Eastern
seaboard with the trough axis moving offshore by Wednesday
night.

With the closed low over northern New England and southeastern
Canada, cold advection will continue through Wednesday, with
some of the coldest air of the fall season thus far. Lows
tonight range from the lower 30s in the interior to the lower to
middle 40s across the coastal region. Mixed low levels tonight
will keep temperatures from fully bottoming out and will
preclude frost formation.

Highs on Tuesday and Wednesday will be hard pressed to climb
above the 50s, especially on Wednesday. Winds remain a bit
elevated on Tuesday night, which still may limit frost
formation. Better chances for frost Wednesday night across
northeast New Jersey, the Lower Hudson Valley, and inland
southern Connecticut as the center of the high begins to move in
and temperatures are expected to be at their lowest for the
week. Lower 30s (with some isolated areas dipping below freezing
well inland) are expected across the northern portions of the
Lower Hudson Valley. Middle 30s are expected across portions of
northeast New Jersey and inland Connecticut, while coastal area
dip to lower 40s.

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
There have been no major changes to the forecast mid week
through the end of the week.

Key Points:

* A warming trend begins Friday with temperatures returning to normal,
  then potentially above normal next weekend.

* No precipitation is expected.

The trough axis will slowly push offshore by Thursday taking
with it any surface cyclogenesis. The trough pushes further out
over the Atlantic Friday into next weekend as a large ridge and
positive 500 mb height anomalies builds over the east. This will
allow the surface high over the central states mid week to
build overhead and remain in control Friday into next weekend.

Highs will begin moderating Thursday and return to normal
Friday in the 60s before approaching 70 degrees next weekend.
Lows Tuesday night, Wednesday night, and Thursday night look to
fall into the low to mid 30s inland and 40s for coastal/metro
areas. This will bring the potential for frost inland,
especially where winds weaken or become light Wednesday night
and Thursday night.

.AVIATION /18Z MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure continues to track along the New England coast this
afternoon, and into the Canadian Maritime this evening,
bringing a secondary cold front across the terminals late this
afternoon into early this evening.

VFR, except IFR at KGON, improving to VFR by 20Z. A gusty west
wind continues becoming NW with the passage of a secondary cold
front 22Z/23Z. Gusts may occasionally peak at 35 kt this
afternoon. Winds and gusts diminish through the evening, with
gusts ending late tonight. Northwest gusts redevelop Tuesday
morning, 20-25 kt.


 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

No unscheduled amendments expected.


OUTLOOK FOR 18Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday: VFR. W-NW winds 10-15G20-25kt.

Thursday through Saturday: VFR.

forecasts, can be found at: https:/www.weather.gov/zny/n90<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...
Gusts over 25 kt expected on all waters today behind a cold
front. Winds gradually subside tonight. In response, ocean
seas build to 5-8 ft, before gradually subsiding tonight into
early Tuesday morning. The SCA on the ocean was therefore
extended until 8 am Tuesday.

Sub-SCA conditions expected Tuesday through Wednesday night and
should remain below SCA levels Thursday into Friday with high
pressure building over the waters. Ocean seas are expected to
remain below 5 ft.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Because there was such little rainfall with the passing frontal
system, and Keetch Byram indices are over 300 for much if not
all of the forecast area (indicating overall dry conditions),
and it will breezy today, there are some minor concerns for fire
weather mainly across Long Island where minimum RH values should
dip below 40 percent this afternoon. However, this may only be
for a short time frame as temperatures begin to drop this
afternoon on strong cold air advection.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
There are no hydrologic concerns attm.
