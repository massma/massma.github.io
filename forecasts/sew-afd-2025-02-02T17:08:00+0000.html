Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
908 AM PST Sun Feb 2 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Cold upper level trough remaining over Western
Washington through the week. Much below normal temperatures with
snow showers at times decreasing in the middle of the week. Fraser
River outflow winds beginning later tonight continuing through at
least Wednesday.

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Snow showers are continuing to move across all of
western Washington this morning. Some of the snow showers have
been able to produce sticking/accumulating snow (especially west
of Puget Sound). The temperatures this morning are in the low 30s
region-wide. With only a slight warm up into the upper 30s (maybe
a few low 40s in places close to water), the precipitation may
remain primarily snow (with only a rain/snow mix in warmer areas).
Some graupel/thunder is possible with some of the showers today
too. Additionally, Fraser River outflow is expected to dip wind
chills into the single digits and teens for western Whatcom and
San Juan Counties. A cold weather advisory was issued for these
areas in the morning update. For additional forecast details,
please see the discussion below.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
cold upper level trough over the area with tons of cold cumulus
along the coast extending well offshore. Doppler radar has showers
along the coast and with temperatures near freezing precipitation
type with these showers is snow. Much less shower activity over
the interior with the air mass stabilizing a little overnight. A
little break in the cloud cover has allowed freezing fog to form
in the Southern Puget Sound and Hood Canal area. Temperatures at 3
am/11z were in the upper 20s to mid 30s.

Little change to the forecast today with the cold air mass
overhead and low level onshore flow. A weak vort max moving
through the North Coast early this morning will drop a couple of
inches of snow. This feature will dissipate over the Strait of
Juan de Fuca. West southwesterly flow aloft will continue to
direct showers over Western Washington. Showers mostly in the
form of snow with some rain showers mixing in this afternoon. With
the flow aloft there is a bit of a snow shadow from about Seattle
to Everett this morning. This will fill in midday. Shower
activity increasing this afternoon over the interior with a little
daytime heating destabilizing the air mass. Like yesterday there
could be a one hit wonder lightning strike over the interior or an
ice pellet shower. Chances for thunder and ice pellets higher
along the coast. High temperatures today near 40. Snow showers
this morning could produce an inch of snow. The warmer
temperatures this afternoon will not eliminate the chances for
snow showers but the snow that does fall will not last very long.
There is some moisture on the surface early this morning which
could make for slick roads, especially the less traveled roads,
until mid to late morning when temperatures warm up.

Changes to the low level pattern tonight with Fraser River
outflow winds finally breaking through into Whatcom county as the
low level flow turns offshore. Bellingham to Williams Lake
gradient bottoming out around -20 mb but models continue to show
most of the colder air bottled up over British Columbia keeping
the outflow winds below wind advisory criteria. Showers overnight
will be in the form of snow but like we saw Saturday night shower
activity will decrease over the interior as the air mass
stabilizes a little with the end of the daytime "heating". Best
chances for more than an inch of accumulation along the North
Coast and over the Northwest Interior with another weak upper
level feature moving through overnight. Any shower activity over
the area could drop a quick inch of snow. Lows mostly in the mid
to upper 20s except lower 20s Whatcom county.

Little change in the pattern Monday through Tuesday. Upper level
trough slowly digging southwest offshore. Low level flow
remaining offshore. As the trough continues to dig southwest it
will pull some but not all of the shower activity away from at the
least the interior of Western Washington. Air mass remaining cold
enough that the showers will be in the form of snow. Once again
accumulations will be hit or miss. Heavier showers could drop a
quick couple of inches while most of the showers will produce an
inch or less of snow. Some locations will not see any shower
activity. Highs both days in the mid to upper 30s. Enough cloud
cover to keep lows mostly in the 20s. Could see a slight increase
in the Fraser River outflow winds over Whatcom county but at this
point winds still look to be below advisory criteria.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...General agreement in
the extended models with the cold upper level trough remaining
over the area through Friday. Some differences on how far south
and west the trough digs offshore. Operational GFS and ECMWF have
the jet stream moving into Northern and Central California by
Thursday leaving Western Washington under a broad but by this
stage of the game weak upper level trough. Shower activity drying
up Thursday into Friday. The GFS ensemble solutions are trending
drier for Thursday and Friday but still have enough solutions with
light precipitation to keep chance pops in the forecast. The
ECMWF has a few more wet solutions than the GFS but with the jet
so far to the south can`t go any higher than chance pops. Air mass
will still be cold enough for the showers to be in the form of
snow. Good agreement with the trough kicking east Friday night
into Saturday and the flow aloft turning northwesterly. Models
hinting at weak system embedded in the northwesterly flow
Saturday. Air mass over the area moderating a little but low snow
levels will continue into Saturday. End result of all this is a
continuation of the broadbrush mostly cloudy chance of snow
showers forecast through the period. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper trough axis offshore this morning will move
onshore over Western Washington late this afternoon and evening
with southwest flow aloft becoming westerly. Light flow near the
surface will become increasingly offshore tonight into Monday.
Ceilings will be a mixed bag this morning with scattered snow
showers producing areas of MVFR or IFR ceilings and occasional
reduced surface visibility of 1-3SM. Shower coverage will increase
late morning into this afternoon with the arrival of the upper
trough axis for areas of MVFR with a mix of rain and snow showers.

KSEA...Snow showers in the vicinity through 18-20z with a
rain/snow mix this afternoon. Shower activity is expected to
dwindle somewhat tonight, but surface temperatures will be cold
enough for possible light accumulation of an inch of less. Surface
winds southerly 7 to 10 knots easing to 6 knots or less this
evening. 33/27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak surface trough will remain over the coastal
waters into Monday. Strong surface ridging over the interior
of British Columbia will lead to the development of general offshore
flow and Fraser River outflow winds late tonight into Monday.
Troughing remains in place over the coastal and offshore waters with
a strong surface ridge over interior British Columbia through at
least midweek for a continuation of offshore flow. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...No river flooding in the next 7 days.
