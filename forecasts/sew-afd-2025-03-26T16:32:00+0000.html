Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
932 AM PDT Wed Mar 26 2025

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Just a quick update this morning. Things tracking well
right now for convective outbreak later this afternoon into the
evening hours. Weak vort max rippling through this morning
brought a few lightning strikes over the Kitsap Peninsula. Models
were right on top of this feature. Still have low clouds and fog
in the Central and Southern Puget Sound. Few breaks in the low
clouds at 9 am showing the accas clouds above us right now. Great
indicator that the air mass is unstable above the surface. The
more we warm up today the more fuel the thunderstorms will have
later this afternoon into this evening. Timing for the possible
severe thunderstorms still looking like starting around 3 to 4 pm
in Lewis county. The storms will be moving quickly and will reach
the metro area around 6 pm give or take an hour finally getting to
Bellingham around 9 to 10 pm. Everything is still in place for the
possibility of severe storms ( hail greater than 1 inch in size
and or wind gusts 58 mph or greater ). Something to remember the
frequency of lightning is not a factor on whether a storm is
severe. The models are starting to show the storms could become
organized into a QLCS ( a ragged long squall line ) instead of
isolated hit or miss storms.

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong storm system will lift a front across
western Washington on Wednesday, bringing in a chance for
widespread thunderstorms with severe thunderstorms possible. A
cold front Thursday will bring cooler temperatures while
maintaining unsettled conditions. Active weather is favored to
continue through the period with near-normal temperatures.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The main story today is the
potential for severe thunderstorms across western WA this
afternoon and evening with a warm, moist and unstable air mass
over the region. We`re under strong, diffluent flow with a
deep/stacked system rotating offshore. Per the HREF model,
showers/thunderstorms will initiate over western OR around 1-2pm
then spread northward into western WA through the rest of the
afternoon and evening (as a cold front moves in). Timing for the
Seattle metro area is around 5-7 pm. Steep lapse rates and mean
CAPE values exceeding 1,000 J/kg support strong updrafts across
the area with supercells expected. The Storm Prediction Center
has a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms west of the Cascades.
The main threats include large hail (up to 2" in diameter),
damaging wind (58 mph or greater) and (to a lesser extent) brief
tornadoes. Other threats include cloud-to-ground lightning and
brief heavy downpours. Severe weather threats start to diminish
this evening (after 9 pm) as a shortwave ejects north into B.C.
All in all, a very active day anticipated with multiple weather
threats not too common for the NW.

The upper low continues to spin offshore on Thursday, keeping the
weather showery across western WA. There is still a threat of
thunderstorms across the area but we`re not expecting severe
thunderstorm development. It`ll be breezy along the coast and
north interior with S/SE gusts to 30-40 mph.

Friday will be cooler (back to normal) as the upper low nudges
inland. The air mass remains moist with additional showers
expected. 33

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Upper level troughing
over the Pac NW will maintain showers as we move toward the end of
the week. Temperatures will be back to our seasonal averages with
highs in the lower to mid 50s. A weak ridge brings a short break
in the weather moving into Sunday. More wet and windy weather is
headed our way next week as low pressure shifts inland. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft turning southerly as a low
pressure system approaches western Washington. A mix of conditions
ranging from VFR to IFR/LIFR (due to fog along Puget Sound
terminals) this morning. Lowered conditions will continue through
the morning hours before gradually improving to VFR as a cold front
approaches the region, mixing out the fog.

As this front crosses over western Washington, models continue to
remain consistent in thunderstorm activity (coming from the south)
Wednesday afternoon and evening (23z-04z). Within these
thunderstorms and showers, conditions will likely drop to widespread
MVFR, with the potential for brief IFR in heavier rain showers and
lower visibilities. The main threats with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, gusty and erratic winds, hail, and brief periods
of heavy rain for much of the area. During these threats, conditions
can dramatically change, from VFR, to IFR quickly.

Showers will remain through the overnight period, but conditions
should balance out at VFR through Thursday morning.

KSEA...Currently IFR conditions due to fog. Conditions will improve
to VFR later this morning into the afternoon, before thunderstorms
start to develop across the area.

The main time frame where thunderstorm activity will peak at the
terminal is 00z-04z. The main threats will be hail, gusty erratic
winds, frequent lightning, and heavy downpours at times. Within
these conditions, conditions can and will likely fluctuate from
VFR/MVFR/IFR during the aforementioned time period. VFR will resume
late tonight into Thursday morning.

Outside of thunderstorms, winds will turn southerly and remain 5 to
10 knots.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure has shifted inland this morning
making room for an incoming low pressure system offshore and a
strong cold front associated with it. An inversion this morning
could produce fog over the inland waters, decreasing visibilities
down to 1SM. A cold front will push through the waters this
evening into Thursday morning. Behind the front, southerly winds
will increase over the coastal waters. Initially the strength of
these winds will be at small craft (20 to 30 kts), then
consistently strengthen to gale by Thursday afternoon. Most of the
gale strength will come with the gusts, with guidance suggesting
a 60-70% chance of frequent 35 to 40 kt winds across the coastal
waters through Thursday evening. Elsewhere, can expect small
craft advisory strength winds over the interior waters (Eastern
Strait, Admiralty Inlet, Northern Interior).

Coastal seas through tonight generally remaining 6 to 8 feet,
slowly building upwards to 15 to 20 feet possible by late
Thursday. Seas will begin to subside through Friday, decreasing
to below 10 feet by Saturday.

Active weather will continue the end of the weekend into the first
half of next week, where additional systems look to bring another
round of elevated winds and seas.

.HYDROLOGY...A storm system Wednesday will bring showers and
thunderstorms to the region, with potential for locally heavy
rainfall at times in stronger activity. However, due to the
convective and spotty nature of this precipitation, most area
rivers are expected to stay below Flood Stage. Precipitation will
continue throughout the week as active weather continues, but is
not expected to cause significant rises to area rivers.

The exception is the Skokomish River, where heavy showers mid-
week are favored to bring the Skokomish into Flood Stage by late
Thursday where it will likely remain through early Saturday. The
latest forecast has the river peaking into Moderate Flood Stage,
but large uncertainty exists over the amount of precipitation over
the basin. Conditions will continue to be closely monitored.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
