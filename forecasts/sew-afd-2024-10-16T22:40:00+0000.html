Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
340 PM PDT Wed Oct 16 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Unsettled weather and cooler temperatures are expected
through Thursday afternoon as several systems will bring the
chance for precipitation, breezy winds, and isolated
thunderstorms. A small break in precipitation is expected Thursday
night until an atmospheric river arrives this weekend bringing
moderate to heavy rain to the area. A high pressure developing
over the area on Monday will bring a break from precipitation for
the next couple days.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A deep upper level
trough continues to slowly push eastward bringing cooler
temperatures and precipitation to the region through Thursday
afternoon. Earlier today a cold front moved through the area
bringing some rain during the morning hours. Current satellite and
radar show a breaking in cloud cover and a few isolated lighting
strikes off the coast. Colder air behind the cold front will
allow for the destabilization of the atmosphere and promote some
isolated convection this afternoon and into the late evening hours.
Models also favor the development of a Puget Convergence Zone
this afternoon which can lead to some localized heavier
precipitation amounts. Chances for thunderstorms are 10-20%, with
the highest chances along the coast and convergence zone. Rain is
expected to transition into snow going into Thursday morning as
snow levels are forecasted to gradually decrease down to 3500 ft
in in some locations. Light snowfall accumulations are possible
with 1-3 inches over the higher mountain passes, such as Stevens
Pass and Rainy Pass.

The upper level trough is expected to push out Thursday night.
Surface high pressure begins to build bringing a small break from
precipitation on Friday before an atmospheric river moves into
the region this weekend. Expect a small rebound in temperatures,
with temperatures in the upper 50s and lower 60s.

Model guidance shows an atmospheric river moving into the region
this weekend bringing significant rainfall to the region. There
is some uncertainty on the location and timing of the event. Some
of the models have the system staying further north in B.C. on
Friday and Saturday, limiting precipitation chances in the region
to the north coast of Washington. However, there is a general
agreement between models that the highest precipitation amounts
for this event will likely be concentrated along the northwest
coast and the Olympic Mountains with 3-6 inches possible. Along
the Cascades 2-3 inches are possible, while the lowlands are
forecasted to receive 0.5-1.5 inches. Gusty winds are also
forecasted with this event particularly along the north coast with
gusts maxing up to 30-40 mph, and 20-35 mph gusts over the
central and north interior.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...The atmospheric river will
finally begin to move southward on Sunday bringing precipitation
to much of the region. Breezy conditions are still expected with
gusts reaching 25-30 mph. The rain is expected to start to taper
off on Sunday afternoon and some light remnant shower activity is
possible on Monday. Model guidance hints at an area of surface
high pressure developing on Monday and building over the next
couple of days over the region. This will bring some relief from
precipitation for the next few days with high temperatures in the
50s.

.HYDROLOGY...As fall-like weather settles into the region, a
series of frontal systems will bring periods of rainfall to
western Washington throughout the week and into the weekend. There
is a signal of an atmospheric river pattern developing this
weekend that could bring in moderate to heavy rainfall at times,
though the exact timing and placement of this storm system still
remains uncertain. Precipitation amounts will continue to be
monitored closely over the next few days to determine if there is
a risk of elevated river flows. At this time, area rivers are not
currently forecast to rise into action stage or reach minor flood
stage.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly to westerly flow aloft will turn more
northwesterly overnight into Thursday as an upper level trough
moves through the area. Low level onshore flow will continue
across the region into Thursday.

Radar shows shower and isolated thunderstorm activity moving
inland along the coast this afternoon. Current conditions are
mostly widespread VFR across the interior terminals this afternoon,
with IFR conditions along the coast for terminals in showers.
Shower activity will continue into Thursday as a weak system moves
through the region. Isolated thunderstorms will remain possible
as well at times into Thursday. Widespread VFR ceilings look to
continue through tonight, except for brief reductions to MVFR/
IFR in any heavier shower activity. Gusty southwesterly winds to
20 kts will ease towards 4-7 kts late tonight into Thursday.
Ceilings look to lower back down to MVFR between 09-12Z.

KSEA...VFR ceilings with southwesterly winds 8-12 kts, gusting to
20 kts at times this afternoon. Winds easing to 4-8 knots tonight
into Thursday, generally between 06-09Z. Showers will be possible
at times and may briefly reduce ceilings and visibilities. MVFR
ceilings look to redevelop by 12Z Thursday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Multiple systems will move through the area waters in
the next few days. Winds generally persisting between 10-20 kt
this afternoon with seas currently hovering around 6-8 ft.
Northwesterly winds will increase to 20-25 kt across the outer
coastal waters and seas look to build to 10 to 11 ft across the
coastal waters with a weak system moving across the area on
Thursday. A warm front moving into the northern portion of the
waters Friday into Friday night could produce gale force winds
over portions of the coastal waters and over the Northern Inland
waters and the East Entrance of the Strait of Juan de Fuca Friday
night into Saturday. The warm front will stall and weaken Saturday.
The trailing cold front will not arrive until Sunday night, with
possible small craft advisory winds over the coastal waters.

Seas will subside Thursday night into Friday before rebuilding
into the 10 to 12 foot range for most of the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
