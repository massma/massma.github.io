.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The compact low pressure system continues to bring rain,
winds, mountain snow across Western Washington this morning. 15z
sfc analysis from WPC places the 986mb low near Sequim, with a
continued NE track into the afternoon. This allowed for the
majority of the strongest winds over the last 12 hours to be
located generally King County southward, with a few peak gusts of:
Hoquiam at 58 MPH, Tacoma at 51 MPH, SeaTac at 49 MPH, and Olympia
at 48 MPH. In addition, gusts of 40 to 55 MPH have been noted with
the SE winds around Sequim to Admiralty Inlet. Wind hazards have
been updated to adjust the Wind Advisories and ongoing High Wind
Warnings. Winds will generally remain breezy King County southward
over the next few hours (gusts 30 to 50 MPH), with increasing west
winds across the Strait of Juan de Fuca for gusts 40 to 60 MPH for
Admiralty Inlet. Otherwise, winds will begin to taper further
this afternoon. In addition, mountain snow rates will remain
elevated this morning before tapers to showers this afternoon. If
you`re traveling check with WSDOT for road conditions.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Frontal system continues to track across Western
Washington this morning. Winds will remain gusty for some areas as
the bent back feature moves through the area. After a short break
tonight a weaker weather system will arrive Friday. Additional
systems will move through Saturday morning, Sunday and later
Monday. Possible atmospheric river arriving in the middle of next
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Satellite imagery shows
front moving through Western Washington early this morning with a
bent back occlusion off the coast at 11z/3am. Rain continues over
most of the area with snow in the higher elevations. Winds have
already picked up along the Central Coast with Hoquiam reporting
gusts to 45 mph. Temperatures were in the mid 40s over the
interior and near 50 degrees along the coast.

Satellite imagery and doppler radar showing the bent back
occlusion very clearly early this morning. Surface pressure has
started to rise at both Destruction Island and Buoy 41 off the
coast. The surface pressure bottomed out at 984 mb in both
locations which matches up well with model solutions. Pressure is
still falling at Quillayute but the winds which were easterly are
starting to come around to south southeasterly. The surface low is
therefore a little south and west of Quillayute at 11z. 00z models
in good agreement that near 984 mb low would be near Cape
Flattery at 12z. Low tracking eastward but weakening 12z-18z
ending up near the east entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca by
18z. This track will create a quick increase in pressure
gradients across the interior from about Snohomish county
southward. The Olympia to Bellingham surface gradient will go from
near 0 at 12z to plus 7 to 9 mb at 18z resulting in a rapid
increase in southerly winds around 15z/7 am over the interior.
In addition to the southerlies in the interior the surface
gradient through the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the Quillayute to
Bellingham gradient, will go from around -4 mb to plus 6 mb
resulting in a strong push of westerly winds down the Strait of
Juan de Fuca into Whidbey Island. There will also be an area of
convergence between the strong southerly coming up the Puget Sound
interior and the westerlies through the Strait creating an area
of not very strong winds between around Everett and Arlington.
As the low continues to weaken and move northeast winds will ease
all areas this afternoon.

The current forecast with high wind warnings for the coast, Northwest
Interior, San Juans and Admiralty Inlet this morning with a wind
advisory for the remainder of the lowlands looks good and no
changes will be made in the upcoming forecast package. One thing
to keep in mind is the rapid increase in the winds as well as a
quick change in wind direction will increase the chances for
power outages and downed trees even though the actual wind speeds
will be lower than what is usually needed to create these impacts.

In the mountains snow continuing today pretty good orographics
behind the bent back keeping snow going into the evening hours.
The Winter Storm Warning for the Cascades will continue until 10
pm tonight while in the Olympics the warning will come to an end
at 4 pm this afternoon.

A little break in the action tonight before the next system
approaches the area late tonight. Front is becoming more
negatively tilted with the jet diving into Northern California
which will slow the eastward progression down pushing the onset of
rain back until after midnight. There were some concerns about the
surface low associated with this system with previous model runs
putting the low center near the mouth of the Columbia River
Friday. 00z model runs have a weaker surface low with a little
further south track which will keeps winds in check over Western
Washington.

Front moving through Friday with another negatively tilted front
approaching by the end of the day. This feature will move through
Friday night into Saturday morning. Surface low associated with
this front moving inland over Vancouver Island Saturday which
could create some breezy/windy conditions over the Northwest
Interior.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement with the wet pattern staying intact over Western
Washington but a little more spacing between the systems for
longer breaks in the steady rain. Another system arriving Sunday
followed by a weaker one later Monday. Models have been pretty
consistent indicating a possible atmospheric river developing
midweek producing more significant rains over the area Wednesday
and possibly Thursday. None of these features have impactful winds
associated with them although there will be a pop of post frontal
southerly late Sunday. Felton

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface low pressure system continues to
move through Western Washington this morning. Surface lows remain
centered over Puget Sound and over by Neah Bay, with the warm sector
advancing over much of Puget Sound this morning, and the trailing
cold front/occluded front in the Chehalis Valley, and up through the
Olympics. The southwesterly flow aloft will turn westerly late this
morning into tonight. The winds have picked in most southern
interior terminals this morning (and up to Puget Sound as of 8 AM
PST). Wind have been sustained out of the southwest up to 20 kt
(with gusts to 35 kt and a few instances of gusts to 45 kt). Also
continue to see instances of wind shear as the front passes
(switching the direction aloft). The winds at the surface will turn
more southwesterly throughout the day, and start to decrease going
into this evening/tonight.

Areas of rain continue to pass through the terminals this morning.
This has reduced visibilities down to 2 SM at times (but otherwise
rain rates remain light and will continue to decrease through
today). Ceilings will remain in MVFR or VFR through this afternoon
and evening (some improvements expected once the precipitation wraps
up). Lower ceilings will redevelop early Friday morning, with bases
down to lower-end MVFR (IFR is possible south/west of Puget Sound).
Some mist/fog may mix in with the lower ceilings, but otherwise
conditions will become more uniformly MVFR later Friday.

KSEA...Terminal this morning is in the warm sector (cold
front/occluded front sits just to the west of the terminal). Gusty
winds have arrived this morning (highest gust observed was 37 kt,
but winds are expected to peak at 35 kt through late this morning).
Additionally, wind shear will be possible as winds aloft begin to
turn from more south to southwesterly. Expect winds to decrease
going into the afternoon/evening (and into tomorrow) to around 10
kt. The ceilings will remain MVFR this morning (with visibility
reductions possible with showers). There will be a chance for
improvement to VFR late this morning into the afternoon. Another
round of lower ceilings is expected early Friday morning through
late morning (ceilings around 1,500 ft).

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Active weather remains on tap across the region. Multiple
headlines remain in place and will generally remain that way at
least into this evening. Wind-driven headlines will see some
downgrade late this morning/this afternoon as winds ease from west
to east. The previous Storm Force Warning over the coast has been
replaced with a gale warning this morning. A Storm Force warning
remains over East Strait as HREF guidance hints at a 50% chance of
westerly Storm Force gusts this morning before ending by the
afternoon. Monitor latest forecasts and statements to see areas
impacted. Seas become the next issue, not only allowing for
prolonging headlines over the coastal waters, but also giving rise
to high surf concerns for the coast as seas ranging 20-24 ft will
continue to be a threat until gradually easing late this
afternoon/early this evening. As if these were not enough, the
combination of tides and strength of low pressure overhead is also
giving rise to coastal flooding concerns in the Strait. Inundation
forecasts still showing water 2 to 2.5 feet above ground level,
allowing for minor flooding of shorelines and low-lying coastal
areas. This threat should also ease by the early afternoon.

An additional weather system expected tonight into Friday may give
rise to additional headlines or extensions of those already present,
but have tried to tackle as much of this as possible with morning
forecast package. This disturbance has trended further south towards
the mouth of the Columbia so the strongest winds are to be over the
OR coastal waters. Nevertheless, an active pattern is likely to
remain over the weekend and possibly into next week, bringing an
additional period of stronger winds.

As stated, seas today generally 20-24 ft for much of the day before
easing down to 15-18 ft this evening before ramping back to up to 20-
24 ft by Friday morning. In a lather, rinse, repeat style pattern,
seas then ease back to 15-18 ft Friday afternoon. This oscillation
persists before finally settling below 10 ft on Monday.

.HYDROLOGY...Total precipitation for this latest front looks to be
mostly in the two to four inch range for the Olympics with some
five inch bullseye. This will push the Skokomish river into
moderate flood stage today. The remainder of the river flowing off
the Olympics will remain below flood stage.

While precipitation will be less with the systems beginning Friday
the lack of much of a break will keep rivers over the Southwest
Interior rising into the weekend. It`s possible that the lower
reaches of the Chehalis could flood late Friday into Saturday. The
Skookumchuck near Bucoda and the Newaukum near Chehalis could
reach action stage late Friday into Saturday.

Rivers across the remainder of the area will also be on the rise
in the next few days but the combination of a less precipitation
and a little cooler temperatures in the Cascades will keep the
rivers flowing off the Cascades in their banks through the weekend
into early next week.

With all of the precipitation the landslide threat will continue
to increase into the weekend. Felton
