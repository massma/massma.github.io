Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
323 AM PDT Fri Aug 2 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure aloft through the weekend with continued
above normal temperatures and dry weather. Increased onshore flow
along with lower heights aloft will bring cooler temperatures but
still warmer than average. Subtle shortwaves may usher marginal
thunderstorm potential over the Cascades into next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper-ridge centered over
the Four Corners region will influence conditions here in
Washington. As a result, the next several days will feature above
normal temperatures and continued dry weather. Closer to the
surface, an alongshore surge of marine stratus has made its way
unto the WA coast this morning. Coastal areas and parts of the SW
interior will wake up to overcast skies but as most times,
diurnal mixing will give way to mostly clear skies (with the
exception of smoke aloft) into the afternoon. Because of the
marine layer activity, a much cooler day is expected across the
coast with highs topping into the 60s. More inland locations
will remain well into the mid to upper 80s with Cascade valleys
in the lower 90s. Overnight lows are expected to be in the 50s and
60s.

Not much change in the upper-level pattern for both Saturday and
Sunday. Ridging remains largely in place as a subtle shortwave
resides off the coast. As the pattern progress, the mentioned
shortwave could interact with monsoonal moisture as a slight
chance (15%) of rain showers over the N Cascades makes its way
into the forecast early next week. Can`t rule out the isolated
threat for thunderstorms. Highs in the interior are to remain in
the 80s to near 90 F with continued 60s on the coast with
overnight lows in the 50s and 60s.

Moderate Heatrisk across most of the interior lowlands north of
Thursday County Friday onwards, down to minor elsewhere. A
moderate risk for heat-related impacts can affect most individuals
sensitive to heat, especially those without effective cooling
and/or adequate hydration.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Deterministic guidance has
the aforementioned shortwave tracking across WA Monday through
Wednesday. Will have to monitor the continued threat for elevation
convection. By Thursday, ensembles and deterministic models are
hinting at a upper-low drifting southward out of Alberta/BC and
upper-ridging upstream over the NE Pac. Can`t rule out additional
precipitation chances during this time.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Strong upper ridging remains centered over the Four
Corners region with south to southwest flow aloft over Western
Washington. The low level flow will become increasingly onshore
today. LIFR/IFR ceilings in marine stratus will spread northward
along the Washington coast this morning. It will briefly retreat
offshore this afternoon before spreading onshore once again this
evening. VFR conditions will prevail across the interior of Western
Washington with scattered high clouds and high level smoke/haze from
wildfires in the region. IFR/LIFR stratus will spread locally
inland tonight to near or just east of a KSHN-KCLM line by daybreak
Saturday.

KSEA...VFR today. Surface winds light southwesterly veering westerly
5 to 8 knots this afternoon.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Broad surface ridging will remain centered well offshore
with lower pressure across the interior for varying degrees of
onshore flow over the next several days. Thermally induced low
pressure shifting into interior of Western Washington will lead to
increasing onshore gradients and small craft advisory westerlies in
the central/east strait later today.  A weak upper trough settling
over the region late in the weekend is likely to increase the
onshore flow enough again for a repeat of small craft advisory
westerlies in the strait and northwesterly wind driven steep
seas over portions of the coastal waters.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
