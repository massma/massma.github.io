Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
846 AM PDT Sun Mar 16 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Lowland rain and mountain snow will continue through
Monday as multiple systems move across the Pacific Northwest.
Upper level ridging on Tuesday may provide a brief break in
precipitation. Another series of systems will move through the
region on Wednesday throughout the end of the week, bringing
additional rounds of lowland rain, mountain snow, and breezy winds
at times to western Washington.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Overall, the forecast
remains largely on track this morning. Scattered showers continue
to move across western Washington and will continue through the
day. Snow will continue for the mountains, with generally light
accumulations expected at the passes. The exception remains for
any banding that sets up tonight- where localized heavier mountain
snow amounts will be possible. The remainder of the previous
discussion follows below, with updates made to the aviation and
hydrology sections. 14

Broad upper level troughing over western Washington this morning
will continue to bring scattered rain showers across the area.
With the jet centered south of our region, can expect shower
activity to lighten up into the later afternoon hours. Snowfall in
the mountains will continue, with the Winter Storm Warning still
in effect until this afternoon. Snow levels generally around 2000
to 2500 feet will continue to support snowfall through the
mountains the rest of the day, although will be lighter this
evening as QPF values have lessened. The aforementioned broad
upper troughing will once again provide some instability across
western Washington, with a chance of an isolated thunderstorm or
two developing through this afternoon. The most likely areas to
see a lightning strike or two will be mainly coastal areas and
possibly the southern interior.

Widespread shower activity will continue into Monday, but will be
overall less in coverage. Snow levels on Monday look to drop to
around 1500 feet. Onshore flow will increase across the area as
well, with latest guidance suggesting a convergence zone to
develop across northern Puget Sound sometime in the afternoon.
Snow will continue in the mountains, but, with any strong banding
that develops, snow levels locally could drop further which would
allow higher snowfall accumulations over the Cascade Zones for a
period during this time.

Upper level ridging looks to develop on Tuesday for a brief break
in the weather before more active weather returns.

Daytime highs look to remain in the upper 40s to lower 50s with
overnight lows in the mid 30s.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...A series of systems will
traverse across western Washington starting on Wednesday, keeping
the weather pattern active, with widespread rain, more mountain
snow, and breezy winds. Another system will enter on Thursday and
Friday (with these systems looking a bit wetter at this time),
with additional systems through the weekend for more wet and
unsettled conditions.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft will transition to more westerly
through today as an upper trough axis shifts onshore. Generally
VFR/MVFR this morning for most areas with IFR as well due to
abundant moisture at the surface and lingering light rain. Cigs will
slowly improve to MVFR by 18-19z and into VFR for most by 20-22z. A
few lingering showers will be around this afternoon. Cigs will then
lower again early Monday morning. S/SW will continue through the
period.

.KSEA...MVFR will mix in with IFR at times through 18z. Cigs will
then slowly improve to VFR generally around 21z. Cigs will lower
again early Monday morning. S/SW surface winds 7 to 12 kts through
this evening. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...Weak troughing will persist over the waters into
early Monday then surface ridging over the offshore waters will
expand into area waters Monday afternoon and evening. This will lead
to an increase in onshore flow. The surface ridge will shift inland
on Tuesday and a frontal system will approach the coastal waters
Tuesday night. The front will move onshore on Wednesday with another
to follow late in the week.

Double digit seas over the coastal waters will ease below 10 feet
Monday and Tuesday before building again mid to late week as a
series of systems affect the waters.  27

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Conditions will remain showery into Monday. However,
at this time, flooding is not expected across most of the area`s
rivers over the next 7 days. The exception remains the Skokomish
River, which could enter flood stage late in the week as additional
wet systems move across the area.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
