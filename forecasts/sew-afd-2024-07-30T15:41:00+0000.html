Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
841 AM PDT Tue Jul 30 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Upper level trough exiting the area this morning with
an upper level ridge beginning to build this afternoon. Upper
level ridge continuing to build through Friday with the ridge axis
well east of the area. The ridge will weaken slightly as a weak
upper level trough forms offshore the first part of next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No updates to the forecast
this morning. Upper level trough exiting the area early this
morning with an upper level ridge beginning to build over the area
this afternoon from the southeast. Shower activity will come to
an end for the most part this morning. Deep layer of low level
moisture over the area with cloud tops around 6000 feet. Any
subsidence at all this morning will squeeze this low level
moisture. Have added areas of drizzle to the forecast for the
interior lowlands this morning. Even with the ridge building this
afternoon with such a deep marine layer expect cloudy skies until
well into the afternoon with only partly sunny skies by late
afternoon. Cloud cover most of the day will limit the daytime
heating to only up to about 10 degrees putting highs in the mid
60s to mid 70s.

Upper level ridge continuing to build tonight and Wednesday. Light
flow in the lower levels becoming northerly Wednesday afternoon.
This will scour out the low level moisture giving the area sunny
skies. By 00z Thursday 500 mb heights up to the mid to upper 580
dms. Temperatures will warm quickly with the sunshine Wednesday
with high near normal, around 70 on the coast and 70s and lower
80s inland. Lows tonight in the mid 50s to lower 60s.

Ridge building continuing Wednesday night and Thursday. 500 mb
heights in the lower 590 dms by late Thursday afternoon. 850 mb
temperatures which are only in the plus 10 to 12C range this
morning warming to the plus 20 to 24C range by late Thursday
afternoon. This weather pattern is the one we had for many days
in July. Low level flow never does turn offshore but with the
temperatures aloft so warm highs in the 80s and lower 90s over the
interior with mid 70s to lower 80s along the coast.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement with Western Washington remaining on the backside of the
strong upper level ridge through the period. Weak trough
developing offshore could put a small dent in the ridge early
next week. If that happens all it will do is lower the highs
temperatures a few degrees. Low level flow remaining onshore
through the period which will prevent highs from getting much
above 90 in the warmer locations. In general highs in the upper
70s to near 90 for the interior and in the 70s on the coast. Lows
in the mid 50s to lower 60s. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Moist northwest flow aloft over western Washington
this morning as an upper level trough continues to pass through the
region. MVFR ceilings primarily over the area this morning along
with areas of IFR/LIFR, especially in the typical lower prone
locations such as KHQM and KCLM. Expect this trend to largely
continue throughout the day with plentiful low level moisture, which
will keep low clouds around throughout the evening. Showers will
gradually taper off through the afternoon, with spotty coverage
across area terminals.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings this morning, with a 20% chance of IFR
ceilings through 16z. Southwesterly winds will generally maintain
5 to 10 knots through the remainder of the day. Low MVFR ceilings
will likely continue much of the day with showers tapering in the
afternoon.

.MARINE...A cold front has exited the area waters this morning,
with high pressure offshore gradually rebuilding through
Wednesday. Diurnally northerly winds will develop over the coastal
waters through the rest of the week, but will look to remain
under any threshold.

Coastal seas generally 3 to 5 feet through Friday but will
gradually build upwards to 6 to 7 feet in the outer water zones
into the weekend. Combined with a short period, can potentially
see some steepness to seas, especially farther offshore in the
outer water zones throughout the weekend.
