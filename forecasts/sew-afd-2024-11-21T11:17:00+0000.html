.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper-low looks to churn off the PNW coast through
the start of next week with active weather. A shortwave trough
will enter today with increased shower chances followed by a
strengthening surface low (not as intense as Tuesday`s) drawing
near on Friday. Here we`ll more widespread precipitation and gusty
winds.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Good morning, western
Washington. Current temperatures as of 1115z UTC: Boeing Field 43
F, Chehalis-Centralia Airport 48 F, Seattle Paine Field 46 F.

A beast of a surface low that`s responsible for greatly
inconveniencing western WA on Tuesday evening continues to swirl
and fill over the NE PAC. Its center is roughly 200 NM west of the
Vancouver Island coast and 350 NM WNW of Cape Flattery. Although
far away, we`ll continue to feel its influence today. Scattered
showers and temperatures in the upper 30s to mid 40s will start
things off. As the day progress, showers are on tap to persist
into the afternoon as a shortwave ejects out of the
aforementioned low center`s mid-level circulation. Snow levels are
to range between 3,000 to 4,000 ft as wintry precipitation is
slated for the higher passes. Rainfall will top out around
0.10-0.25" with snowfall less than an inch or two for mountain
passes such as Stevens. Showers are to end during the early
evening however, widespread rainfall will soon replace it.
Overnight lows are to fall into the 40s.

As alluded to, widespread rainfall will arrive during the early
morning hours on Friday. A deepening surface low will parallel the
coast similarly to its predecessor just a few days ago. By 12z
Friday, global deterministic guidance has this disturbance around
980 mb as its tightening pressure gradient increase wind speeds.
HREF probabilities has 70-80% chance of wind speeds greater than
30 mph on Friday along the immediate coastline as a Wind Advisory
has been issued. Probabilities are slightly less, but a Wind
Advisory has also been issued for the Cascade foothill due to
easterly gap winds Thursday night into early Friday morning.
Winds aren`t expected to be as strong as Tuesday evening`s but,
conditions could make clean up efforts more complicated for
already wind-beaten areas. A warm front will punch snowlevels
upwards above 6,000 ft so snow should transition over to rain
briefly but a trailing cold front will crash snowlevels back down
to 3,500 ft for the mountains by Tuesday evening. Showers will
linger into Saturday as the upper-low persists offshore. High
temperatures will warm to the lower to mid 50s on Friday before
falling to the upper 40s to near 50 F on Saturday.


.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Models are hinting at the
upper level low to move inland by Tuesday. There is some
uncertainty on where exactly the low will track towards. With the
low expected to depart, it appears the wet weather will be
replaced with drier weather come midweek as ridging builds back
into the region.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Deep low pressure continues to spin off SW B.C. today
with S/SW flow over WA. A trough axis will cross western WA this
afternoon with showers increasing. Ceilings will likely remain in
VFR range. 33

KSEA...Showers in the vicinity early this morning with shower
activity increasing this afternoon/evening from 20-02z. S/SE wind
around 5 kt becoming E and increasing by 09z. VFR conditions
expected. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A brief lull in the weather today before another deep
surface low spins offshore on Friday. This system again has
potential for storm force winds over the coastal waters and may
generate large S/SW swells over 20 ft. Easterly gales are also
possible through the Strait of Juan de Fuca and a Gale Watch is in
effect. Winds will ease and seas will subside over the weekend as
the low weakens over the offshore waters. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...The Skokomish river will stay between action
and minor flood stage through Saturday. As rain falls and with some
snowmelt contribution beginning on Friday morning, the river may
briefly rise into minor flood stage by late Friday into early
Saturday morning.

For the remainder of the rivers no flooding is expected. Lower snow
levels in the Cascades will limit runoff and reduce any flooding
chances for rivers flowing off the Cascades. Precipitation for the
remainder of the period will come in bursts. This combined with snow
levels remaining relatively low will keep rivers in their banks.
