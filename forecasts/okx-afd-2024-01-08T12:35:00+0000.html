Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
735 AM EST Mon Jan 8 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure builds over the waters today and then moves offshore
tonight. Deepening low pressure will track from the Midwest and
towards the Great Lakes Tuesday, sending a strong frontal
system through the area Tuesday night into Wednesday. Another
strong low pressure system could bring heavy rain and high winds
to the area late Friday into the weekend.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Forecast mainly on track. Adjusted cloud coverage and slightly
increased wind gusts this morning.

High pressure keeping dry conditions in place today. Subsidence
will lead to decreasing clouds and more sun for today. Forecast
highs for most locations will be in the lower 40s.

High pressure moves offshore tonight. Clouds increase late into
early Tuesday morning. Still enough time period for efficient
radiational cooling with ridging aloft to start tonight. Vast
range of lows from mid 30s for parts of NYC to upper teens for
parts of interior and Pine Barrens of Long Island.

Temperatures generally above climatology in the near term.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Key Points

* Significant storm system will impact the region Tuesday night
  into Wednesday.

* Heavy rain will cause potential flooding across the region
  Tuesday night into Wednesday. Longer timeframe for interior
  areas with flooding due to potential for elevated river and
  stream flows that will take longer to subside.

* Strongest winds with gusts potentially up to around 60 mph for
  Tuesday night along the coast, closer to 50 mph farther
  inland.

* Coastal flooding potential with Wednesday morning high tide
  but uncertainty on timing of greatest surge.


Key additions, added rest of region to flood watch. For NE NJ,
Lower Hudson Valley, and Southern CT this is a longer fused
flood watch from 6PM Tuesday to 6PM Wednesday, which covers any
rivers or streams that will take longer time for subsiding
levels. Some rivers and streams in these locations may remain
above their respective flood stages well after rain ends
Wednesday, lingering into the afternoon hours. Another element
with these interior areas is the added runoff from snowmelt from
pre-existing snowpack.

Now for the NYC and Long Island region, flood watch was issued
there but for shorter time duration, 6PM Tuesday to 12PM
Wednesday. There is potential for rapid rainfall accumulations
as indicated by some SREF and GFS ensemble members Tuesday night
especially in the mid evening to overnight hours. A quick 1 to 2
inches potentially in a 3 hour timespan, which approaches flash
flood guidance values.

Another key addition, Staten Island added to the high wind
watch in addition to Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island. This is
where there is highest potential for wind gusts near 60 mph
Tuesday night. Farther north and west, gusts are more limited to
near 50 mph. Forecast for winds was a combination of the
national blend of models and a blend of raw model data.

Deepening trough with strengthening upper level jet picks up Gulf
moisture Tuesday. The upper jets right rear quadrant approaches
getting near the region by early Wednesday.

Mid level trough moves across Wednesday with its associated
vorticity maximum. At the surface, low pressure deepens as it
travels from South Central US to the Great Lakes Tuesday into
Tuesday night. The increasing baroclinic zone will increase
frontogenesis and enhanced lift can be expected across the
region. With layer precipitable waters approaching near 1.3 to
1.4 inches Tuesday night, very heavy rain can be expected.
According to OKX sounding climatology, this is near max and well
above 90th percentile. This is from strong low level southerly
jet and increased low level moisture advection, low level jet
near 90 kt from numerical weather prediction models. Some
elevated instability will allow for an isolated thunderstorm
late Tuesday night.

CAMS depict a squall line amongst other areas of discrete heavy
rain from reflectivity forecasts that move across Tuesday night.

Bulk of rain finishes by early Wednesday morning, but more periodic
rain is forecast for Wednesday until early afternoon. POPs for
the rain Wednesday morning into early afternoon are chance. The
bulk of the rain will have ended early Wednesday morning, so
remainder of the morning into early afternoon, additional rain
will be light. Dry conditions are forecast mid to late Wednesday
afternoon.

Temperatures remain above climatological Tuesday night and
Wednesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...
A gusty, well-mixed but colder airmass builds in Wed ngt and
Thu. Strong subsidence so dry wx is expected. With the breezy
unidirectional flow, the NBM temps seemed reasonable with less
weight given to radiational cooling local climo.

The main focus of the long term will be on yet another deep low
tracking W of the area on Sat. The GFS has a 965 low near Detroit at
12Z Sat. The ECMWF is close at 970. H85 winds in the cwa modeled at
85kt. Another high wind event very possible. In addition, strong
moisture transport should yield a round of hvy rain, and possible a
few embedded tstms, at the onset. There is a significant dry slot
however that is progged to cut the pcpn off after the initial surge.

The occluded low tracks into Canada late Sat and Sun, leaving
strong wly flow locked into the area. There could be some pockets of
light snow rotating into the area around the deep low, although
downslope will attempt to dry things out before reaching the cwa.

The NBM with local adjustments was used for temps Fri-Sun.

.AVIATION /12Z MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
High pressure builds in today and offshore on Tue.

Mainly VFR thru 12Z Tue. MVFR CIGS develop quickly by 14Z Tue.

NW winds gusting to around 20-25kt this mrng, then gradually
diminishing this aftn. Light and vrb winds tngt, then winds quickly
increase aft 12Z Tue out of the SE.

   NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Gusts may only be ocnl at times today.

OUTLOOK FOR 12Z TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...

Tuesday: MVFR becoming IFR in the afternoon and night. Rain during
the afternoon and becoming heavy at night. E-ESE winds 15-20kt with
gusts 25-30kt in the afternoon. SE winds increasing Tuesday night to
25-35kt, gusting 40-50kt, highest winds along the coast. LLWS at
night with SE-S winds at 2kft of 70-80kt.

Wednesday: MVFR or lower with rain early in the the morning. Rain
ending by noon with conditions improving. S-SW wind 20-25kt gusting
35-45kt. Gusts decrease afternoon into the night.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>SCA remains on the ocean into this afternoon. SCA goes until 18Z
for Sandy Hook NJ to Fire Island NY segment and goes until 23Z
for Fire Island Inlet to Montauk Point segment.

Sub-SCA conditions briefly thereafter for tonight.

Tuesday conditions will ramp up quickly late day into the
evening. Brief SCA conditions late Tuesday will escalate to
gales in the evening and then storm force winds potentially late
evening into overnight. There is a storm force watch for all
waters Tuesday night.

Wednesday will likely have residual gales with otherwise
widespread SCA level wind gusts. Forecast leaning towards more
gales for Wednesday.

Gales Wed ngt come down to sca lvl winds on Thu. Winds diminish blw
sca lvls Thu ngt, but seas on the ocean generally remain blw 5 ft.
All waters may be blw sca lvls Fri, then winds ramp up quickly Fri
ngt into Sat with gales to storm force winds possible.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No hydrologic impacts are expected through tonight.

Rain increases Tuesday afternoon into the evening, becoming
moderate. Mostly heavy rain expected Tuesday night. Rain comes
to an end Wednesday morning. Bulk of rain expected Tuesday
night.

A total of 2 to 3 inches with locally higher amounts is
forecast.

Considering liquid equivalent added from snowmelt, the interior
areas will have more runoff. Coastal areas will also be nearly
saturated with their ground and have efficient runoff as well.

Whole area has potential for flash flooding Tuesday night.
River flood potential continues across the interior where
elevated river and stream flows will lead to enhanced flood
potential. The river flooding could very well linger into the
day Wednesday with longer residual time for stages to subside
across some rivers and streams.

The Weather Prediction Center Excessive Rainfall Outlook
has much of the interior in a moderate risk. The rest of the
forecast region remains in a slight risk. This is for Tuesday
into early Wednesday morning.

Hydrologic impacts are possible Fri ngt and Sat with another
round of hvy rain possible. The exact magnitude and extent of
the issues are uncertain this far out.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The potential for a significant coastal flood event with the
Wed AM high tide remains. Potential for SE storm force winds
Tuesday Night into early Wednesday, bringing potential for
widespread moderate to locally major coastal flooding. Early
guidance from Steven`s NYHOPS ensemble is producing surge values
of 3 to 4 ft. This will also coincide with increasing
astronomical tides with a new moon on Jan 11. Along the
oceanfront, potential for 15-20 ft surf causing widespread dune
erosion and scattered overwashes. Localized dune
inundation/breaches possible where dunes have been compromised
by earlier storm events.

Newest guidance shows a decrease in the NYHOPS ensemble for
South Shore Bays with regards to total water level. Because of
this change and uncertainty, feel chances for widespread moderate
coastal flooding are still low enough chance to hold off on
watch issuance.

Some coastal flood impacts are possible around the times of high
tide Fri ngt and Sat with another deep low tracking W of the
area.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
