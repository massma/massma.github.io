Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
250 PM PST Mon Feb 17 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A wet weather pattern will continue this week, with
showers continuing Monday into Tuesday. An organized frontal
system Wednesday and potential atmospheric river next weekend will
bring more widespread precipitation into the region. Temperatures
will continue to remain a few degrees above average through the
week and next weekend, with highs in the low to mid 50s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper air analysis shows
an upper level trough departing the region this afternoon towards
the east (will bring a lot of the cooler air with it eastward). A
surface trough remains just offshore (with a stationary front to
the north). Radar activity has winded down some this afternoon.
Heavy precipitation has wrapped up, but there remains a couple
areas of showers concentrated along the King/Pierce County line,
and also a few showers up in northern Snohomish/Skagit Counties
and the South Interior. Any additional rain (or snow in the
Cascades) that falls will be light and is not expected to produce
any additional impacts. Thus, the winter storm warning expired at
10 am for the Cascades earlier this morning. Areas of mist/low
clouds will keep temperatures a couple degrees cooler today with
most places observing temperatures in the upper 40s this
afternoon.

A weak transient ridge will move over western WA into Tuesday.
This will keep most of area dry on Tuesday (some lingering early
morning showers in the Cascades will dissipate in the morning).
Sky coverage is expected to remain mostly cloudy however, with
weak flow aloft not able to fan out a lot of moisture that
remains. There could be a few peaks of sunshine in some spots, but
otherwise expect conditions to remain relatively overcast.

Beginning Tuesday evening, another disturbance will approach
western WA as an upper level shortwave trough will dig down
towards northern CA, and be our next weather maker by mid week.
The more southern track of this trough did bring down QPF totals
slightly by mid week, as WA may only be on the occluded side of
the surface system underneath the trough (dissipating). Mean NBM
values put most of the lowlands between 0.5-0.75 inch of QPF early
Wednesday morning through Thursday morning, but there remains
about a 0.25 inch spread from the mean between the 10th and 90th
percentiles. Will get more hi-res guidance from the HREF in future
updates to help narrow the possible range of precipitation
solutions for Wednesday. Snow levels will be cold enough again for
some mountain snow in the passes (mean NBM output has 5 inches at
Stevens Pass, and 3 inches at Snoqualmie Pass - slight decrease
from previous model runs). Some east Cascade gap winds may also
play a role in how much snow falls in the Cascade region overall
(gusts up to 25-30 mph possible Wednesday morning). It may also be
breezy along the coast and parts of the North Interior Wednesday
morning.

Expect the precipitation Wednesday to wrap up Thursday morning as
the trough/front move out of the region. There again remains some
slight chance/chance of showers on Thursday, but QPF amounts are
extremely light (1 or two hundredths) that most areas again may
not see precipitation.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Ensembles keep the
probabilities of above average temperatures and precipitation
through the end of the week into the weekend. Friday will keep the
pattern of Thursday going with a few showers possible (otherwise
mostly dry across the region with mostly cloudy skies).

There remains an increased chance of atmospheric river event going
into next weekend (as IVT analysis shows a good chunk of moisture
approaching the WA coast from the moist conveyor belt under a
more broad and slow moving trough offshore). It is still too early
to advertise any potential precipitation totals with this system,
but early signals show the potential for significant wetting rain
that may cause some flooding concerns along area rivers (see
hydrologic discussion below for further details).

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak troughing over western WA is shifting east
tonight. The flow aloft is W to NW. The low level air mass remains
moist with light rain and MVFR to IFR conditions. High pressure
moves inland on Tuesday with little improvement to overall
ceilings given the moist and stable conditions. Rain spreads
inland late Tuesday with the next incoming warm front. 33

KSEA...IFR to MVFR conditions tonight with light rain or mist.
Slow improvement on Tuesday. More rain by 00-06Z Wed. S/SE wind
around 5 kt. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>S flow increases on Tuesday with the next incoming warm
front. There`s potential for gales over the outer coastal waters -
a Gale Watch is in effect. Seas remain elevated, building to 10-15
ft over the coastal waters by Wednesday. Winds will ease by
midweek, then rise again with the next strong frontal system
toward the end of the week. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...A pair of frontal systems will move across Western
Washington this week bringing modest precipitation to the area.
Snow levels will remain in the 3000 to 4000 ft range into Friday.
Models continuing to show the potential for at atmospheric river
event this weekend with the atmospheric river possibly remaining
over the area into Monday. Widespread river rises will result if
this scenario plays out with the possibility of flooding along the
Skokomish River and other rivers flowing off the Olympics like
the Satsop and the Bogachiel. A longer duration atmospheric river
event would also put pressure on rivers flowing off the Cascades.
Until this weekend, no flooding is forecast. The Skokomish may
rise into action stage Tuesday or Wednesday. Felton
