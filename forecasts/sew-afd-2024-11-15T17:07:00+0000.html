Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
907 AM PST Fri Nov 15 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Isolated showers will continue today as an upper
level ridge builds through the region for a brief break in the
weather. Cool and unsettled conditions return this weekend and
will persist into early next week as another wet system moves into
the area, and once again through midweek. Upper level ridging may
look to develop near the end of next week which could promote
drier conditions.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The current forecast remains
on track with no updates this morning. Patchy fog will likely
lift by the early afternoon, while light shower activity lingers
through the morning. Mostly cloudy skies throughout the day with
the chance for some sunbreaks, along with some isolated shower
activity mainly in the Cascades. Tidal forecasts continue to show
coastal flooding concerns along the coast this morning, therefore
a Coastal Flood Advisory will remain into the afternoon. High
temperatures generally in the mid to upper 40s.

The next frontal system will move across the area on Saturday,
bringing another round of widespread precipitation, breezy winds,
and mountain snow. Snow levels will initially be low in the
mountains early on Saturday around 1500-2000 feet, before a warm
front lifts across the area, quickly rising snow levels to around
5000 to 6000 feet. Snow will likely start initially as snow early
on Saturday morning, but will quickly change over to rain once
those snow levels rise. once the warm front exits the region, a
cold front will swing through on Sunday, allowing snow levels to
drop towards 1500 to 2000 feet throughout the day, allowing for
heavy snow accumulations throughout the Cascades. Snow may
potentially be heavy at times, especially at Stevens and
Snoqualmie Pass, therefore, A Winter Storm Watch remains in
effect for all of the Cascades through late Monday.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...The previous storm system
will still allow moderate to heavy precipitation at times through
Monday as another front crosses the region, lowering snow levels
to around 1000 to 1500 feet. Lowland rain and mountain snow look
to continue into Tuesday.

Latest guidance is hinting at another system pushing through our
area late Tuesday into Wednesday, for another round of heavy snow
in the mountains and lowland rain. There is some uncertainty
regarding this pattern as previous model runs had this system
positioned differently. As of now, it does look like the weather
will remain active through the rest of the week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light flow aloft will become north to northwesterly as a
weak upper ridge offshore briefly noses into the region. Light
surface winds and residual moisture from recent rains has lead to a
mix of MVFR to LIFR conditions across much of the area through the
rest of the morning. Improvement to VFR is expected most areas by
around 20Z.

KSEA...VFR currently and should trend throughout the remainder of
the day. Surface winds light south/southwesterly will veer to light
north/northwesterly for a period this afternoon before backing to
southerly once again tonight.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak surface ridge will build across the waters today
allowing for lighter winds. Small craft advisories remain in place
across the coastal waters today as seas will remain above 10 feet
through at least midday. The ridge will shift inland tonight and a
warm front will move into the coastal waters Saturday afternoon. A
trailing cold front will sweep onshore early Sunday. Gale watches
have been posted for the coastal waters as well as the east entrance
to the strait for much of Saturday. Small craft advisories will
likely be needed for the remainder of the waters for the period
Saturday through Sunday. Weak surface ridging briefly builds over
the waters later Monday into Monday night. Models are beginning to
show the possibility of an intense sub-960 millibar surface low
rapidly deepening over the offshore waters Tuesday into Tuesday
night. Confidence in the track and strength of this system is low at
this stage, but it is likely, at a minimum, to generate some pretty
large seas (20+ feet) in addition to other hazards and will bear
watching. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Scattered to isolated showers will gradually diminish
throughout the day. Except for parts of the Chehalis, rivers are
cresting and have already begun falling early this morning. The
Skokomish River will fall below flood stage later this morning.

Another system will move into the region Saturday into early Monday,
bringing more widespread precipitation to the area. Lowlands could
see up to an inch and mountains 2 to 4 inches of precipitation. Snow
levels will fluctuate quite rapidly, with snow levels rising up to
5000-7000 ft Saturday then back down to 2000-4000 ft on Sunday.
Expect rises on area rivers, with the largest rises again expected
on the rivers flowing off of the Olympics and the north and central
Cascades. Currently no river flooding is expected outside of the
Skokomish river, which may return to minor flood stage by Sunday.
Flooding potential will depend on temperatures, QPF, and snow levels
and will continue to be monitored over the next few days. The
weather pattern looks like it will continue to bring periods of
precipitation through next week.
