Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
805 PM PST Sun Nov 17 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Scattered showers and a slight chance of thunderstorms
remain in the forecast through Monday. A very strong and rapidly
developing frontal system will approach late Tuesday with the
potential for high winds across the marine waters and heavy snow
in the mountains. The active pattern will likely continue for the
remainder of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Snow, heavy at times,
continues in the Cascades tonight and a Winter Storm Warning
remains in effect. Stevens Pass has seen 6 inches so far with more
to come, especially with the convergence zone over the region.
Snoqualmie Pass is sitting at 33 degrees but will drop into the
20s overnight with snow there as well. Otherwise, a cool night
ahead with lowland lows in the 30s and temps near freezing around
the south sound. 33

Previous discussion...A cold front is well east of the Cascades
as it tracks across the Inland Northwest. In it`s wake, scattered
showers are pushing ashore western Washington with lowland
rainfall. With cold air aloft filtering in, snow has been observed
across the mountains and will persist overnight as snow levels
fall between 1,500 to 2,000 ft. To add to the fun, a developing
PSCZ is on tap to meander around Central Puget Sound. This feature
will add to the mountain snow fall as a Winter Storm Warning
remains in place for the Cascades through Monday morning. Low-
level and mid-level lapse rates are indicative of instability as a
slight chance (15%) of thunderstorms is in the forecast for this
evening as well. Low temperatures are to range between the mid to
upper 30s.

A similar story leads into Monday as we start the new week.
Showers and slight thunderstorm chances remain within this
unstable, post-frontal airmass. Minor coastal flooding is again a
possibility, mainly for Puget Sound northward towards the Strait
of Georgia during the morning. High temperatures are to top out
several degrees below average with values in the mid 40s with
overnight lows again in the 30s.

A big pattern shift will take place on Tuesday. Models are
indicating a potent upper-level jet streak cutting across the NE
PAC taking aim at the WA/OR coast. Favorable dynamics aloft over
a sharp gradient of baroclinicity will allow for explosive
cyclogenesis. Guidance continues to agree on the development of an
intense sub-950 mb area of low pressure bombing over the offshore
waters. Most notable impacts associated with the type of set up
are high winds, especially within the Cascade gaps. Just a smidge
too early to issue any wind related headlines but the threat of
power outages, damage to trees and other structures cannot be
ruled out for these locations. Along with high winds, widespread
rainfall will again enter the region as a atmospheric river
landfalls. Models have a vast stretch of moisture spreading across
N CA to SW BC. QPF totals across the Peninsula range between 1-3"
along the coast with 2-4" over the Olympics with locally higher
amounts possible Tuesday into Wednesday. Rises along area rivers
will likely result. A rain shadow across the interior should make
for lower totals. Temperatures will gradually rise Tuesday and
closer to seasonal averages on Wednesday.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...An active pattern looks to
remain through the long term forecast. Guidance has broad upper-
level troughing offshore ejecting disturbance after disturbance
into the PNW and keeping PoPs in the forecast. Must admit some
degree of uncertainty exists towards Sunday. But, climatologically
November is the wettest month of the year so it looks like
business as usual for the next several days. Temperatures will
hover around average.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Flow aloft shifting westerly to northwesterly tonight as
an upper level trough moves through W WA followed quickly by a
shortwave ridge. Zonal flow returns Monday morning and for much of
the remainder of the day. Surface winds favoring a general southerly
direction with variances to the southwest or southeast depending on
location. Speeds easing at most locations, ranging 5-10 kts. SEA
proves the outlier here with speeds still in the 10-15 range with
gusts up to 25 kt still possible.

A mix of VFR to MVFR conditions over W WA this evening with MVFR
generally focused around the Sound...including BFI and SEA. PAE as
well as the rest of Snohomish and Skagit counties still seeing cigs
and precip associated with slowly diminishing PSCZ that lingers
there. Continued showers over portions of the CWA will allow for
periodic lowering cigs for VFR sites to dip down into MVFR or IFR
conditions. Overall, generally trend is for cigs to lower at all
terminals overnight thanks to persistent low level moisture from
continuing precip. Current TAFs may be a little aggressive with
timing, however widespread MVFR to IFR conditions expected to
materialize in the 09-12Z timeframe...with spots that are already
MVFR likely remaining there for tonight and overnight. Terminals
expected to see improvement back to VFR conditions in the mid to
late morning hours Monday thanks to brief surface ridging.

KSEA...MVFR conditions likely to remain in place tonight and during
the overnight hours. While some improvement is possible during the
early morning hours Monday, VFR conditions do not look to return
until around 15Z. These higher cigs will remain in place for the
rest of the TAF period. Scattered showers still in the forecast for
the terminal, however given areal layout and potential weakening,
either VCSH or -SHRA seem like best courses of action at this time.
Gusts should ease in the 06-08 timeframe, but southerly winds will
remain in place ranging 5-10 kts.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An extended small craft advisory will remain in place for
the coastal waters and western Strait of Juan de Fuca for heightened
seas and adjacent periods. Seas will build further towards 12-18 ft
overnight. Models have been consistent in regards to an intense sub
960-millibar surface low deepening over the offshore waters Tuesday
night. While there remains uncertainty regarding the exact track and
strength of this system, expect another round of strong winds to
develop over the coastal waters. There remains a high likelihood,
generally 50 to 60 percent chance per the NBM, that winds over the
coastal waters could blow at Storm Force criteria. As such,
inherited Storm Watch remains in place for Tuesday afternoon into
Wednesday. The possibility for gusts over 55kt during the span of
the watch cannot be ruled out. Additionally, wave heights between 25
to 27 feet over the outer coastal waters will be possible during
that time.

Models suggest that the need for additional headlines likely in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca for the Tuesday/Wednesday system, as strong
gradients suggests easterly winds there will meet criteria. Holding
off on this for now, as it is just out of operational window for
such products.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Another 2-4 inches in the Olympics on Tuesday and
Wednesday will force sharp rises on the Skokomish River in Mason
County with flooding possible. Elsewhere, rivers remaining below
Action Stage with lower snow levels in the Cascades.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
