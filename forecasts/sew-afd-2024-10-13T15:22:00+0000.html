Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
822 AM PDT Sun Oct 13 2024

.SYNOPSIS...An upper level ridge will produce one last dry and
mild day across Western Washington today before a series of
frontal systems bring rain, mountain snow, and progressively
cooler temperatures in the week ahead.

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Most areas are under clear skies this morning. However,
localized areas of dense fog continue in the Southwest Interior
(primarily along and west of a line from Bremerton to Shelton to
Olympia to Chehalis). All of the fog will clear out by noon across
western Washington. Mix of high clouds and clear skies will
continue through the afternoon, with lower clouds not forming
until after midnight (with the first of a series of frontal
systems passing through Monday).

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...An upper level ridge
shifting eastward will give Western Washington one final
completely dry day before a significant pattern shift brings a
series of fronts into the region in the week ahead. A layer of
stratus along the coast will make partial progress inland this
morning, but the remainder of the area will see a mostly sunny day
after any patchy fog dissipates. High clouds will start to creep
in by afternoon as the first of a series of frontal systems
approaches. The first front will be rather weak. Rain will reach
coastal areas by early Monday morning then spread inland toward
afternoon. Overall QPF will be on the light side with this system.
After a brief break Monday night into early Tuesday, a secondary
more potent system will arrive by Tuesday night with another round
of rain.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Wednesday will likely
be the pivotal day this week as a fairly strong front swings
onshore and the trailing upper trough arrives with snow levels
tumbling to some of the higher passes by late Wednesday night.
The upper trough remains overhead into Thursday for plenty of
shower activity and cooler temperatures.

There`s a noticeable difference between both deterministic runs
and the suite of ensembles toward the end of the week. And this
could have significant implications in terms of the weekend
forecast. The models have some degree of upper ridging returning
to the West Coast, but the strength and placement of the ridge is
important. There is a definitive split between the GFS and ECMWF
ensembles. A vast majority of the GFS ensembles depict an
atmospheric river funneling over the top of the ridge into mostly
southern British Columbia while the ECMWF/Canadian ensembles are
significantly more bullish with putting Western Washington in the
crosshairs of the moisture. Current forecasts have likely PoPs
for most of the area on Saturday, but if the ECMWF proves correct,
we`ll probably be looking at categorical PoPs everywhere with
considerable boosts to the QPF forecast. 27

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Increasing southwesterly flow into Monday with upper
troughing over the NE Pacific and an approaching frontal system
tonight into Monday morning. So far this morning, fog and stratus
have been confined to areas of the Kitsap peninsula and along the
coast. Temperature and dewpoint spreads have narrowed, but radiation
fog development in other places is unlikely to occur now given
daylight. OLM will also retain fog until around 17Z to 18Z before
scattering out, with other locations now at a 10 percent chance or
less of developing any fog or stratus. Expect a VFR afternoon with
generally light southerly to southwesterly surface flow. Cigs will
then lower tonight into Monday morning ahead of a frontal system.

KSEA...VFR conditions early this morning with just a few high
clouds. The probabilities for any fog or stratus intrusion at the
terminal have decreased to around 10 percent, as the surface flow
and onshore pressure gradients are weak and much less supportive of
anything developing compared to the last few mornings. VFR high
clouds this afternoon, with lowering cigs early Monday morning ahead
of a frontal system. S/SE winds this morning, becoming S/SW this
afternoon. JD/Kristell<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...Light southerly winds expected for the interior waters
today, with continued south to southeast winds for the Coastal
Waters. There may be a few localized gusts to SCA for the outer
Coastal Waters today, but expected to remain localized and not
widespread for a Small Craft Advisory. Southerly winds will then
increase tonight into Monday for all area waters as a front moves
across Western Washington. Small Craft Advisory has been issued for
the Coastal Waters with the south winds into Monday morning. South
winds will also increase for portions of the interior waters,
especially for Admiralty Inlet and areas of the northern inland
waters Monday morning. There may be a few SCA wind gusts for these
waters on Monday, and will have to monitor the need for any
additional SCA headlines. Otherwise, winds will become lighter
Monday night through Tuesday. Another, potentially stronger front,
is expected to move through the area Tuesday night into Wednesday.
Additional headlines possible for increasing south to southwest
winds during this period. A post-frontal westerly push is forecast
on Wednesday for the Strait of Juan de Fuca as well.

Seas 5 to 7 feet through today will build to 10 to 13 feet later
tonight into Monday. For this reason, Small Craft Advisories
continue for the Coastal Waters due to seas Monday into Monday
night. Seas are expected to then briefly subside below 10 feet later
Tuesday before increasing to near 10 feet Wednesday and potentially
into Thursday. JD
