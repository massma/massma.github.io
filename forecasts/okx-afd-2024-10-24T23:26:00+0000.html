Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
726 PM EDT Thu Oct 24 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will build from the west through Friday. A cold
front will move through late Friday night into Saturday morning,
followed by a stronger high building in through the middle of
next week. A warm front will also pass to the north Tuesday into
Tuesday night.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM FRIDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>As surface high pressure builds from the west, gusty northerly
winds should diminish this evening, and a clear, quiet night is
ahead as the high settles in. The lightening winds and clear
skies may allow for some areas of frost development in the
coldest locales tonight, generally confined to the far interior.
Hoisted a Frost Advisory for Orange Co, where temperatures look
just cold enough in the lower/mid 30s for areas of frost to be
possible if enough low level moisture exists. Elsewhere,
temperatures won`t be quite as cool, generally bottoming out in
the 40s along the coast.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM FRIDAY MORNING THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>After a chilly start, with the potential for a bit of frost
across the interior, the work week comes to a cool and dry
close.

Heights climb aloft as ridging amplifies over the region on
Friday with surface high pressure building overhead. The
subsidence should maintain abundantly clear skies much of the
day. Winds will be much lighter in a weak pressure gradient. It
will also be a bit cooler with highs in the low to mid 60s,
mainly due to the lowering subsidence inversion limiting the
depth of the mixed layer.

Winds back to the south and west in the afternoon as the high
sags south, and a bit of high clouds may attempt to sneak in
late ahead of another approaching cold front, though conditions
are expected to remain entirely dry through Friday night.
Temperatures run mild overnight with the ongoing weak WAA, with
lows generally ranging from the mid 40s to mid 50s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front will pass through Saturday morning, followed by a
drying/gusty NW flow and temps a few degrees above normal before
CAA kicks in later in the day and at night, with lows in the
30s and 40s. Sunday and Monday will be on the cooler side, with
temps a few degrees below normal, mostly in the mid/upper 50s,
with some lower 60s in parts of the NYC metro area. Some near to
sub freezing temps are possible in the interior valleys Sunday
night and Mon night.

Moderation in temps will begin on Tue, with temps returning to
near normal. Then as a warm front passes to the north, another
unseasonably warm stretch expected, with highs in the 70s both
Wed and Thu, possibly nearing 80 in urban NE NJ per blend of NBM
and its 75th percentile.

Dry wx expected through the period, which would put the driest
October or all-time driest month of record in jeopardy at our
climate sites.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
