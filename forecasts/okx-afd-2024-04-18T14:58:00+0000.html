Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
1058 AM EDT Thu Apr 18 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak wave of low pressure off the Mid Atlantic coast will keep
a frontal boundary well to the south today. High pressure will
briefly build in tonight into Friday before a cold front passes
through Friday night into Saturday morning. High pressure will
then follow from Saturday afternoon into early next week. A weak
frontal system will impact the region mid week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Forecast remains on track with only minor changes needed.
Previous discussion follows.

Stacked low pressure over south central Canada will move slowly
ENE today, with high amplitude upper level ridging over the
Northeast and eastern Great Lakes region shifting eastward. At
the surface, a weak wave of low pressure off the Mid Atlantic
coast will keep a frontal boundary well to the south.

Chances for showers will continue today, but will slowly
diminish as high pressure noses in from SE Canada. This, coupled
with the incoming ridge aloft, will bring in just enough
subsidence to bring showers to an end over much of the area by
late afternoon. Showers may transition to just some drizzle
given abundant low level moisture with the maritime high
building in.

The high building in with the weak low to our south will mean a
strengthening easterly flow today. It does not look to be overly
windy, with sustained winds of 15 to 20 mph and gusts to 25 mph
along coastal sections this morning. Winds start to diminish
this afternoon as the high continues to nose into the region,
with the weak low well out to sea by this point.

The E flow will also mean cooler than normal temperatures, with
highs only in the upper 40s/lower 50s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The sfc high will continue building in through Friday morning as
the upper ridge axis moves east, so dry conditions expected
through this time frame. A cold front associated with the low in
Canada will advance east, with an associated line of showers and
thunderstorms over the central Great Lakes region weakening as
it heads toward the eastern Great Lakes and then runs into the
high over the Northeast. So just chance to slight chance for
showers expected as this line moves through Friday night and
Saturday morning (lingering showers for eastern areas).

Temperatures recover somewhat on Friday, with highs in the 50s.
Even warmer conditions expected for Saturday with a westerly
flow and downsloping conditions expected after the passage of
the cold front. Went a couple of degrees above guidance for
highs, which are expected to be in the mid/upper 60s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will continue to build into the region through the
second half of the weekend and remain in control of the
weather through Tuesday.

A 500mb trough then shifts through the Great Lakes on Tuesday
with an associated weak surface low and cold front. Rain
chances increase Tuesday night into Wednesday as this system
moves across the region. Drier weather returns for Thursday.

Temperatures just below normal on Sunday should rebound a few
degrees from Monday through Wednesday, to near or just above
normal. Temperatures fall back a degree or two below normal
behind the cold front on Thursday. Temperatures each day will be
in the upper 50s or 60s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /15Z THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak low pressure slowly moves southeast of the terminals
through this evening. High pressure builds in from Maine
through Friday morning.

Mainly IFR conditions into this afternoon with some improvement
to MVFR likely for CT terminals. Light rain and drizzle will
continue into the afternoon. Improving conditions should
gradually make their way southwest into this evening with MVFR
becoming likely at Long Island terminals after 19-20z and then
elsewhere 22-00z. Improvement to VFR is then likely overnight.

Amendments will be likely for changing flight categories into
the evening.

ENE-NE winds 10-15 kt with gusts 20-25 kt, especially NYC on
east. Gusts end this evening with NE winds under 10 kt
overnight.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Gusts may be occasional into the afternoon.

Amendments for changing flight categories likely into the
evening.

OUTLOOK FOR 12Z FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY...

Fri: VFR early, then MVFR afternoon and at night with a chance
of showers.

Sat: MVFR with showers ending in the early morning, becoming
VFR. W-WNW wind gusts 15-20 kt.

Sun through Mon: VFR.

forecasts, can be found at: https:/www.weather.gov/zny/n90<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Easterly winds will increase today with 25 to 30 kt gusts
expected on all waters except NY Harbor as high pressure builds
from the northeast.

Gusts diminish tonight as the high continues to build in. The
non ocean waters will likely drop below 25 kt early this evening
if not sooner. The ocean waters will likely have gusts over 25
kt hanging on into this evening.

Ocean seas build to 6 to 9 ft today and up to 5 ft on the far
ern Sound zone (western Block Island Sound), diminishing
thereafter but remaining above 5 ft on the ocean into daytime
Friday. Have extended SCA for the ocean into daytime Fri.

High pressure will continue to build early next week.
This should keep conditions at sub-advisory levels through at
least Tue night. Conditions may build back to SCA levels on Wed
with the next low pressure and associated cold front
to approach.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
