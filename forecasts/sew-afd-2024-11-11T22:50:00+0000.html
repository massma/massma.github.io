Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
250 PM PST Mon Nov 11 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Post frontal showers and breezy winds will continue
today and tonight ahead of the next incoming system. A strong low
pressure system will move into western Washington Tuesday
afternoon, bringing in widespread precipitation, breezy winds,
chances of thunder, and potential river flooding through Thursday.
Troughing will continue through the rest of the period for
continued cool and unsettled conditions.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Unsettled conditions will
continue tonight through Tuesday morning as post-frontal shower
activity continues to spread inland. Locally breezy winds up to
25 to 35 mph will continue alongside snowfall above 4000 ft and
gradual rises to area rivers. Snow accumulations at SR 20 and
Washington Pass may be heavy at times, therefore the Winter
Weather Advisory for the North Cascades remains in effect.
Additionally, strong waves of 14 to 20 feet approaching the
coastline tonight may generate high surf conditions locally, but
impacts are not expected to be widespread.

A stronger storm system will move into western Washington Tuesday
afternoon through Thursday, with the following impacts:

* WIND: Winds will increase Tuesday afternoon through Wednesday
  morning, with widespread gusts of 35 to 45 mph. The strongest
  winds will be along the coast and lowland areas north of
  Everett.

* RIVER FLOODING: Expect continued rises on area rivers due to
  additional rainfall. At this time, flooding on the Skokomish
  river is expected to reach Moderate flood stage, but other area
  rivers will see rises and chances for flooding, particularly in
  the Cascade and Olympic Basins.

* THUNDERSTORMS: Chances for thunderstorms remain in the forecast
  through Wednesday, particularly along the coast.

* COASTAL FLOODING: Potential coastal flooding impacts continue to
  be monitored for Wednesday and Thursday, where minor flooding
  impacts are possible.

A deep upper level trough will push inland Tuesday afternoon into
Wednesday, bringing in a slew of weather impacts including
periods of moderate to heavy rainfall, mountain snow, breezy
winds, and river and coastal flooding. The initial and heaviest
wave of rainfall will spread inland during the afternoon and
evening hours Tuesday, with the bulk of the incoming moisture
centered over the Olympics and North Cascades. The upper level
low will cycle offshore, maintaining shower activity throughout
the day Wednesday while keeping a chance for thunderstorms to
develop along the coast. The trough axis will shift inland on
Thursday, maintaining unsettled conditions. Snow levels will hover
between 4000-5000 ft throughout the short-term, with snowfall
amounts ranging between 12 to 24 inches over 5000 ft and locally
higher amounts over the highest peaks. The lowlands are on track
to see 1 to 2 inches of rainfall over the course of mid-week, with
amounts nearing 4 to 6 inches of liquid over the Olympics.
Continuous precipitation over the area renews the potential for
river flooding, with the Skokomish River forecast to reach
Moderate Flood stage and several area rivers forecast to reach
Action Stage with this incoming precipitation. Refer to the
Hydrology section below for more details related to river
flooding. In addition, potential for coastal flooding continues to
be monitored along the coast and along the Puget Sound where
minor impacts are possible Wednesday and Thursday.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Forecast models continue to
favor troughing over the region, maintaining wet and cool
conditions over western Washington through the weekend. Snow
levels are on track to fall to 2500-3000 ft over the weekend, with
accumulating snowfall likely through the Cascade Passes.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A trough will cross western WA tonight for additional
showers and gusty surface winds. Ceilings are mainly VFR with
pockets of MVFR in showers. The air mass remains slightly unstable
near the coast with isolated thunderstorms possible. Showers will
be mainly over the coast and mountains Tuesday morning with rain
increasing again by 00Z Wednesday. 33

KSEA...Showers remain in the vicinity tonight with gusty S/SW
winds to 20 kt. Possible MVFR cigs in showers. Brief break during
the day Tuesday then rain spreading inland by 00-03Z.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A large swell train will reach the coast tonight with
seas building to 15 to 21 feet. Seas will subside on Tuesday but
still remain 13-16 feet. A strong front will reach the region
Tuesday afternoon and evening with gales over the coastal waters,
east entrance and northern inland waters (with Small Craft
Advisory winds elsewhere). Winds will ease early Wednesday.
Onshore flow prevails through the end of the week, then turns
offshore (and strengthens) over the weekend with the next incoming
frontal system.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Widespread showers (some moderate to heavy at times)
will continue Monday afternoon, and again Wednesday as an active
weather pattern continues. The precipitation amounts will be
strongly orographically influenced with precipitation totals in the
mountains expected to be 3 to 5 inches from both storms. Except
locally over 6 inches on the Olympics for the last one (Wednesday).

The succession of storms will increasingly build up soil moisture
and river levels throughout this period which will increase the
possibility for river flooding. Snow levels vary generally from 4000
to 6000 feet which will impact precipitation type and affect the
amount of storm runoff.

For other rivers, significant rises are expected with several river
forecast points above Action Stage, and flooding could be possible,
especially in the Northern and Central Cascades. Flooding extent
will continue to depend on rainfall rates, temperatures, as well as
snow levels with precipitation that rises and falls with each of
these weather systems next week. We will continue to assess the
hydrologic conditions and forecasts for any additional areas of
potential flooding as they arise.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
