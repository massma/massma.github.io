Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge well offshore with northwesterly
flow aloft through Friday. Ridge shifting east reaching Western
Washington Saturday night. The ridge will remain in place Sunday
before weakening Monday. Surface high pressure will remain
offshore into next week. A thermally induced surface trough will
move up the coastline Saturday night then shift over the inland
Sunday and east of the area on Monday. Unseasonably warm
temperatures Sunday and Monday before a cool down next Tuesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
stratus along the coast, Southwest Interior, surrounding the
Olympics, over the Puget Sound area south of Seattle and along
the Cascade foothills. Mostly clear skies over the Northwest
Interior. Temperatures at 4 am/11z were in the mid 40s to mid 50s.

Stratus filling in over the remainder of the Puget Sound area
early this morning. IR satellite imagery shows Black Hills above
the tops of the stratus so estimate the tops around 2000 feet.
Light gradients this morning will not reenforce the stratus. With
the layer 1000-1500 feet thick expect a midday breakout for the
interior and early afternoon breakout for the coast. Upper level
ridge well offshore but 500 mb heights over the area in the mid to
upper 570 dms this afternoon. This combined with the light
surface gradients will push temperatures into the mid 60s to mid
70s with the warmer locations in the upper 70s late this
afternoon.

Weak shortwave riding by well to the north tonight. Other than
briefly denting the ridge over the area this feature will not
create any weather. Weak low level onshore flow with stratus
developing along the coast. Lows in the upper 40s to mid 50s.

Upper level ridge building slightly Friday with surface gradients
going flat by afternoon. Stratus along the coast will have trouble
getting very far inland in the morning with the weak onshore
flow. Less morning clouds and slightly warmer temperatures aloft
combining to add a couple of degrees to the highs. Warmer
locations pushing 80 degrees. Most places away from the water
will have highs in the 70s. Afternoon northwesterlies will keep
highs on the coast in the 60s.

Upper level ridge continuing to slowly build over Western
Washington Friday night and Saturday. After lows mostly in the 50s
Friday night another warm day Saturday with highs in the 70s to
lower 80s.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Models in good agreement
with a thermally induced surface trough moving up the coastline
Saturday night. The trough will move inland Sunday making it the
warmest day of the forecast period. Most locations in the mid 70s
to mid 80s with highs near 90 over the Southwest Interior and in
the Cascade foothills. HeatRisk will be moderate over the interior
from about Everett southward as well as in the Cascade foothills.
Low temperatures dropping into the 50s Sunday and Monday morning
will help keep the HeatRisk below advisory levels.

Upper level ridge weakening over the area Monday with the
thermally induced trough moving east of the Cascades late in the
day. High temperatures cooling 5 to 10 degrees along the coast and
up to 5 degrees inland. Still highs well above normal with mid
70s to mid 80s over the interior. Highs in the 60s on the coast.

Temperatures continue to cool Tuesday and Wednesday as the ridge
overhead continues to weaken and a weak upper level trough
approaches Wednesday. Low level flow onshore dropping highs back
into the 70s over the interior with 60s continuing along the
coast. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure offshore is maintaining onshore flow
across the region this morning. Another round of low stratus and fog
is filling on both sides of the Olympic Peninsula, as well as an
area of stratus building back from the Cascades. While surface winds
remain generally light, expect fairly extensive IFR conditions
across the region, impacting most terminals. Expect this stratus to
lift and scatter for most of the interior in the 18-19z range, but
persist along the coast closer to 20-21z. Winds will become
northerly through the Puget Sound terminals later this morning
through the day, increasing to 7-10 kt this afternoon after 21z.


KSEA...VFR conditions early this morning, but expect stratus to build
back in by 12z. Most likely ceiling is around 2000ft, but around a
15% chance of IFR conditions appearing at times.  Southerly wind
will become variable but remain rather light for the next few hours,
before becoming northerly by 16z. North winds increase later today
with low clouds scattering out. Expect winds reaching the 7-10 kt
range this afternoon after 21z through the evening.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure will remain over the coastal waters
into next week. A thermally induced surface trough will move up
the coastline Saturday night then shift over the inland waters
Sunday and east of the area on Monday.

Brief round of small craft westerlies in the Central Strait of
Juan de Fuca tonight. Small craft advisory for the outer coastal
waters beginning tonight through at least Friday night for choppy
seas of 10 or 11 feet with 9 to 11 second periods. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
