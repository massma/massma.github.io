Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
254 PM PDT Mon Jul 22 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low continues to spin in the Gulf of
Alaska, bringing onshore flow and cloudy conditions in the
mornings. Temperatures are expected to break out in the 70s for
much of the region once the clouds scatter throughout much of the
week. A very slight chance of rain lingers in the North Cascades
on Wednesday, but the rest of the area will miss out on any
precipitation.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>For the next few days,
the low offshore with high pressure to the east won`t move too
much. Onshore flow will continue with clouds in the morning and
afternoon sun. Tonight, a shortwave disturbance will move off the
parent low offshore and bring about another round of morning
clouds into Tuesday. Another shortwave will bring similar results
into Wednesday morning. This will be beneficial for overnight
relative humidity recoveries across Puget Sound and in the
Cascades where there are some fires burning as a result of recent
lightning strikes.

An onshore flow push this evening will elevate the winds in areas
north of Everett as they come through the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
Lows tonight will be in the 40s and 50s. Highs will be in the mid
to upper 70s through Thursday, which is definitely in contrast to
the recent string of 80 plus degree days. Additionally, with the
amount of fires burning in the area and to the north in British
Columbia, there is likely to be some smoke aloft. Onshore flow
will move it east, but it could still be present in the absence of
stronger flow.

Most of the deterministic and the ensemble members show the core
of the offshore low moving onshore on Thursday. As of now, there
are some PoPs between 15 and 30 percent from Snohomish county
north to the border. The North Cascades National park likely has
the best chance of seeing precipitation, but at this time, does
not look to be more than 0.01 to 0.02 inches of rain.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Northwesterly flow aloft will
resume in the wake of the low departing to the east Friday into
the weekend. Expect less onshore flow and fewer clouds to start
the mornings from Friday onward. A ridge offshore begins to build
in, nudging the temperatures up closer to the low 80s into
Saturday and Sunday.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough will continue to dig southward
over the northeastern Pacific into Tuesday, promoting southwest to
westerly flow aloft over western Washington. Low level onshore
flow will continue at the surface and will become moderate to
strong heading into this evening. Satellite this afternoon still
shows stratus draped across much of the interior of western
Washington. Stratus has started to lift, however ceilings at many
terminals remain MVFR under stratus this afternoon. Ceilings will
continue to lift over the next several hours, however do expect a
BKN to OVC layer to linger over portions of the Sound today. Ceilings
will likely remain lower in the vicinity of KPAE where a
convergence zone is expected to develop and light shower activity
will be possible into Tuesday morning. The CZ then looks to shift
southward this evening and impact KSEA and KBFI.

KSEA...Ceilings trending towards VFR with terminal under stratus.
Expect stratus to slowly lift over the next few hours, however
could see ceilings trend closer to MVFR again as a CZ moves
southward. Surface winds S/SW persisting at 5-10 kt, then veering
to N/NW this evening, most likely between 01-03Z tonight.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow will continue through much of the week with
high pressure situated over the offshore waters and lower pressure
situated east of the Cascades. A series of weak troughs moving into
British Columbia will increase onshore flow at times over the next
several days.

Another strong onshore push of westerlies is expected along the
central and eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca late this afternoon and
evening, with probabilistic guidance remaining in good agreement
that frequent gusts will be 34 kt or greater. Small craft advisory
strength northwesterlies are expected in the adjacent waters of
Admiralty Inlet for a period this evening as well. Additional
onshore pushes of westerly winds are likely along the Strait over
the next several days and could yield additional headlines at
times.

Seas are generally persisting at 3-5 ft across the coastal waters
this afternoon and look to persist within this range through much
of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
