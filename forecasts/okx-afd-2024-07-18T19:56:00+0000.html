Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
356 PM EDT Thu Jul 18 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure builds in from the west tonight and remains over
the region into Saturday. High pressure weakens over the area
early in the week as a stationary front over the Mid Atlantic
begins to work slowly north as a warm front. The front is
forecast lift across the area mid week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM FRIDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure builds in from the west tonight as an
upper trough moves east and heights slowly rise. Skies will be
clearing through the night, and a light northerly flow will
diminish, becoming light and variable at a few locations. And
dew points will be slowly fall into the mid to upper 50s
overnight, with weak cold advection. This combination will allow
temperatures to drop to a few degrees below seasonal normals.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM FRIDAY MORNING THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The upper trough lifts north of the area during Friday, with a
light westerly flow through Saturday. Meanwhile the surface
high will remain over the region Friday into Saturday, and begin
to weaken late Saturday as a cold front begins to approach to
the north. A relatively dry airmass remains through Friday
night, and then dew points begin to increase into the lower to
mid 60s during Saturday. Temperatures Friday through Saturday
will be near seasonal normals.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper trough across eastern Canada and the Northeast gradually
lifts out to the north through mid week, while a weaker trough over
the mid section of the country amplifies as jet energy dives south
from central Canada. This will allow for backing of the upper flow,
sending a stationary front across the Mid Atlantic northward and
into the area by midweek.

Airmass during this time gradually destabilizes as conditions become
increasingly more humid with an onshore shore S/SE flow.
Temperatures will start off slightly above normal, however, with a
forecast increase in cloud cover and showers and thunderstorms,
highs will be a bit lower by mid week. Generally looking for highs
in the mid and upper 80s, except cooler along the immediate coast.
Lows are forecast to me in the 60s inland, to the lower 70s along
the coast.

The best chance for showers and thunderstorms looks to be Tuesday
afternoon into Wednesday as the warm front approaches from the
south. Before then though, focus may be along an inverted/thermal
trough from the Mid Atlantic states northward into western portions
of the area along with some shortwave energy in the westerlies.
Chances are low on Saturday night and again Monday/Monday night.
PWATs are forecast to increase to around 2 inches by mid week, thus,
heavy rain become more likely with any convection later in the
period. However, it is much too early to be specific with any
details. Frontal timing and location will will be critical.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
