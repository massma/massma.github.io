Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
215 PM PST Sun Dec 1 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will continue to amplify into western
Washington into early this week, allowing for dry conditions and
periods of morning fog and low stratus. The upper ridge will
weaken towards the middle of next week as the next storm system
approaches, bringing in the next chance for widespread
precipitation across the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Dry and stable
conditions prevail across western WA with high pressure over the
region. Calm winds will lead to more fog overnight with dense fog
possible during the Monday morning commute. Freezing fog also
possible across the south sound. A slow burn-off is expected by
the late morning and afternoon. Little overall change to the
conditions moving toward midweek with high pressure still in
control. Expect more late night and morning fog with cool temps in
the 30s. Highs will track in the 40s and lower 50s each day. 33

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...A weak disturbance
overrides the ridge by Thursday for a chance of rain. The air
mass will be warmer with temperatures remaining above freezing
(and highs in the 40s to lower 50s). Snow levels remain high
around 6000 ft. A warm front moves in on Friday for another shot
of rain. The air mass will moderate further with temps in the
lower to mid 50s. A cold front cuts S/SE through western WA on
Saturday for more rain and high elevation snow. Rivers will see
rises but flooding is not expected. We start to dry out again
early next week as another ridge moves in. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure offshore will continue to strengthen under
an upper-level ridge tonight into Monday. This will keep the flow
aloft northwesterly, with surface flow lightly offshore. Majority of
terminals are seeing VFR conditions with high cirrus clouds and
light north winds under 5 kt this afternoon. A couple pockets of low
stratus are quickly burning off at KOLM and KCLM - and should be
clear by 22-23Z. Widespread LIFR fog or stratus remains on track to
impact a majority of terminals late tonight into Monday morning. It
is expected to begin in the Southwest Interior shortly after sunset
(where low stratus currently resides in the I-5 corridor south of
Olympia), and spread north up to the Canadian border around 12Z,
including all of Puget Sound, Cascades, Olympics, Hood Canal and
Northwest Interior areas. Visibilities may be as low as a quarter
mile or less at times. Clearing will take place between 18-21Z
Monday with clear skies returning in the afternoon. Winds will be
variable Monday morning before picking up out of the north at 5 kt
in the afternoon.

KSEA...High clouds/VFR conditions through this afternoon with light
north/northeast winds at around 5 kt. High confidence that fog will
impact the terminal again tonight into Monday morning, beginning as
early as 10Z and lasting through 18Z. Visibilities will be down to a
quarter of a mile or less at times. Once the fog clears, VFR/mostly
clear skies will take place for the afternoon. Winds will be more
variable Monday morning, but will become northerly at 5 kt again in
the afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure offshore over the coastal waters will
continue to build tonight into Monday under a ridge. Winds next few
days will be very light at 5 kt or less at a variable or northerly
direction. Widespread fog over most of the inner waterways is
expected tonight into Monday morning (with visibilities potentially
dropping to 1/2 mile or less in some spots). The fog risk will
continue the next few days until a disturbance approaches the region
around Thursday. This will bring the next chance of precipitation
into the region, along with the potential for gusty winds affecting
small craft in the coastal waters, and into some of the inner waters
next weekend.

Seas at 7 to 9 feet today will decrease to 5 to 6 feet Monday into
Thursday, increasing to 7 to 9 feet Thursday into the weekend.
