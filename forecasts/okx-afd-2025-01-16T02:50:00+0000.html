Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
950 PM EST Wed Jan 15 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure over the region gradually weakens tonight. The
high gives way to a weakening frontal system that approaches
from the west Thursday and passes across the area Thursday
night. High pressure returns Friday. A weak frontal system
passes on Saturday, followed by another system late Sunday. An
arctic high then builds towards the region during the beginning
of next week.

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM THURSDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Lowered min Ts tonight a few degrees in the LoHud Valley where
winds have lightened enough to allow KMGJ to already drop into
the mid teens. Otherwise, forecast on track and previous
discussion follows.

High pressure remains over the region tonight with the strong
and gusty northwest flow diminishing. Any flurries that may be
on- going across portions of the lower Hudson Valley and into
southwestern Connecticut will be ending as the winds diminish
and weak upper energy slides south and east. Have maintained a
mostly clear to clear sky condition through tonight with the dry
airmass in place, and as any strato cu dissipate early this
evening. The NBM deterministic and MAV guidance were used for
low temperatures and dew points.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM THURSDAY MORNING THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/...
Thursday begins with tranquil conditions as in place high
pressure begins to slide offshore as the next shortwave and
upper trough digs to the west. The forecast remains mainly on
track as a weak surface low develops near the Delmarva by late
in the day with little associated moisture. While the NBM
remains dry with the low, CAMs do develop snow showers by late
in the day and into Thursday night as the low rather quickly
moves south of Long Island. With light precipitation possible
have maintained low chance and slight chance probabilities late
Thursday into late Thursday night. Despite winds becoming west
to southwest warm advection is negligible, and with the cold
airmass in place and increasing cloud cover Thursday`s highs
will be similar to Wednesday`s and once again blended the NBM
deterministic and MAV guidance. With the possibility of a light
dusting of snow have added QPF. late Thursday and Thursday
night.

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
Fair wx is expected on Fri as an h5 ridge transitions into the
region. This ridge will then slide offshore as a deep upr trof digs
into the cntrl CONUS. Moisture advection and lowering heights on Sat
will produce chcs for pcpn late Sat and Sat ngt. Rain attm for much
of the area with a mix interior with the arctic air yet to build in.
There could be some mixing or a changeover before the pcpn ends as
the cold air advects in. Although pcpn is expected to be mainly lgt
and therefore significant accums are not expected, there could be
some refreezing issues on roads etc Sat ngt. Another weak low
develops invof the polar front late Sun and Sun ngt. This would
produce some snow across the area, with a general 1-3 or 2-4 type
event. This is dependent on the position/timing of the sys, and the
blended NBM pops yield roughly 30-50 percent at this stage. This
seems reasonable at this time scale so did not stray from the NBM.
Arctic air then builds in for the beginning of next week. Dry wx
unless a stray flurry from the lakes reaches the cwa. Highs in many
places on Tue likely to stay in the teens.

.AVIATION /03Z THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure gradually builds in tonight and moves offshore
Thursday. A frontal system approaches from the west late in the
TAF period.

VFR conditions expected through Thursday afternoon.

Gusts diminish by late this evening as flow becomes more westerly
into Thursday morning, then SW into the afternoon. Gusts toward
20 kt may return at some terminals Thursday afternoon, though
also may be more occasional. Winds veer westerly again Thursday
night, then NW into early Friday morning.

A few snow showers are possible Thursday evening, and have added
a PROB30 to highlight this potential, as well as MVFR cigs and
vsbys. Little to no accumulation expected. Brief IFR conds
can`t be ruled out, generally between 22Z Thu and 3Z Fri or so.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Gusts Thursday afternoon may be more occasional.

Snow shower timing Thursday evening may be off by an hour or
two. Brief IFR conds possible.

.OUTLOOK FOR 18Z THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY...

Thursday: Mainly VFR. Occasional SW wind gusts 15-20 kt possible
afternoon. Light snow showers possible, mainly early evening
with MVFR or lower possible.

Friday: Mainly VFR.

Saturday: MVFR or lower at times with rain likely, possible snow at
night. SW wind gusts 15-20 kt during the day.

Sunday: Chance for MVFR or lower at times with increasing
chances of snow, with rain/snow mix for coastal terminals day
into early evening.

Monday: Mainly VFR. Possible snow early with MVFR or lower possible.
NW wind gusts near 20 kt.

.MARINE...
Winds and seas will gradually diminish tngt. Once conditions
improve on the non ocean waters this evening sub advisory
conditions continue into Thursday night as high pressure weakens
with a weak frontal system passing through the waters Thursday
night. For the ocean waters conditions fall below advisory soon
after midnight tonight, and then remain below through Thursday
night.

Winds and seas are expected to remain blw sca lvls on Fri, then
cond on the ocean may ramp up to sca lvls on Sat with a sys
moving thru. As low pres strengthens over the ocean, seas build
to sca lvls on the ocean Sun. All areas may hit sca or gale in
strong NW flow on Mon as arctic air builds in.

No hydrologic impacts are expected into early next week.
