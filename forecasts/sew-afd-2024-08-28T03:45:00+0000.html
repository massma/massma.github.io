Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
845 PM PDT Tue Aug 27 2024

.SYNOPSIS...High pressure will start to build over western
Washington, leading to a warming and drying trend into the weekend.
Daytime highs will remain mild Wednesday but will ramp up quickly to
above normal temperatures Thursday and into the weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...Earlier convergence zone
activity has wound down and as such, current radar is generally
clear. Satellite imagery shows some flat cumulus scattered here and
there with plenty of peeks of blue sky. High pressure still slated
to start building into the area Wednesday with relatively mild
daytime highs expected to be a few degrees below normal. Mother
nature apparently does not do transition material, and highs
Thursday will already be above normal with that trend continuing
into the weekend.

Inherited forecast remains on track and as such, no evening update
is needed. For additional forecast details, please refer to the
Previous Discussion section below.

From Previous Discussion...Recent radar imagery shows convergence
zone activity still continuing mainly around the King/Snohomish
county line, with showers in and around the zone. Thunderstorm
activity have been observed this afternoon around the Puget Sound
Convergence Zone, with a few bouts of lightning here and there. PSCZ
activity will continue to steer southward towards Pierce county into
this evening, with again chances of showers and possibility a
lightning strike or two. Again, most of the precipitation will be
mainly in the Cascades, but cannot rule out a couple of potential
showers near the zone this evening. With any thunderstorm that
develops, lightning, small hail, and brief heavy downpours are the
primary hazards. Shower activity will decrease throughout the
remainder of the evening, along with any thunderstorm threat. High
temperatures this afternoon will top out in the mid to upper 60s
across the interior, and lower 60s along the coastal regions.

Conditions will begin to dry out tonight as a high pressure begins
to build offshore with higher upper level heights. With residual
surface moisture and mostly clear skies by tonight, can likely see
some patchy fog across the region early Wednesday morning.

Warmer and drier conditions will prevail throughout the short
term as upper level ridging continues over western Washington.
Temperatures will warm into the low 70s by Wednesday, and into the
upper 70s and lower 80s Thursday and Friday. What a way to end
August!

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...From Previous
Discussion...Ensemble guidance continues to highlight the
aforementioned upper level ridge starting to break down by Sunday,
with a weak trough sliding northward near our region by the
beginning of next week. There is some uncertainty regarding the
exact placement and intensity of this feature, which may result in
differences in temperatures and precipitation chances. As of now,
confidence is low in any particular detail, but will continue to
monitor the trends.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow will strengthen as an upper level
trough of low pressure moves east of the region through the period.
Shower activity has come to an end but satellite imagery shows a few
lingering clouds across the area this evening. Conditions will
remain VFR through the overnight hours with some patchy MVFR to IFR
cigs returning towards daybreak, especially along the coast and in
favored locations. Any development of lowered cigs will dissipate by
18Z and give way to VFR conditions. Winds will remain less than 10
kts through the period.

KSEA...Lingering clouds along a decaying PCSZ this evening will
drift south through the terminals through 06Z. Should remain VFR
with cigs briefly BKN around 5kft. This will give way to VFR cigs
and winds diminishing and shifting southerly 4-6kts after 06z Wed.
With clear skies and generally light winds may see development of
some localized lower cloud cigs generally 11-16Z timeframe. While
VFR should prevail, there is a low probability for MVFR cigs
depending on how well these clouds develop around daybreak. Whatever
does develop should give way to VFR conditions by 18Z again and
winds should return more northerly at about 8-10 kts on Wed
afternoon end evening.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Winds continue to diminish this evening and so the
small craft advisory should be allowed to expire at 11 PM as
expected. Onshore flow will relax tonight into Wednesday as broad
surface ridging rebuilds over the offshore and coastal waters.
Thermally induced low pressure will then expand northward along the
Oregon and Washington coast Thursday through Saturday, turning the
flow northerly. Winds are expected to remain generally under
advisory levels across area waters with the exception of perhaps the
southern outer coastal waters.   Cullen/LJ<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
