Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
906 AM PDT Sat Mar 15 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Additional systems today through Monday will keep
lowland rain, steady mountain snowfall, and occasionally breezy
conditions in the forecast throughout the weekend. Drier, benign
weather is expected early next week before active weather returns
midweek.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Lowland rain, mountain snow,
and breezy winds will continue today as a system traverses the
region. Radar shows steadier precipitation tracking northeastward
across the northern Sound this morning, with more showery precipitation
moving inland along the coast and into the south and central
Sound. A few lightning strikes have already been observed in some
convective showers offshore. Main threats with any thunderstorms
today will be small hail, gusty winds, and lightning. Southerly
winds have also been breezy across western Washington this
morning. Expect most areas to see wind gusts of 20-35 mph, with
winds expected to peak early this afternoon and gradually ease
into this evening. A few localized spots from Tacoma to Everett
could see some higher gusts between 35-45 mph, mainly for areas
closer to the water.

The remainder of the previous discussion follows below, with
updates made to the marine and aviation sections. 14

Steadier rain will transition to scattered showers this afternoon.
A Winter Storm Warning continues for the Cascades until Sunday
morning. The heavier accumulations are to be expected today into
Sunday, with lighter snowfall amounts to continue through Monday.
Snow levels generally around 2000 to 2500 through the weekend.

With upper level troughing passing by overhead, there is some
support for a chance of a thunderstorm or two this afternoon and
evening, especially over the coast and southern Puget Sound. HREF
probabilities for isolated lightning ranges from 40-60%, mainly
focused along the coastal areas, and some localized areas in the
Cascades.

Widespread showers will continue into Sunday as the broad upper
level trough passes by western Washington. This may support
another chance of an isolated thunderstorm or two across most of
the interior. The highest chances of lightning seem to be focused
on the coast once again.

High temperatures across most of the interior will remain in the
upper 40s to lower 50s throughout the weekend, with lows in the
upper 30s dipping into the mid 30s to kick off the week. Snow
levels Monday look to lower around 1500 feet, with snowfall
continuing through the mountains and scattered showers in the
lowlands.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Somewhat drier conditions
are possible Tuesday through Wednesday as a weak ridge builds
over the area. Ensemble members then show support for wetter and
cooler conditions to return later in the week, with active weather
back on tap.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow will increase aloft through today with a
broad upper level trough across the Pacific Northwest. Showers will
continue through today, with a slight chance of thunderstorms as
well (mainly 10-20% probabilities) due to a somewhat unstable
airmass. Generally a mix of VFR/MVFR cigs this morning. Cigs will
primarily be VFR/MVFR through this afternoon, with the better chance
for MVFR cigs during showers. Another upper disturbance will bring
another round of rain showers tonight. Cigs tonight into Sunday
morning will lower again into MVFR/IFR for most areas. Gusty
southwesterly surface winds will continue into early afternoon
before easing later this evening.

.KSEA...MVFR cigs expected to continue into early afternoon. Some
lifting towards low-end VFR possible between 21z to 03z before cigs
drop back to MVFR again. However, MVFR cigs may occur at times this
afternoon, especially in any shower. Cigs may lower into IFR after
09-10z tonight. Gusty S/SW surface winds ranging 20-30 knots through
21z will gradually east later this afternoon and evening. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface low near Cape Disappointment will weaken as
it slowly moves inland this morning. Increasing onshore flow in its
wake will continue to lead to small craft advisory conditions across
the coastal waters, west/central portions of the strait, and Puget
Sound/Hood Canal. A Small Craft Advisory has also been issued for
the northern inland waters for late morning through the afternoon
due to increase south to southwest winds. Brief SCA wind gusts are
also possible for the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca.

A secondary weak surface low will move onshore over the north Oregon
coast late tonight, but will produce minimal wind impacts to area
waters. Weak troughing will remain over area waters into Monday
before a surface ridge builds across the waters into Tuesday.
Another front will approach the coastal waters around the middle of
the coming week.

Combined seas will build back into double digits this weekend over
the coastal waters before subsiding below 10 feet early next week.
The return of more active weather by the middle of the coming week
will likely produce more headlines for wind and/or hazardous seas.

.HYDROLOGY...Forecast precipitation through the weekend has
continued to come down somewhat with the significant amounts
expected well to the south of the area. There remains a small
chance of the plume of deeper moisture shifting northward, and
have left the ESF over Mason County in effect. Regardless,
precipitation over the southern Olympics this weekend will result
in rises on the Skokomish River. Current projections bring the
Skokomish River into action stage early Sunday. While other rivers
will experience rising water levels, river flooding is not
expected elsewhere over the next 7 days.
