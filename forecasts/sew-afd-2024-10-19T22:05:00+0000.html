Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
305 PM PDT Sat Oct 19 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An atmospheric river continues to bring moderate to
localized heavy rainfall across portions of Western Washington. A
front will move across the area on Sunday for additional breezy
winds and rain. Troughing overhead Monday for additional showers
and cooler temperatures. Drier weather later Tuesday into midweek,
with another system late week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Steady, heavier rainfall
continues this afternoon across the Olympic Peninsula, as well as
the central and northern Cascades with the ongoing atmospheric
river focused on northern WA into BC. Impressive rainfall amounts
of 2 to 5 inches observed across portions of the Olympics, as
well as North Cascades, particularly over Whatcom County. In
addition, the rain shadow is in full effect across Puget Sound,
with 0.10 of an inch or less from Tacoma to Everett. The steadiest
rain will remain focused on the Olympics and North Cascades
through this evening before shifting northward further into BC
later tonight into Sunday morning. A frontal system will then move
across Western Washington on Sunday for additional rainfall.
Winds will also slowly taper off tonight, but increase again
Sunday morning. HREF suggests 60 to 90% probabilities of gusts
exceeding 45 MPH across the north coast, as well as Admiralty
Inlet, San Juan Islands, and western Whatcom/Skagit Counties on
Sunday. For this reason, another Wind Advisory has been issued for
these areas. Localized power outages and tree damage is possible.
However, the stronger southerly winds will be relatively brief,
at least compared to the previous 24 hours. Elsewhere, breezy
conditions are expected, with gusts ranging 20 to 40 MPH. The
front will move east of the Cascades into later Sunday evening,
with lingering convergence zone activity across portions of
Snohomish and northern King Counties.

Troughing will move overhead and weaken on Monday for continued
unsettled weather and lingering showers for the area. In addition,
temperatures will drop 10-15 degrees for most areas on Monday,
with highs only in the mid 50s. Snow levels Monday will be
4000-5000 feet. A few showers may lingering into Tuesday,
especially during the morning, with more split flow aloft.
Otherwise, drier conditions expected into the afternoon with some
sunshine.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Dry weather expected to
continue on Wednesday with light southwest flow aloft.
Temperatures will also remain relatively cool, especially during
the overnight periods, with lows Wednesday and Thursday in the mid
to upper 30s, mainly away from the water. Uncertainty increases
later Thursday into next weekend regarding the influence of
troughing offshore. However, precipitation potential does look to
increase again later Thursday into Friday, and continue into next
weekend. Temperatures look to remain a few degrees cooler than
normal into late next week. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface cold front is currently sitting just offshore,
with strong westerly flow aloft ahead of an incoming trough. Rain
continues today, primarily over the northwest portions of the area,
with off-and-on showers elsewhere. Ceilings are largely MVFR and VFR
with IFR conditions along the coast this afternoon where
visibilities have been restricted to 2-3 SM at times. Ceilings
should briefly lift to VFR low-end VFR in the Seattle metro this
afternoon, with MVFR conditions remaining through the north
interior, and IFR conditions remaining along the coast for most of
the TAF period as the front remains stalled just to the northwest of
the region. Gusty winds from the southwest remain with winds 10 to
15 kt with gusts up to 25 kt. For BLI and CLM, winds 15 to 25 kt
with gusts 35 to 40 kt. Winds will slowly ease tonight down to 5 to
10 kt area-wide tonight. The cold front is expected to make its way
through western Washington tomorrow morning, so there will be an
uptick in surface wind speeds between 15Z-18Z, lingering into the
early afternoon as it passes. LLWS will be monitored for inclusion
in the TAF if needed.

KSEA...VFR cigs are present at the terminal this afternoon, with
gusty southerlies in the 20 to 25 kt range. Breezy conditions will
prevail into this evening, relaxing after 03Z. Rain is expected
after 03Z lasting until 06Z-07Z. The cold front offshore is expected
to move over the area tomorrow morning, with an uptick in surface
winds expected around 17Z with gusts of 20 to 25 kt likely again
into the early afternoon. LLWS is possible with the frontal passage
and will be included in the TAF if conditions are supportive of
airspeed gains or losses.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front remains just to the northwest of the coastal
waters today, sending heavy rains and gusty winds throughout the
region. Small Craft Advisory winds continue to prevail across all
area waters this afternoon, with the strongest gusts across the
Northern Inland Waters, through Admiralty Inlet and also the
northern portions of the Puget Sound and Hood Canal. Winds will
begin to ease this afternoon, allowing the advisories for the
interior waters to expire this afternoon.

Winds will pick up again across the area on Sunday as a cold front
sweeps across the area; additional headlines will likely be
necessary for the inland waters on Sunday. The Small Craft Advisory
has been extended through Sunday afternoon for the coastal waters. A
push of westerlies down the Strait of Juan de Fuca will pick up
following the frontal passage Sunday afternoon, with the strongest
winds persisting through the east entrance Sunday evening. Another
round of small craft advisories will be posted for Sunday afternoon
to cover the post frontal winds. High pressure will build into early
next week, allowing winds to ease for more tranquil conditions.

Seas 10 to 12 ft will continue through tonight, for which a Small
Craft Advisory remains in effect for the coastal waters, West
Strait, and Grays Harbor Bar through early tonight. Seas will begin
to subside on Sunday and through the beginning of the week, down to
3 to 5 ft by Tuesday and remain like so through the week.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The first atmospheric river of the fall season
continues to bring periods of moderate to heavy rainfall to
western Washington. Sharp rises on area rivers continues, with
the heaviest rainfall over the last 24 hours focused on the
Olympic Peninsula, as well as the north Cascades. Approximately 3
to 5 inches of rain has been observed over the western Olympics,
with 1 to 4 inches over the North Cascades. Additional rainfall
amounts of 1 to 3 inches expected for these areas through Monday,
with lighter QPF elsewhere. Rises on area rivers has been
observed due to this rainfall. River forecast models continue to
keep river flows below minor flood throughout the weekend.
However, we will have to continue to monitor rivers flowing off
the western Olympics, particularly the Bogachiel River, due to
continued heavy rain.

It is important to note the river forecast models often struggle
with the first event of the wet season in terms of balancing
runoff and river flow losses going overbank, so overall conditions
will continue to be closely monitored.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
