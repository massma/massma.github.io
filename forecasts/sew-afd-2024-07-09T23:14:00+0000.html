Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
414 PM PDT Tue Jul 9 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Very hot and dry conditions continue today across the
region as the upper level ridge remains over the area. Thermal low
pressure will shift eastward today, bringing increased onshore
low level winds to the coast by tonight. This brings some cooler
temperatures for many over the next two days, but still well above
normal. High pressure remains over the region with high temperatures
remaining above normal through early next week.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>One last very hot afternoon
across Western Washington with several records for the date
reached this afternoon. With the upper level ridge axis as well as
the thermal low pressure shifting eastward through the day,
expect some increased onshore flow tonight. This will likely be
enough to bring some cooling to areas closer to the coast, but
this will not be a deep enough push into the interior. As a
result, still expect one more fairly warm day tomorrow with
temperatures around Seattle again climbing to around 90 degrees
for one last day. Similarly places in the Cascade valleys and
foothills will again be quite warm before a stronger marine push
Wednesday night into Thursday. This will result in the coolest day
of the week Thursday, but this is relative as afternoon highs
likely still climb into the mid 80s inland (or about 7-10 degrees
above normal). Heights rise a bit into Friday with temperatures
again climbing toward the upper 80s and a return of moderate
(Orange) HeatRisk that will continue into the weekend.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Warm temperatures are
favored to continue this weekend through early next week as
western Washington remains on the periphery of a strong ridge
drifting eastward over the southern US. While light onshore flow
will keep the coast in the low 70s, areas inland will see highs in
the mid to upper 80s, corresponding to moderate HeatRisk. Ensembles
remain in good agreement that no precipitation is likely through
the next week or beyond.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong upper ridge axis continues to gradually shift
east of the region with southwesterly flow aloft. Surface flow is
currently northerly with speeds mainly 4-8 kts...although coastal
locations may see speeds ranging 10-15 kts. VFR conditions in place
and expected to persist for most terminals throughout the TAF
period. However, increasing onshore flow tonight will bring IFR/LIFR
stratus to coastal areas, such as HQM, by around 06Z tonight.
Stratus will spread locally inland tonight to around SHN by sunrise
on Wednesday. VFR conditions expected to resume for these locations
by Wednesday afternoon.

KSEA...Clear skies. Surface winds generally N/NW 5 to 9 knots
backing to light S/SW after 09Z Wednesday morning. North to
northwesterly winds to resume in the mid-afternoon. 18<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Broad surface ridging over the coastal and offshore waters
will remain in place through the week. Thermally induced low
pressure over the interior of Western Washington will shift
eastward tonight resulting in an increase in onshore flow for the
second half of the week. Small craft advisory westerlies are
expected in the central/east strait late this afternoon and tonight,
and as such headline in place there will remain unaltered. A weak
weather system passing well to the north of the area will increase
the onshore flow further on Wednesday with gale force westerlies a
strong possibility in the central/east strait Wednesday evening.
Models remain consistent in bringing low-end gales into this area,
however would be more confident in upgrading to warning if current
headline pans out. As such, will hold off and allow future shifts to
make the decision. A fairly static summer onshore flow pattern
remains Thursday into the weekend for diurnally driven increases in
the westerlies in the strait and occasional small craft advisory
winds/seas over portions of the coastal waters.

Seas generally 4 to 6 ft today and Wednesday before increasing to 6
to 8 ft Thursday. 18<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Another dry and hot day for the interior. Instability
over the Cascades will result in critical fire weather conditions and
a Red Flag Warning remains in effect today for the Cascades. For the
lower elevations of the central and southern Puget Sound relative humidity
values could get as low as the teens late this afternoon. Onshore
flow will bring higher humidities beginning Wednesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
