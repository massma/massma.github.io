Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
258 PM PDT Thu Sep 5 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Hot and dry weather will continue in Western
Washington Thursday afternoon through Friday as strong high
pressure moves through. High temperatures will range from the mid
80s into the mid 90s, resulting in widespread moderate heat risk.
Onshore flow will slowly return this weekend into next week,
bringing temperatures to around average. Next week remains mostly
dry, with a chance of showers Tuesday through Thursday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A large upper level ridge
has centered over Western Washington this afternoon. This extends
from California deep into Canada. A thermal trough also remains
under the ridge. Flow aloft has become lightly offshore,
resulting in the loss of cool air from the oceans inland, and in
many cases, a "chinook" effect (east winds warming the air
adiabatically, descending in elevation down the slopes of the
Cascades and Olympics).

Skies remain clear over Western Washington this afternoon, and
satellite shows a little bit of haze making it northward into
Washington (from fires in Oregon). Regardless of the haze,
temperatures have had no problem climbing into the 80s and 90s
today, and still continue to climb this afternoon. The warmest
temperatures have been areas away from waters, and also in valley
areas within slopes of the Cascades and Olympics. A few of these
areas have reached the mid 90s. The lows tonight will only drop
into the 60s for all areas (again, warmer temperatures inland
towards the mountain foothills).

HeatRisk is widespread moderate (orange), with pockets of major
(red) in mountain areas) today and tomorrow. With the flow aloft
on Friday expected to remain offshore for most of the day
(eventually turning north/northeasterly Friday evening), the
temperatures will remain hot for all areas. Highs are still
expected to climb into the mid 80s and mid 90s Friday. With the
warmer temperatures (in this update) for the coastal areas
tomorrow (along with the increase in moderate HeatRisk), the heat
advisory was extended to 11 PM tomorrow night (along with Puget
Sound, Olympics, Cascades, and South Interior). In addition, upper
level haze from wildfires in Oregon may become more widespread
Friday (does not appear it will drop temperatures significantly).

The flow Saturday will become more northerly Saturday as the ridge
breaks down, and slides eastward (along with the thermal trough).
High pressure will build off the Pacific, which will return
onshore flow from the ocean. This will be slow to start Saturday
(with highs still in the 80s to low 90s). Sunday continues to cool
down with highs in the 70s to low 80s. Northerly winds Saturday
will become southwesterly Sunday. A few more clouds will also move
in Saturday afternoon into Sunday morning.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Next week will be a
completely different story to the end of this week. Monday is
expected to remain dry. However clouds will begin filling in as a
trough pattern is expected to take shape late Monday into
Wednesday. A frontal system is expected to bring rain showers
Tuesday into Thursday. These are expected to remain light (not
producing any significant precipitation). Temperatures will return
to average (and even below average) with highs dropping through
the week from the 70s, into the mid and upper 60s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper ridge will continue to be located over the area
through tonight with low level offshore flow. Southerly flow aloft
is expected through Friday. VFR conditions with clear skies are
expected through the period. Localized fog may develop over interior
river valleys briefly Friday morning, but not expected at this time.
Elevated haze will increase across Western Washington into Friday
due to regional fires in OR/WA. N/NW winds will continue this
afternoon, becoming lighter N/NE tonight.

KSEA...VFR conditions with clear skies. Elevated haze will increase
into Friday due to ongoing wildfires in OR/WA. North winds ranging 6
to 9 kts will continue through this evening, before tapering to 4 to
7 kts tonight. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure remains over Western Washington into Friday
for continued offshore, easterly flow over the interior waters, and
northerly winds for the Coastal Waters. Onshore flow returns Friday
evening with the thermal trough exiting the area. Northwesterly
winds will increase Friday night into early Saturday for the Outer
Coastal Waters, with brief Small Craft Advisory gusts possible, but
headline conditions are not expected to be widespread at this time.
In addition, westerly winds will increase through the Strait of Juan
de Fuca Saturday evening. Onshore flow will then continue into next
week as a weather system moves across the area.

Seas generally 5 to 7 feet through the weekend before decreasing to
3 to 5 feet Sunday night into Monday. Shorter periods and more wind
driven seas, especially later Friday through Friday night are
expected, perhaps nearing SCA threshold, mainly for the Outer
Coastal Waters. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper-ridging and an associated surface thermal
trough will continue critical fire weather. Hot, dry, and unstable
conditions will remain through Friday afternoon for the Olympic
zones 652/661 and Cascade zones 658/659. A return to onshore flow on
Friday night into Saturday over the Olympic Peninsula will begin to
bring cooler, moist air to the Olympics while the Cascades could
remain warm, dry and unstable unless increasing high cloud coverage
limits the risk. Something we`ll continue to monitor. Easterly winds
are also in the offing. They won`t be overly strong, but a period of
them are possible later tonight into Friday morning, through the
Cascade gaps. Red flag warnings remain in place through tomorrow due
to continued hot, dry and unstable conditions. The RFW for the
Olympics has been extended.

Cooler and more moist air will return area-wide through the weekend
with the potential of some wetting rains by midweek.
