.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Dry and stable air mass over western WA today with
high pressure over the region. VFR conditions expected through
much of the day with cirrus streaming overhead. Few spots of
patchy stratus are present along KHQM this morning, but expect
stratus to lift and scatter in the next hour or two. Surface winds
will generally remain light. Increasing onshore flow tonight into
Sunday will allow for stratus to push further inland tomorrow
morning, with stratus likely making it into the southern Sound
terminals. Conditions likely to lower to MVFR early Sunday for
terminals under stratus.

W/NW. Winds transitioning back to the S/SW to around 5-10 kt
