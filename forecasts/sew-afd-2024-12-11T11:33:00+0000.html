Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
333 AM PST Wed Dec 11 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure through today with dry but cool
conditions. Rain chances then increase this evening through the
weekend as a series of disturbances take aim. Saturday could bring
gusty winds with an increased risk of coastal flooding, particularly
along the Pacific coast. Active weather will trend into early
next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure is persisting
over the PNW currently as its axis cuts through W WA. Conditions
are mostly dry across the CWA but mid to high-level cloud coverage
has maintained, keeping low temperatures relatively warmer than
seen previously and fog at bay. We`ll see a chilly start to the
day with widespread 30s meeting us at the door this morning. Highs
will top out near average with values in the upper 40s to near 50
F. As the day progress, PoPs will increase from west to east as a
trough enters. Most of its energy will focus towards northern CA
but showers are slated to become more prevalent this evening and
into Thursday with snow showers expected at the passes. High
temperatures will cool a couple of degrees on Thursday with mid to
upper 40s expected. Another round of 30s overnight is in store for
Thursday night.


Deterministic guidance is hinting at brief shortwave ridging
early on Friday but, it won`t be enough to keep precip completely
out of the forecast. A more organized disturbance looks to form
offshore on this day as a front enters by the evening hours with
widespread rain, mountain snow and the potential for gusty winds.
High temperatures will be similar to Thursday`s on Friday, with
values in the mid to upper 40s expected. But overnight lows will
be a touch warmer in the lower 40s as surface winds increase
mixing.


.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...As mentioned, a stout
disturbance will enter late Friday into Saturday. NBM
probabilities continue to indicate a 20-30 percent of wind gusts
of 40 mph or higher along the coast and for areas across the
North Interior. Winds will depend on the track of this area of
low pressure, so details will continue to be ironed out as
guidance comes into better focus. Along with wind and
precipitation, coastal flooding will need to monitored throughout
the weekend as astronomical tides peak this weekend into early
next week for coastal areas.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure over the waters will weaken
today. A splitting front will reach the area late tonight into
Thursday bringing small craft advisory winds and seas near 10 feet
to portions of the coastal waters. High pressure will briefly
rebuild Thursday night before a significantly stronger storm
system arrives Saturday. Gales possible over the coastal waters
with small craft advisory winds possible at the entrances to the
Strait of Juan de Fuca, Northern Inland waters and Admiralty
Inlet. High pressure will rebuild over the waters again Sunday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Next round of precipitation with a weak system
Thursday will only result in small rises on the rivers. A stronger
storm will set up along the coast over the weekend with the
potential to bring more significant precipitation to the region.
While area rivers will rise only the Skokomish River is currently
forecast to potentially reach minor flood stage Saturday. Another
round of precipitation early next week could push the Skokomish
river above flood stage. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
