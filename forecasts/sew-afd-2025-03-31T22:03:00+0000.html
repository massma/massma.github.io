Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
303 PM PDT Mon Mar 31 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An area of low pressure offshore will produce
scattered showers across Western Washington tonight. A broad
trough will remain over the area into midweek for a chance of
showers and near seasonal temperatures. High pressure aloft will
build into the region toward the end of the week for dry
conditions and temperatures trending well above normal by the
weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A stacked Pacific low
continues to spin overhead with scattered showers across the
region. Highest instability remains east of the Cascades where a
few thunderstorms are possible. The air mass is cool with snow
levels around 3000 ft. With some clearing, overnight lows will
drop into the 30s and 40s with temps near freezing around the
south sound.

Low pressure shifts inland on Tuesday with onshore flow
increasing. The combination of low pressure and high tide will
lead to higher tidal anomalies. Minor flooding is possible along
the coast and a Coastal Flood Advisory is in effect (around high
tide Tuesday morning - 11z). Showers will mainly impact the
Cascades on Tuesday with a focus toward the central Cascades
during the afternoon and evening due to a convergence zone. This
may lead to light snow Stevens Pass with a rain/snow mix at
Snoqualmie.

A broad trough develops over the West on Wednesday with N/NW flow
over Washington. Weak ripples in the flow keep a chance of showers
in the forecast although most of the activity will likely impact
the Cascades. Snow levels remain low, around 2500-3000 ft,
although heavy snow accumulations are not expected in the
mountains. 33

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...High pressure over the NE
Pacific slowly shifts inland during the second half of the week,
leading to dry and warmer conditions. Temperatures jump a few
degrees each day with highs reaching the lower 70s by Sunday. Rain
returns late Sunday night and Monday as high pressure shifts
farther inland and a weak front moves in from the west. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southerly flow aloft becoming variable as an upper
level low rotates offshore. VFR conditions at all area terminals
this afternoon with some light shower activity across the area.
Could see brief MVFR conditions in these showers, but mostly VFR
will prevail through the evening and into the overnight period.
Southerly winds this afternoon 8 to 12 knots decreasing after
00-02z. Ceilings look to lower into Tuesday morning potentially
around MVFR as guidance suggests a weak convergence zone to
develop.

KSEA...VFR conditions at the terminal this afternoon, with S/SW
winds 8 to 12 knots. Winds will start to ease through the evening.
Ceilings look to possibly lower into Tuesday morning, with a
30-40% chance of reaching MVFR by (13z-16z). A weak convergence
zone looks to develop Tuesday morning/afternoon, but latest
guidance largely pinpoints it north of the terminal.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface low offshore will gradually weaken and move
into Oregon, allowing for southerly winds to ease over the coastal
waters this afternoon. Onshore flow will increase on Tuesday as a
result, where an additional round of small craft strength
advisory winds may be possible. Winds may reach this criteria in
the Central and Eastern Strait of Juan De Fuca, and the outer
coastal water zones Tuesday evening.

Surface high pressure will then build midweek and into the
weekend for more benign conditions.

Coastal seas generally around 6 to 8 feet this afternoon. Seas may
briefly rise to 9 to 10 feet tonight, but will be very brief. Seas
look to hover around 6 to 8 feet on Wednesday, before subsiding to
3 to 5 feet through the end of the week.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The Skokomish River will remain in action stage into
midweek, but overall QPF through the week ahead does not look
sufficient to produce any flood concerns there or along any other
rivers across the region through the upcoming week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SEW WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>WA...Coastal Flood Advisory from 2 AM to 6 AM PDT Tuesday for Grays
     Harbor County Coast-Northern Washington Coast.

PZ...None.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
