Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
348 AM PDT Fri May 16 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cloudy and showery conditions will continue across
the region through the weekend with temperatures remaining below
normal. The chance of thunderstorms will increase to around 20
percent across much of the region Saturday afternoon. Showers
continue through the start of next week as the pattern remains
somewhat active. A shift to somewhat warmer conditions is
possible late next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow continuing
across the region with continued rain in the wake of the passing
frontal system. Moist, westerly flow aloft will continue through
the day today with cloudy and cool conditions continuing.
Another disturbance slides across the region Saturday, with
another round of showers across the area. Instability increases
a bit during the afternoon and evening showers, with around a
20% chance of thunderstorms across portions of the area
(generally south and east of Puget sound, extending through the
Cascades). Snow levels remain somewhat low into Sunday, around
4000 ft or so, and some light snow may fall in the mountains as
a result. However, any accumulations should be light (less than
an inch) and short-lived.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...Heights rise a bit
by early Monday with an upper ridge moving through the region,
bringing a decrease in shower activity. This should also allow
for temperatures to trend back up a couple of degrees, mostly
in the lower 60s. Another front arrives late Monday or Tuesday
for another round of cloudy and showery conditions, along with
breezier winds. Ensemble guidance begins to split later in the
week, with the forecast continuing to reflect modest onshore
flow maintaining clouds and near normal conditions, but the
potential for a slightly warmer and perhaps drier pattern to
emerge by the late stages of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow aloft becoming more westerly Friday
evening. A mix bag of ceilings early this morning as scattered
showers continue to push across the region. Breaks in showers have
allowed some terminals to bounce back into VFR for now; however the
favored trend is for MVFR to persist for the majority of the TAF
period (IFR for the coast). Guidance is hinting at some short-lived
improvement Friday evening/night (between 0z-4z) for Puget Sound
terminals, but confidence is low at this time. If ceilings do lift,
they will rise to around 3500 ft. Shower activity will continue
throughout the day Friday into Saturday. Periods of IFR/LIFR are
possible with the heavier showers. Southerly to southwesterly
surface winds 5 to 10 kt, except KCLM where surface flow will be
more easterly.

KSEA...MVFR is expected to persist for the majority of the TAF
period. There may be some short-lived improvement Friday evening to
low-end VFR, but confidence remains low at this time. IFR is
possible during the heavier bands of showers (15% to 25% chance 12z-
17z Saturday). Southerly to southwesterly surface winds 5 to 7 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system will move over the waters today and
weaken as it moves inland. Surface high pressure will build over the
coastal waters Saturday into Sunday. This will bring increased
onshore flow over the coastal waters and Strait of Juan de Fuca. The
strongest winds will be along the Central and East entrances, and a
Gale Watch has been issued for frequent gusts up to 40 kt for
Saturday night. The next frontal system arrives Monday.

Seas will build to 6-8 ft on Friday and ease slightly on Saturday.
Seas will rebuild on Sunday to 8-10 ft and subside to 5-6 ft on
Monday.
