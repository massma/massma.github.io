Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
246 PM PST Sat Dec 21 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The active pattern continues with multiple frontal
systems moving through the area bringing periods of rain, mountain
snow, and gusty winds. The focus shifts towards Christmas into
late next week with potentially higher-impact systems with heavy
rain and snow and gusty winds, especially when combined with
holiday travel.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light rain continues to work
its way through western Washington this afternoon as an occluded
front moves through the area. Breezy south to southeast winds
accompany this frontal passage, with the strongest winds being
observed along the coast, where a wind advisory remains in effect
until 2 PM this afternoon. Temperatures today hover a few degrees
on either side of 50. A few isolated showers and perhaps a
lightning strike or two will follow behind the front late this
afternoon into tonight. A brief break in the rain is expected
overnight tonight before the next frontal system arrives tomorrow
morning. Tomorrow looks to be almost a repeat of today, with
another round of mostly light rain for the lowlands (more
significant rainfall in the mountains) and breezy southeasterly
winds--strongest along the coast and through the north interior.
There appears to be a bit better chance for a few isolated
thunderstorms Sunday afternoon, but the best chances remain
confined to the Pacific coast. Snow levels will hang around 3500
to 4000 ft this weekend, with light snow accumulation expected at
Stevens and White Pass, but mostly rain at Snoqualmie Pass.

Another brief dry period is expected through most of the day on
Monday before another frontal system moves through Monday night
into Tuesday. The low pressure center will be relatively closer
to the region (near the northwest tip of Vancouver Island), and
with that, gusty east to southeast winds are more probable through
the gaps in the Cascades and through the Strait of Juan de Fuca
overnight Monday into Tuesday. QPF with this system will again be
mostly focused in the mountains with light amounts forecast for
the lowlands. Snow levels look to be higher with this system with
warmer temperatures in the forecast, through east wind may carry
below-freezing air to the tops of the passes and create a wintry
mix.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Showers linger into Tuesday
as the front quickly moves through the area in the morning. Focus
then shifts onto Christmas and the end of next week as additional
systems bring a setup closer to an atmospheric river keeping
precipitation and gusty winds in the forecast. QPF looks to be
more hydrologically significant, and snow levels around 3000 ft
over the Cascades may bring rounds of heavy snow to all the
Cascade passes starting Christmas day.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Post-frontal showers under S/SW flow this evening with
showers diminishing after midnight. Ceilings mainly VFR. Gusty S
winds to 20-25 kt through 06Z. Rain spreading inland again on
Sunday with possible MVFR conditions.

KSEA...Showers in the vicinity through this evening with SW winds
8-12 kt. Rain spreading in by 18z Sunday with possible MVFR
conditions. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The next is a series of strong frontal systems will
cross western WA on Sunday for another round of elevated wind and
seas. Gales are forecast over the Coastal Waters and the eastern
Strait of Juan de Fuca. In addition, seas will build to 19 to 23
ft over the outer Coastal Waters. Additional strong frontal
systems will impact the region through the week ahead. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A series of frontal systems will move through the
area this weekend into early next week and bring several rounds of
precipitation. Widespread river flooding is not likely with minor
rises on area rivers expected. The Skokomish river has fallen into
action stage this morning but is expected to return above flood
stage tomorrow. Increasing precipitation around Christmas and into
the end of next week could push the Skokomish back up to moderate
flood stage. For the remaining rivers, the threat of flooding
will also increase in the middle of next week as ensembles
continue to indicate the potential for significant precipitation
area-wide. While discrepancies remain, this most likely will lead
to an increased chance of river flooding becoming more widespread
and landslide concerns that may impact holiday travel.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
