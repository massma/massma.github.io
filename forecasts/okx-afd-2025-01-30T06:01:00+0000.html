Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
101 AM EST Thu Jan 30 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure briefly builds in tonight and moves offshore
Thursday. A frontal system impacts the area late Thursday night
and Friday, followed by high pressure Saturday into Sunday. The
high pressure gives way to a weaker frontal system Sunday night
into Monday. High pressure may return next Tuesday.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM THIS MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Increased winds for the rest of the ngt with some areas still
coming in at advy lvls at midnight.

Heights rise as ridging builds into the region tonight, and
winds and gusts will be diminishing very late. Temperatures
should fall into the teens inland and the lower 20s closer to
the coast.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM THIS MORNING THROUGH 6 PM FRIDAY/...
Surface high pressure moves across the region Thursday, as upper
ridging also crosses the area and moves offshore late Thursday
afternoon. With the high generally to the south the will be no
cold air damming or a blocking high to the north. Also, with
the approach of the next frontal system Thursday night, and
mainly toward Friday morning, a deep southerly flow will be
developing as warm air moves in aloft. Soundings are indicting a
rather shallow surface cold layer across the interior, and
especially the valleys. With the onset toward Friday morning,
rain is expected across most of the southwestern section, with
the possibility of light freezing rain inland. Light ice
accumulations are expected.

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
Unsettled weather will occur on Friday as low pressure and
its associated frontal system impacts the region. The modeling
has largely been consistent with the evolution of the system
over the last few days with slight adjustments to the track of
the low. The pattern continues to support a liquid event as
there is no arctic air source to advect cold and dry air
southward. The only concern for any frozen precip will be at the
onset of the event early Friday morning across the interior.
Surface temperatures will be slower to rise above freezing with
potential for a period of light freezing rain. The parent low
passing over or just N of the area support surface winds
increasing out of the SW, helping to warm temperatures above
freezing. It may take until mid morning for some of the valley
locations to fully rise above freezing, but overall the Friday
event will be a cold rain. Ice accretion of a few hundredths is
possible across the interior and a winter weather advisory may
be needed for Friday morning if current trends hold.

The cold rain will persist into the evening before tapering off
from west to east the first half of the night. Liquid
equivalent amounts total around three tenths inland to just
under an inch out east. High temperatures on Friday may be
reached late in the day once the low moves across the area,
generally in the lower to middle 40s. Colder air will return
behind the system Friday night, but middle level drying will
likely prevent any wrap around precip. Lows by early Saturday
range from the 20s to low 30s.

The model guidance continues to be in agreement on the overall
synoptic flow pattern this weekend into next week. The flow will
be zonal with mainly flat shortwaves potentially passing
through from time to time. Surface high pressure will move over
New England on Saturday before retreating east on Sunday. A weak
frontal system moves through Sunday night into Monday. Precip
chances appear low Sunday night into Monday with any notable
trend on the models shifting the parent north the last several
cycles. This may lead to chance of light rain at the coast and
some light snow inland Sunday as the associated warm front lifts
through the area. PoPs have been capped off at chance given the
weak system and continued uncertainty with timing, track, and
amplitude. Brief high pressure follows on Tuesday before
potential of another fast moving system mid week.

Temperatures will largely be near normal with the only exception
of Monday where temperatures should be above seasonable levels.

.AVIATION /06Z THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure builds in for Thursday. For Thursday night, high
pressure moves offshore and a warm front approaches from the
south and west associated with an approaching low pressure
system.

VFR conditions are expected through much of the TAF period. MVFR and
perhaps lower conditions will be possible towards 12Z Friday
with initial precipitation developing with an approaching warm
front.

NW winds near 20 to 25 kt with gusts near 30 to 35 kt will
gradually diminish to around 15 to 20 kt sustained with gusts 20
to 25 kt near daybreak and into early Thursday morning. Winds
become more westerly thereafter during the day with gusts mainly
to near 20 kt. Winds subside shortly before sunset.

     NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Amendments possible due to uncertainty in timing of wind gusts.
Amendments possible due to uncertainty in timing of initial
precipitation early Friday.

.OUTLOOK FOR 06Z FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY...

Late Thursday Night: Chance of MVFR or lower in rain, possibly
starting as freezing rain at KSWF.

Friday: Any freezing rain at KSWF in the morning changing to rain
with MVFR or lower, possibly ending as light snow at KSWF after
midnight. Otherwise, outside of KSWF, mainly rain expected. SW winds
G20kt NYC metro/coast.

Saturday: Becoming VFR in the morning. NW winds G20kt until around
midday.

Sunday: Chance MVFR or lower conditions mainly at night, with snow
changing to a wintry mix or rain.

Monday: VFR. SW winds G15-20kt.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The gale wrng has been extended on all waters thru tngt. Small
Craft seas likely remain on the ocean waters into Thursday
morning, so a SCA will be more likely for the ocean waters once
gales end. There may be a brief break in SCA conditions on the
ocean waters before gusts increase once again by late Thursday
night as another frontal system begins to impact the waters.

SCA conditions are likely Friday and Saturday on the ocean.
Elevated seas may persist on the ocean east of Moriches Inlet
Saturday night with conditions below SCA levels on Sunday.
Marginal SCA conditions are possible on Monday, mainly east of
Moriches Inlet.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
