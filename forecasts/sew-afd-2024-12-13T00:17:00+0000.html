.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light showers will continue across the area tonight
as a disturbance moves across northern California. A stronger
system will move into the region on Friday, bringing gusty winds,
lowland rain, mountain snow, and high surf to western Washington.
Coastal flooding will impact the shorelines of western Washington
throughout weekend. A wet and active weather pattern will persist
into early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light showers will continue
across the area this evening as a system continues to move across
northern California. With snow levels hovering between 3000-4000
feet, light snow accumulations will be possible in the mountains.
Mainly under 1 inch is expected for the Cascade passes.

A stronger system is expected to impact western Washington Friday
into the weekend. This system will bring gusty winds, widespread
lowland rain, mountain snow, and high surf to the area with
impacts expected through Sunday. Coastal flooding will impact the
shorelines of western Washington through the weekend as well.
Details on hazards expected with this system are highlighted
below:

LOWLAND RAIN: Rain is expected to start moving into the region
along the coast on Friday morning and become more widespread
throughout the day. Periods of rain will continue through Sunday
with the heaviest rainfall accumulations expected along the coast
and Olympic Peninsula. Isolated thunderstorms are also possible
along the Pacific Coast on Saturday - with the main hazards being
small hail, brief heavy downpours, erratic winds, and lightning.

MOUNTAIN SNOW: Snow levels on Friday will range between 3000 to
4500 ft and will fall to around 3500 ft by Saturday. Snow is
expected for areas above 3500 ft. Snow levels will then fall to
around 2000 ft by Sunday. Uncertainty remains in the snow forecast
with easterly winds persisting in the passes. Locally higher
amounts will be possible should snow levels remain lower as a
result.

WINDS: Winds will begin to increase on Friday afternoon, peak
overnight, and are expected to subside through the day Saturday.
The strongest winds are expected along the coast, the San Juan
Islands, Whidbey Island, Whatcom County, and Skagit County.
Maximum winds gusts of 30 to 40 mph are possible in these areas.

COASTAL FLOODING: Coastal flooding is expected along the Pacific
Coast on Friday. The flooding threat will persist for the outer
coast through the weekend and will gradually move inland through
the weekend. Flooding is expected during the late morning to mid-
day high tides. Significant coastal flooding will be possible
along the Pacific Coast on Saturday with an inundation of 2-3 ft
above ground level possible. Large waves building along the
Pacific coast could exacerbate impacts to coastal communities.

HIGH SURF: Large waves will build towards 17 to 19 feet at around
along the Pacific Coast on Saturday. Large waves may wash over
beaches, jetties, and other structures unexpectedly. Localized
beach erosion will be possible.

Showers will persist into Sunday, but look to gradually taper
through the day as a transient upper ridge moves over the area.
This reprieve will be short-lived, however, as yet another system
looks to move into the region Sunday night into Monday.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Conditions look to remain
active into early next week as another system moves into the
region on Monday. Expect additional periods of lowland rain and
mountain snow to persist through Tuesday. Ensemble guidance then
indicates an upper level ridge building across the Western US by
midweek. There remains some uncertainty in the amplitude and
placement of the ridge axis, however. If the ridge axis moves too
far inland, it could keep western Washington susceptible to
additional systems moving into the region. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak disturbance continues to lift north
bringing additional moisture into the region. This will continue to
support widespread showers and lower ceilings to the region. Expect
widespread MVFR conditions with reduced visibility in rain and
ceilings trending lower into the evening. These conditions will
persist overnight into early Friday. Breezy low level winds will
increase, especially closer to the western portions of the area and
perhaps extending eastward through Puget Sound terminals. Expect a
shift to easterly winds by mid-afternoon Friday as the next weather
system approaches.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings and visibilities possible this evening as
showers increase. Surface winds remain southerly overnight through
early Friday, but shift to become easterly by late afternoon. Low
level winds increase a bit through the day Friday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak frontal system associated with an occluded surface
low over the Oregon coastal waters will continue to slowly drift
inland. Winds will begin to increase Friday along the coastal waters
ahead of a strong low pressure system that move to the northwest of
the area Friday into Saturday. Gale force winds are very likely
across the coastal waters Friday evening into Saturday, with the
potential for some storm force gusts, particularly through the outer
coastal waters. Winds will initially be southeasterly then switching
to southwesterly on Saturday as the low moves towards Vancouver
Island. Winds will also increase over the interior waters, with
Small Craft Advisory winds likely Friday night into Saturday.

The Gale Watch has been upgraded to a Gale Warning for the coastal
waters, with the a Small Craft Advisory issued for the East Strait
of Juan de Fuca, where winds will begin to increase earlier on
Friday.

A surface ridge will briefly build over the waters on Sunday before
another frontal system will move through the area on Monday, which
will likely bring another period of breezy winds and large seas.

Seas 8 to 12 ft today will rapidly build Friday up to 16 to 20 ft
(with up to 23 ft possible through the outer coastal waters) through
Saturday. Seas should subside below 10 ft on Sunday but look to
increase again on Monday.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Next round of precipitation with a weak system
today will only result in small rises on the rivers. A stronger
storm will set up along the coast over the weekend with the
potential to bring more significant precipitation to the region.
Latest guidance has been uncertain regarding rainfall amounts in
the Olympics, with overall totals being lower than originally
forecasted. Area rivers will rise, with only the Skokomish River
being expected to reach above action stage. Right now, the
forecast did lower, with the river hovering just under minor flood
stage Saturday into early Sunday. This will continued to be
monitored as more guidance becomes available. Additional rounds
of precipitation could keep the Skokomish river at or near flood
stage into early next week. We will continue to monitor the
rainfall forecast and the river forecast for this weekend.
