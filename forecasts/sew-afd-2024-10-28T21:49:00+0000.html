Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
249 PM PDT Mon Oct 28 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Shower activity will continue to taper off into
Tuesday ahead of the next incoming system. A vigorous frontal
system will cross western Washington on Wednesday, producing
widespread rain and snow alongside locally windy conditions
through late Thursday. Unsettled conditions are favored to
continue through the rest of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Scattered showers will
continue to progress eastward throughout the day today as an upper
level trough axis swings across the region. Weak high pressure
will build inland tonight, allowing conditions across the lowlands
to mostly dry out with lingering snow showers over the Cascades
throughout the day Tuesday. With snow levels hovering near 3500-4000
ft, higher elevations of the Cascades will see an additional inch
or two of snow accumulation, including through some of the higher
mountain passes. Sun breaks in the clouds will allow for
temperatures to peak near normal today and tomorrow, in the mid
50s across the lowlands.

A vigorous cold front will push inland across western Washington
on Wednesday, bringing in another round of precipitation
alongside slightly cooler temperatures and locally windy
conditions. The bulk of the moisture will move over the Olympic
Peninsula Wednesday morning, paired with wind gusts along the
coast of 25 to 30 mph. Precipitation will fill in most of the
region by the afternoon, with the initial wave of moisture moving
east of the Cascade crest by Wednesday evening. Conditions will
destabilize behind the front, with shower and isolated
thunderstorm activity moving inland Wednesday afternoon and
evening and continuing overnight into Thursday. The parent low
pressure system will swing across the Pacific Northwest on
Thursday, maintaining shower activity mainly south of the Puget
Sound and over the mountains. Snow levels will stay near 3500 ft
as this storm system moves over the region, with potential for 6
to 12 inches of snowfall over higher elevations of the Cascades
and Olympics. Ensembles show a moderate (50%) chance of 6 inches
or more of snowfall through Stevens Pass by Thursday morning, and
conditions through the Cascade Passes continue to be monitored.
Rainfall totals for the lowlands through Thursday has remained
fairly consistent, with amounts up to three quarters of an inch.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Forecast models continue to
show large differences Friday and beyond, with some ensembles
drying out conditions by late Friday and some maintaining
unsettled conditions through the weekend. Ensemble mean solutions
maintain slight chances of precipitation through the weekend, with
fairly consistent temperatures in the low to mid 50s across the
lowlands.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper trough axis over Western Washington
will shift east of the Cascades this afternoon with the flow aloft
becoming north to northwesterly tonight. Scattered showers producing
occasional MVFR ceilings will diminish by this evening with the
exception of some weak convergence zone activity over central Puget
Sound. Locally gusty surface winds will ease this evening. A
combination of light wind and abundant low level moisture will
produce widespread low MVFR ceilings late tonight through Tuesday
morning. VFR conditions will return areawide Tuesday afternoon.

KSEA...A mix of MVFR and VFR ceilings expected into this evening as
weak convergence produces a few showers in the vicinity. Ceilings
will consolidate into low end MVFR by 09Z through Tuesday AM before
lifting again to VFR in the afternoon. Gusty surface winds will ease
by this evening and may become variable for a few hours before
returning to light southerly overnight.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak surface low over the interior waters will fill and
shift eastward on Tuesday as a weak surface ridge builds over the
coastal and interior waters. The ridge will shift eastward Tuesday
evening as a vigorous frontal system moves into the offshore waters.
A frontal triple point will come onshore over Vancouver Island while
the trailing cold front sweeps onshore into Western Washington late
Wednesday morning. There is a 70-90% probability of gale force wind
gusts just ahead of the front over portions of the coastal waters
and the east entrance to the strait. Gale watches are in effect for
those areas. A gradually weakening surface low will track
southeastward across the offshore waters Wednesday night into
Thursday. Weak surface ridging will rebuild over the waters early in
the coming weekend.

Coastal seas will build back into hazardous double digits Tuesday
night into Wednesday and likely remain above the 10 foot threshold
into early Friday.
