Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
313 PM PDT Fri Aug 30 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper-ridging will remain in place into the weekend
resulting in warm and dry conditions through Sunday. A weak
weather system will bring cooler temperatures and a slight chance
of showers into the forecast early next week. The cool down will
be brief, with temperatures expected to warm by mid-week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Clear and relatively calm
conditions continue to dominate across western Washington this
afternoon as we head into a warm and dry Labor Day weekend.
Temperatures will continue to warm Saturday, reaching the upper
70s and 80s across most of the lowlands and nudging up another 1-5
degrees on Sunday. HeatRisk levels will reach the moderate/orange
category across much of the region. Overnight temperature recovery
should be enough to provide some relief during this short warm
spell, and heat products are not expected to be needed at this
time. As always, we will continue to monitor and adjust as needed.

By Monday, a transient low will begin to eject NE from near the
CA/OR border northeast. This will usher in some cooler
temperature as well as a very slight chance of mountain showers,
mainly in the south Cascades.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...By Tuesday, the low will be
moving through the intermountain west and ridging will once again
begin to build over the Pacific Northwest. This will result in
warm and dry conditions returning during the middle portion of
next week. However, the duration of warm and dry conditions is
highly uncertain. Cluster analysis shows significant differences
in the potential patterns by late next week, ranging continued
ridging and warm and dry weather to incoming troughing with a
decent moisture tap which would result in a transition to cool
and wet weather. That transition will likely occur at some point
in the next 6-14 days, but exactly when is hard to tell at this
time.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge with west southwesterly flow aloft
through Saturday. Offshore flow increasing again late tonight and
Saturday morning. Clear skies through Saturday with VFR.

KSEA...Clear skies. Northerly winds 6 to 10 knots around this
afternoon. Winds switching back to northeasterly after 04z.
Similar pattern is expected on Saturday. Felton/Wolcott<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure offshore will continue to build offshore
and start to interact with a thermally induced low pressure system
along the coast. Northerly winds will persist over the coastal
waters and may be breezy at times but overall will stay under any
thresholds.

Light offshore flow will transition to onshore flow on Sunday as a
weak frontal system approaches the area. Latest guidance suggests
possible small craft advisory westerlies through the Strait of
Juan De Fuca Sunday night and Monday night, but confidence is too
low at this time.

Coastal seas around 4 to 6 feet generally throughout the weekend
and into the beginning of next week.

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will promote warm and dry conditions
through the weekend. This, combined with light offshore flow in
the low levels will allow for relative humidity values to drop
into the 15-20 percent on Saturday and Sunday in the southern
portions of the Cascades and mountain valleys. Relative humidity
recovery overnight will be around 40- 60%. Conditions will also
become unstable over the region Saturday and Sunday afternoon,
which would meet critical fire weather criteria.

Area fuels, however, currently remain moist from recent rains,
mitigating the impact of the critical fire weather conditions.
Fuels will continue to dry out quickly, however, and it`s possible
that ERCs will exceed the 90 percentile and bring the possibility
of Red Flag conditions over the weekend. So it will be important
to monitor how fast fuels respond. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
