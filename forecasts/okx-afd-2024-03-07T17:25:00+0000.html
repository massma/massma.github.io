Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
1225 PM EST Thu Mar 7 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
Low pressure slowly pulls away today with high pressure north of the
area nosing in momentarily on Friday. Low pressure impacts the
region over the weekend. High pressure builds in behind the low next
week.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM FRIDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Minor updates made mainly to temperatures this afternoon. Rest
of the forecast is mainly on track.

For this afternoon, low level moisture will still be in place
with a trough of surface low pressure still running across the
forecast area. Some lift will be provided as a trough aloft and
the left entrance region of an upper level jet streak pass
through. This will bring a chance of light rain or drizzle for
most of the area, with the better chances generally over the
eastern half of the forecast area. Breezy this afternoon with a
northerly wind. High temperatures ranging from 45-50 over the
easternmost zones and 50-55 in most other spots. Some upper 50s
even possible in a few locations.

Any lingering light rain/drizzle should end during the evening
for the eastern end of Long Island. It will remain breezy with
a north wind gusting at times to around 25 mph. Clearing
overnight with north winds continuing to bring in a drier air
mass. Minimum temperatures should get into the 30s, with
northern portions of the Hudson Valley getting to freezing.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM FRIDAY MORNING THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT/...
A transitory high ridges down from the north into the region from
Labrador. This will keep the CWA dry. Skies should average out
mostly sunny, with perhaps some clouds offshore getting into far
eastern and southeastern sections. Temperatures will continue to run
a few degrees above normal, with mainly lower and middle 50s. Far
eastern sections may only get into the middle and upper 40s with
winds light out of the northeast. Clouds should then increase Friday
night well in advance of the next system that arrives for the
weekend later Saturday. Look for an onshore flow to develop late at
night with lows in the 30s, to around 40 in the NYC metro.

&&

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
No significant changes in the long term and stuck fairly close to
NBM/previous forecast.

Subtropical pacific tap of moisture seen on water vapor gets here on
Sat. This will produce cloudy skies ahead of the next chances for
rain. As a deepening nrn stream trof interacts with this surge of
moisture, rain develops late Sat, ending Sun mrng. The pcpn is
mainly on the front end of this sys with a significant dry slot.

As the cold pool aloft moves in Sun ngt, pcpn chances transition to
shwrs. H85 gets to -8C so shsn possible. Drier weather returns for
Monday.

A ridge then builds across Tue and Wed keeping the area dry and
allowing for a warming trend.

The NBM was followed for temps Sat-Wed with a few local
adjustments.

.AVIATION /18Z THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure has moved east of the terminals and moves
northeast of the region this afternoon.

All TAF sites are at MVFR cigs and should remain that way until
turning VFR this evening. Timing cigs in the TAF may be off by
an hour or two, which may result in an amendment. VFR conditions
are expected to hold tonight and tomorrow.

North winds 10-15kt with gusts 20-25kt expected through the
afternoon and evening. Winds diminish tonight with wind speed
falling to 10kt or less and winds becoming a bit more
Northeasterly. Winds become light and shift south-southeasterly
tomorrow afternoon.

  NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Amendments likely for changing ceilings through this afternoon.

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...

Friday: VFR.

Saturday: VFR into the afternoon, then becoming MVFR or lower with
rain developing late.

Saturday Night: IFR and rain. SE gusts 20-25 kt possible.

Sunday: MVFR or lower with rain in the morning with possible
improvements to VFR in the afternoon. S winds become W into the
afternoon. Gusts 20-25 kt, especially in the afternoon.

Monday: Mainly VFR. NW G25-30 kt.

Tuesday: VFR. NW G20-25kt

.MARINE...
Small craft conditions will be in place for all waters today and
into this evening, with small crafts likely lowered for the western
non-ocean waters late tonight. Small craft gusts are likely to
linger for the eastern non-ocean waters into early Friday morning.
Seas will remain elevated through Friday with small craft conditions
continuing on the ocean waters.

Conditions improve Friday night into early Saturday, then winds and
seas increase late Sat thru Sun with low pres tracking thru the
region. There is a chance for a period of gales with the system. It
remains windy on Monday with at least sca winds and Gales possible.
Winds gradually diminish on Tuesday.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
The next low pressure system to move across the area this weekend is
forecast to bring an average of 0.75 to 1.25 inches of rain. Locally
higher amounts will be possible. WPC has placed the area in a
marginal risk for excessive rainfall. Expect the potential for
another round of minor urban and nuisance type flooding.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
As the weekend approaches water level departures begin to increase
as minor coastal flood benchmarks get approached. Towards the late
Saturday and early Sunday high tide cycles more widespread minor
coastal flooding is starting to appear likely, with some locations
in Western Long Island potentially reaching moderate coastal flood
benchmarks. Uncertainty still remains with respect to the winds and
the precise timing of the next storm system for the weekend as these
factors will impact the total water level forecast.
