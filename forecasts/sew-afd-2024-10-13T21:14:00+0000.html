Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
214 PM PDT Sun Oct 13 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge with high pressure will leave one
more nice day across western Washington today. An active weather
pattern takes over from Monday through next weekend with multiple
systems bringing in periods of precipitation across the region.
Temperatures will also drop several degrees, becoming more
seasonal for this time in October.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>One more nice day to
wrap up the weekend today. An upper level ridge over Alberta
and eastern Washington begins to depart the area today to the
east. One more dry and warm day is on tap this Sunday across
western Washington (mostly clear skies with pockets of high cirrus
in the air). Temperatures have broken 70 in several places already
this afternoon (primarily in Puget Sound and west slopes of the
Cascades), but with cooler and wet weather on the way, this may be
the last 70 degree day for the foreseeable future.

The first of a series of weather makers is already visible on
satellite just off the Pacific Coastline. A visible cloud
band/moist conveyor belt stretches from the central Pacific
(around Hawaii) up into a low just off the Alaska/British Columbia
coastline. IVT analysis shows limited moisture funneling ahead of
a low/trough for Monday into Tuesday. This will aid a cold front
expected to pass through the region Monday into Tuesday for rain
showers. This first "atmospheric river" is expected to be the
weakest one this week, with limited QPF totals ranging from a
tenth to a quarter in the lowlands, and up to around half an inch
to an inch in the north Cascades, west Olympics and the coast. The
rain will pass through Monday morning from west to east, and
taper back going into Monday night to light showers. In addition,
sneaker waves will be possible with this system, so beach goers
should be on the lookout for high waves along the coastline.

A second, more vigorous trough digs off the Pacific Wednesday, and
swings around a stronger cold front into the Pacific Northwest
Wednesday. A 140 kt jet max pushes this front/trough inland with
much cooler air behind. High temperatures will drop from the
low 60s into the upper 50s Wednesday, with snow levels expected to
drop to around 4,000 feet by late Wednesday. The jet will help
funnel in moisture for additional rounds of precipitation
throughout the day Wednesday. Given the stronger temperature
gradient with this front, and cool air aloft, thunder will be
possible on Wednesday. This will likely create localized heavier
rainfall rates with any convection that is able to form. Flooding
is not expected to be a concern with this next system, but
rivers/streams will likely see rises with this system.
Additionally, many of the mountain areas above 4,000 feet will
likely see accumulating snowfall, with potential of some of the
snow sticking at Stevens Pass.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...The Wednesday system will
continue into Thursday with more rounds of precipitation
continuing through Thursday night. Amounts are quite a bit spread
from the mean, so it is too early to advertise potential amounts
with this Wednesday/Thursday system (but will most likely be in
the magnitude of an inch to a few inches, with the heavier amounts
in the Cascades and the coast/Olympics).

The pattern becomes a little bit more uncertain next weekend. Most
of the ensembles are showing another trough moving through
Saturday and Sunday (alternative would be ridging in the Southwest
underneath the trough). IVT analysis shows a more classic
moisture plume moving in from the central Pacific into the Pacific
Northwest. This will likely shift some between now and next
weekend, but the potential exists for a more "classic" atmospheric
river event next weekend with even more precipitation. The CPC
does have a slight risk of heavy precipitation next weekend. This
will be monitored throughout the week for potential hydro impacts.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Increasing southwesterly flow into Monday with upper
troughing over the NE Pacific and an approaching frontal system
tonight into Monday morning. High clouds are filtering into the
region this afternoon ahead of the next system, but VFR cigs will
prevail. Rain is expected to arrive along the coast by 12Z,
spreading to inland terminals around 17Z to 18Z. Largely MVFR
ceilings are forecast, though there could be pockets of IFR and LIFR
in locations more susceptible to lower cigs, such as OLM, PWT and
coastal terminals. Winds will be southeasterly for much of the
period, picking up slightly and turning more southerly late tonight
into early Monday morning as the front approaches.

KSEA...VFR cigs with high clouds overhead will prevail throughout
the rest of the afternoon. Light surface flow generally out of the
south to southwest will continue, but will experience a slight
increase in speeds as the front approaches on Monday morning. The
50th percentile ceiling forecast brings ceilings over SEA to around
1500 ft come 12Z Monday morning, with further reductions possible as
the rain sets in closer to 18Z. Rain will be light, but consistent
through the late morning into afternoon hours tomorrow, marking the
beginning of a wetter and more unsettled pattern through the rest of
the week.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light southerly winds expected for the interior waters
today, with continued south to southeast winds for the Coastal
Waters. Southerly winds will then increase tonight into Monday for
all area waters as a front moves across Western Washington. Small
Craft Advisory has been issued for the Coastal Waters with the south
winds into Monday morning. Conditions were borderline headline
worthy in the west entrance of the Strait of Juan de Fuca for winds
and possibly seas, but the part of the zone that will be most
impacted by heightened seas close to 10 feet and stronger winds will
be the western most extent, namely just off shore of Neah Bay. South
winds will also increase for portions of the interior waters,
especially for Admiralty Inlet Monday morning, hence, the rationale
for posting a Small Craft Advisory to cover the timing of the
frontal passage. Otherwise, winds will become lighter Monday night
through Tuesday. Another, potentially stronger front, is expected to
move through the area Tuesday night into Wednesday. Additional
headlines possible for increasing south to southwest winds during
this period. A post-frontal westerly push is forecast on Wednesday
for the Strait of Juan de Fuca as well.

Seas 5 to 7 feet will build to 10 to 13 feet later tonight into
Monday. For this reason, Small Craft Advisories continue for the
Coastal Waters due to seas Monday into Monday night. Seas are
expected to then briefly subside below 10 feet later Tuesday before
increasing to near 10 feet Wednesday and potentially into Thursday
as the more active and unsettled weather pattern continues.
