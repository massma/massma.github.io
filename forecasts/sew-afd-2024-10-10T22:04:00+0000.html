.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Conditions will follow a warming and drying trend
through the weekend as an upper level ridge builds into the
Pacific Northwest. Troughing will move into the region on Monday
and beyond, bringing in chances for rain and cooler temperatures.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Despite cloudy skies across
much of the lowlands this morning, conditions will continue to
improve this afternoon as high pressure aloft builds into the
region. While temperatures today will peak near or slightly below
normal in the 50s to low 60s, a warming and drying trend will
continue into the weekend with highs reaching 70 degrees across
much of the lowlands by Saturday. High clouds will persist tonight
and linger through Friday before weak offshore flow allows skies
to clear by Saturday.

By Sunday, the upper ridge axis will begin to shift eastward as a
longwave trough deepens along the Pacific Northwest coast. While
this will introduce more cloud cover across western Washington,
the best chance for rain showers will be along the coast, where
rainfall totals will be light. Sunday will be the last day of
above-normal temperatures through the period before a more fall-
like pattern settles into the region.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Models continue to show
good agreement over cooler and wetter conditions for much of next
week as a deep upper level low moves over the region. High
temperatures will dip into the 50s for most areas by Wednesday,
with long range ensembles even favoring below normal temperatures
through the end of next week. Precipitation will spread inland on
Monday, continuing through Thursday as troughing continues to dig
southward. Preliminary rainfall totals range from an inch across
the lowlands to up to 3 inches over the Olympics and Cascades.
Snow levels will drop to near 4000 ft by mid-week following the
cooling trend, with elevations above 4500 ft on track to see
several inches of snow accumulation.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak high pressure overhead will keep the flow very weak
overhead. As a result, low clouds have lingered through the morning
and afternoon hours for a majority of terminals along the I-5
corridor. Satellite shows the clouds beginning to scatter out, and
will continue to erode through 20-22Z this afternoon. VFR conditions
will become region-wide this afternoon with high clouds remaining.
Winds out of the south remain breezy at 8 to 10 kt (occasional gusts
to 15 kt). Tonight: the winds will become light and variable, and
there are increasing chances for widespread fog/IFR or LIFR stratus
for a majority of terminals tomorrow morning (between 12-18Z). This
would primarily affect the Cascades/Olympics, all of the Southwest
Interior, Kitsap Peninsula, and up from Shoreline to Mt. Vernon.
This will clear out to VFR skies by late Friday morning/afternoon.
Winds will remain light out of the north Friday (below 5 kt most
places).

KSEA...Low MVFR clouds lingered through the morning and early
afternoon. Satellite shows the cloud coverage beginning to erode -
should scatter enough to be VFR by around 21Z. Winds continue out of
the north at 6 to 10 kt. NBM gives a 25% chance of IFR Friday
morning (20% for LIFR). Potential the low clouds/fog stay out of the
terminal, but will put a mention of it in the TAFs (siding with the
weaker flow aloft and low moisture) - will improve to VFR by Friday
afternoon. Winds will become light and variable Friday out of the
north.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak high pressure continues to shift inland this
afternoon, with winds out of the north over most waterways. A couple
gusts to 15 kt have been observed over the Puget Sound waters,
otherwise winds have generally remained out of the north/northeast
over the waters at 6 to 10 kt today.

The next frontal system will weaken well offshore on Friday. This
will likely keep the pattern partially offshore through this
weekend, with waves at 3 to 6 feet. A stronger cold front will move
through Monday, with rain and potential for gusty southerly winds in
the outer coastal waters Sunday and Monday. Seas will build back up
to 10 to 13 feet Sunday into Monday with this disturbance, dropping
back to 6 to 9 feet middle of next week.
