Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
851 AM PST Wed Nov 27 2024

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Scattered showers continue this morning, particularly
across portions of King and Snohomish Counties, as well as
adjacent to Admiralty Inlet and along the coast. Showers will
slowly dissipate later this afternoon into this evening for most
of these areas. Otherwise, mostly cloudy conditions, with some
clearing along the Olympic Peninsula today. No major updates this
morning.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...Some light showers will linger at times, especially
in the Cascades and along the coast. A weak disturbance Friday
brings slightly higher shower chances along with opening the door
to cooler air into the region. A drier pattern emerges late in the
weekend through early next week as high pressure builds solidly
over the region.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Fairly widespread (but light)
showers continue to stream across the region as a cooler
west/northwest flow pattern becomes established over the region.
Otherwise, relatively light winds and abundant low level moisture
is supporting low stratus and some areas of fog. Expect these low
clouds to continue through around mid-morning. Expect flow to
take on an increasingly northerly component later today and into
the Thanksgiving holiday, which should bring some drier air moving
into the region and limiting the shower coverage even further.
With the building high pressure, expect some overnight/morning
clouds and cool overnight temperatures. A weak impulse moving
south along coastal B.C. could provide a focus for some additional
showers and some cooler air later on Friday, but again, no
significant impacts are expected.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Ensemble guidance
continues to suggest that the dominant feature will remain a
relatively high amplitude across the far eastern Pacific and
extending into the Pacific Northwest. Again, there is a non-
trivial subset of ensemble members that suggest a few passing
disturbances in the flow could round the ridge and at least bring
a few showers to portions of the area. As mentioned in the short
term section, the associated precipitation amounts are relatively
light so while there is some mention of showers through the
weekend, it`s likely that there won`t be a significant round of
precipitation and only perhaps a few light showers at times into
the weekend. Meanwhile, with a shift to a cooler and somewhat
drier flow aloft, expect to see the air mass to cool a bit late in
the week and this weekend. This could bring overnight
temperatures down into the 30s (lower 30s in the coolest spots,
mid 30s for most of the Puget Sound Region) for a few mornings
during this time period. For the start of next week, still strong
agreement in the ensemble guidance suggesting a ridge remaining in
place, though increasing disagreement in just how strong it is
and where the ridge axis remains. The next organized frontal
system may begin to approach the coastline by around midweek to
bring a return of more widespread precipitation chances. 12<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow aloft as an upper level ridge builds
across the northeast Pacific and into western Washington. At the
surface, light variable to southeasterly surface flow and some
scattered slow-moving showers are leading to a mixed bag of ceilings
across the area. MVFR to IFR conditions are present across the Puget
Sound interior, with patchy fog present across portions of the
Southwest Interior. CIG/VIS trends have been bouncing up and down
quite a bit, and will likely continue to do so through this morning,
with widespread improvement not expected until after 19-21Z. A
return to low-end VFR then is expected this afternoon and this
evening, until fog redevelops across the area early tomorrow
morning. The best chances look again to be across the Southwest
Interior and Kitsap Peninsula, through more fog could develop later
tomorrow morning approaching the Seattle area and the fog-prone
valleys (including PAE).

Winds remain very light (5 kt or less), somewhat variable as the
direction veers throughout the day.

KSEA...MFR to IFR conditions this morning with slow moving showers
north of the terminal. Visibility is beginning to improve with the
showers away from the terminal, but expecting ceilings to remain at
least MVFR through most of the morning, with VFR conditions not
expected until around 21Z. Conditions remain VFR through this
evening. Ceilings may lower early tomorrow morning, with a chance of
fog (20-30%) after around 09-12Z. Winds remain light today (5 kt or
less), currently southwesterly and expected to gently veer
throughout the day to northerly by this evening then back to
easterly overnight.

&&

.MARINE...High pressure will continue to build over the coastal
waters today into tomorrow and remain in place through at least this
weekend. Some surface fog and lower stratus is possible this
morning, limiting visibilities over Puget Sound, particularly in
areas north of western Snohomish county through the San Juan
Islands. Winds remain light northwesterly across the coastal waters
through the week, becoming southerly this weekend. Seas 2 to 4 ft
through the week, increasing to 6 to 8 ft this weekend as long
period swell arrives to the area from a system over Alaska.
