Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
257 AM PDT Sun Mar 16 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Lowland rain and mountain snow will continue through
Monday as multiple systems move across the Pacific Northwest.
Upper level ridging on Tuesday may provide a brief break in
precipitation. Another series of systems will move through the
region on Wednesday throughout the end of the week, bringing
additional rounds of lowland rain, mountain snow, and breezy winds
at times to western Washington.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Broad upper level troughing
over western Washington this morning will continue to bring
scattered rain showers across the area. With the jet centered
south of our region, can expect shower activity to lighten up into
the later afternoon hours. Snowfall in the mountains will
continue, with the Winter Storm Warning still in effect until this
afternoon. Snow levels generally around 2000 to 2500 feet will
continue to support snowfall through the mountains the rest of the
day, although will be lighter this evening as QPF values have
lessened. The aforementioned broad upper troughing will once again
provide some instability across western Washington, with a chance
of an isolated thunderstorm or two developing through this
afternoon. The most likely areas to see a lightning strike or two
will be mainly coastal areas and possibly the southern interior.

Widespread shower activity will continue into Monday, but will be
overall less in coverage. Snow levels on Monday look to drop to
around 1500 feet. Onshore flow will increase across the area as
well, with latest guidance suggesting a convergence zone to
develop across northern Puget Sound sometime in the afternoon.
Snow will continue in the mountains, but, with any strong banding
that develops, snow levels locally could drop further which would
allow higher snowfall accumulations over the Cascade Zones for a
period during this time.

Upper level ridging looks to develop on Tuesday for a brief break
in the weather before more active weather returns.

Daytime highs look to remain in the upper 40s to lower 50s with
overnight lows in the mid 30s.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...A series of systems will
traverse across western Washington starting on Wednesday, keeping
the weather pattern active, with widespread rain, more mountain
snow, and breezy winds. Another system will enter on Thursday and
Friday (with these systems looking a bit wetter at this time),
with additional systems through the weekend for more wet and
unsettled conditions.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft will become westerly today as an
upper trough axis over the coastal waters shifts onshore. The air
mass remains moist and somewhat unstable. Widespread MVFR ceilings
and pockets of IFR in showers will improve to VFR after 21Z with
shower activity decreasing as the trough axis progresses eastward.

.KSEA...MVFR showers with some tempo IFR through 18Z. Overall
shower activity expected decrease after 21Z with ceilings gradually
lifting to VFR. Surface winds light S/SW rising to southwesterly 7
to 11 knots this afternoon.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak troughing will persist over the waters into
early Monday then surface ridging over the offshore waters will
expand into area waters Monday afternoon and evening. This will lead
to an increase in onshore flow. The surface ridge will shift inland
on Tuesday and a frontal system will approach the coastal waters
Tuesday night. The front will move onshore on Wednesday with another
to follow late in the week.

Double digit seas over the coastal waters will ease below 10 feet
Monday and Tuesday before building again mid to late week as a
series of systems affect the waters.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>While conditions will remain showery through the
weekend, expect the bulk of the moisture associated with the
incoming system tonight into Sunday to remain well to the south of
the area. Precipitation over the southern Olympics will result in
slight rises on the Skokomish River, with current projections
bringing the river into action stage (cresting roughly a foot
below flood stage) early this morning. At this time, flooding is
not expected across most of the area`s rivers over the next 7
days. The exception remains the Skokomish - which could enter
flood stage late next week as additional wet systems move across
the area.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
