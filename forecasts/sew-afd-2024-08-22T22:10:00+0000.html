Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
310 PM PDT Thu Aug 22 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper-low will churn across the region through
Saturday bringing active weather. Ridging replaces it on Sunday
before weakening Monday. Troughing north of the area returns on
Tuesday with a building ridge expected midweek onward as the
pattern yo-yos.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A stout upper-low will
continue to churn off the WA/OR coast this evening as showers and
cloud coverage spin into the area. This activity is forecast to
continue overnight with the HREF Grand Ensemble indicating most of
the precipitation falling over the Olympic peninsula and SW
interior. Lows are to bottom into the 50s with the warmest
temperatures over the Seattle metro. Guidance has the
aforementioned low tracking inland Friday-Saturday as rain showers
and well-below normal temperatures persist. To quantify how
anomalous this low center is for this time of the year, high
temperatures will top out 10-15 degrees F below average for mid-
late August with highs in the lower to upper 60s for both Friday
and Saturday.

Rainfall is slated to decrease in coverage the second half of
Saturday into Sunday as the low center lifts off into BC. With
that, the current 48-hr rainfall forecast (5 AM Friday - 5 AM
Sunday) stands at 0.50-2.00" throughout the WA interior lowlands
(highest totals north of I-90) with coastal areas 0.25-0.75". The
mountains could see up to 1.00-3.00". Conditions are forecast to
dry out on Sunday as upper-ridging builds into the region. We`ll
also see a bump up in temperatures as highs return into the 70s
across the interior but still below average. 60s are to continue
for coastal areas with overnight lows in the 50s throughout the
short term.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...The ridge is slated to
weaken on Monday as a weak shortwave moves by to the north on
Tuesday. Here, a chance of showers will return to the forecast.
Highs cooling back into the mid 60s to lower 70s. Models are
hinting at a stronger upper level ridge building beginning
Wednesday returning the area to more August like weather with some
80s possible by the end of the week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low off the coast continues to spin and
move south this afternoon. As it does, considerable mid and upper
level cloud cover remains intact across western Washington. There
are some favorable dynamics associated with this low pressure system
that could facilitate some thunderstorms after 06Z. High resolution
model data suggests that these storms would be coming up from the
south and reaching Puget Sound by 06Z, lasting through 08Z-09Z, with
more shower activity off to the west on the Olympic Peninsula. Any
thunderstorms that do develop will be capable of strong wind,
lightning and heavy rain. Winds will otherwise be out of the WSW
throughout the period, impacting primarily southern and Cascade
approach corridors. Tomorrow, expect MVFR cigs in the morning and
more WSW flow.

KSEA...Winds NW this afternoon around 5kt. VFR cigs with upper level
clouds remaining. Thunderstorm potential after 06Z will be something
to monitor as some of the high res models have suggested that there
could be some convective cells moving in the vicinity of the
terminal between 06-09Z. After that, some off and on shower activity
through the night and MVFR cigs on Friday morning with WSW flow 5-8
kts.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Rain showers and chances for isolated thunderstorms will
be possible after 06Z tonight and could bring lightning, gusty
winds, and lower visibilities in heavy rain to portions of the area
waters at times. Westerly winds will increase along the Strait of
Juan de Fuca this evening, but have kept it below Small Craft
criteria at 10-20 kt, with only occasional gusts to 25 kt expected.
The westerly push down the Strait tomorrow evening looks like it has
more potential to reach SCA criteria as additional systems move into
the area.

Small craft advisory strength westerlies will be possible along
the central and eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca Friday night into
Saturday. High pressure will then rebuild into the coastal waters
by early next week and looks to bring generally benign conditions.

Seas will primarily persist at 3-6 feet across the coastal waters
through the weekend and into early next week.
