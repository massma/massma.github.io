.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...There is weak upper level
troughing over the Pac NW today as the jet dives south into
southern CA. Across western WA, we`re seeing a few
lingering/isolated showers on radar with this trend continuing
through the day. There`s been some clearing overnight which has
allowed temps to drop into the 30s (mainly around the south
sound). Temperatures this afternoon will reach the lower 50s or
close to normal.

Dry, north, flow sets up on Thursday as a ridge nudges into the
West. The drier air mass will knock temps further down with lows
near freezing around the south sound. We may see patchy morning
low clouds and/or fog, otherwise clear skies by the afternoon.

The ridge shifts inland on Friday for another dry and stable
weather day. Morning lows again will be cool and in the 30s.
Expect highs around 50. 33

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...High pressure dominates
the West this weekend, keeping precipitation to our north and into
southern B.C. The air mass will be warmer with highs in the 50s to
lower 60s both Saturday and Sunday. Wetter weather returns Sunday
night and Monday as a weak frontal system slowly shifts inland.
Snow levels hover around 3500 ft with a few inches of snow on the
higher mountain peaks and passes. Moist, onshore flow follows on
Tuesday for additional lowland rain and mountain snow. 33

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft today as an upper-low slides into
the region. Flow aloft becomes more variable overnight into early
Thursday. Ceilings have improved this morning with many places in
VFR. Localized IFR/LIFR has also been observed due to fog in the
along the southwest interior, Kitsap Peninsula, and coast. Lower
cigs are to linger before widespread scattering to VFR is reached by
18-20z. Southerly winds will switch from the north between 21-22z
around 4 to 8 kt. Northerly flow aloft will usher in drier air, but
low-level residual moisture may bring more localized low clouds and
patchy fog into Thursday morning.

KSEA...VFR this morning as much of the clouds have scattered at the
terminal. Expecting VFR to persist well into the late evening. S
surface winds (4-8 kt) will lighten and transition to N/NW around 21-
22z between 5-10 kt. Low clouds/patchy fog possible early Thursday
morning.

.MARINE...Light onshore flow as we`ve long since been post-frontal
across area waters. A SCA remains over the outer coastal waters for
high seas through Thursday evening. A bit of reprieve on Friday
before a frontal system enters Friday night into Saturday with
another round of small craft winds into the weekend. An active
pattern is favored into next week. Seas 8 to 10 ft through Thursday
evening. 6 to 8 ft on Friday before building towards 10 to 12 ft
over the weekend.
