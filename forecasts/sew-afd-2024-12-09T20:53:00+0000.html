Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
1253 PM PST Mon Dec 9 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A ridge of high pressure will move across the region
through early Wednesday allowing for mostly dry but cool
conditions. Overnight fog, dense in areas, is expected tonight
along with areas of frost and perhaps black ice. Additional wet
weather systems will begin to move through the area Wednesday and
beyond with the strongest system likely on Saturday. That system
could bring gusty winds and increase the risk of coastal flooding,
particularly along the Pacific coast.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Partly to mostly clear
skies this afternoon as lower clouds scatter out and a transient
ridge of high pressure shifts east across the region. The
combination of these semi-clear skies, ample antecedent moisture,
and cool temperatures will lead to a chilly night with the
potential for widespread fog development. Areas of dense fog are
certainly possible and a Dense Fog Advisory may be needed by this
evening. Additionally, overnight lows tonight are likely to fall
to around or a few degrees below freezing, resulting in the
potential for frost and even black ice where moisture remains on
surfaces. Conditions will gradually improve Tuesday afternoon.

A couple of weak systems will slide near or through the area
Wednesday and Thursday allowing temperatures to moderate and
brining more widespread precipitation to the region once again.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Friday may be relatively
quiet between systems, but an amplifying trough of low pressure
will be moving across the eastern Pacific towards the area. There
is still a wide range of potential outcomes with this system but
the potential exists for strong gusty winds to develop Saturday.
Looking at the NBM probabilities, there is a 40-50% chance of peak
gusts in excess of 45 mph along the coast and through the north
interior Saturday. For 60 mph, those probabilities fall to 10-20%
across the north interior and 10-30% along the Pacific coast. The
outcome will be sensitive to the surface low associated with this
system and where it tracks. Also sensitive to this will be the
amplitude of any coastal flooding. Astronomical tides will peak
again this weekend into early next week along the outer coast
(early to mid next week along the inner coast). The potential
combination of a sub-1000mb surface low, the tides, and increased
surf activity will need to be monitored closely. At this point the
threat appears highest on Saturday along the outer coast given
the possible confluence of factors.

Confidence in forecast details really begins to fall off this
weekend but the door will remain open to additional weather
systems that look to continue into the week-2 time frame based on
the most recent outlooks from the Climate Prediction Center.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A building upper level ridge axis offshore will shift
onshore on Tuesday with north to northwest flow aloft becoming
westerly. Light surface gradients combined with plentiful low level
moisture will create widespread LIFR conditions Tuesday morning with
areas of surface visibilities below a mile and ceilings 200 feet or
less. Conditions are expected to improve to VFR most areas by mid-
afternoon Tuesday.

KSEA...VFR conditions this afternoon are expected to deteriorate
after sunset with LIFR ceilings and visibilities developing 08Z-10Z
and persisting through Tuesday morning. Surface winds light north
to northeasterly. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure over the waters through Tuesday will
weaken Wednesday. A splitting front will reach the area late
Wednesday into Thursday. High pressure will briefly rebuild Friday
before a significantly stronger system arrives over the weekend with
headlines expected for all waters. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...Conditions will dry out throughout the first half of
this week under high pressure. A weak system is on track to bring a
quick shot of precipitation on Thursday and Friday, with rainfall
amounts of an inch or less. A stronger storm system will set up
along the coast over the weekend with potential to bring in more
significant precipitation. While area rivers will rise with this
weekend system, the Skokomish River is currently the only river
forecast to enter Action Stage, potentially nearing minor flood
thresholds. However, liquid amounts remain uncertain and conditions
will continue to be monitored.
