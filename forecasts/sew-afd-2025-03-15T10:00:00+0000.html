Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
300 AM PDT Sat Mar 15 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Additional systems today through Monday will keep
lowland rain, steady mountain snowfall, and occasionally breezy
conditions in the forecast throughout the weekend. Drier, benign
weather is expected early next week before active weather returns
midweek.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system is currently
on track to push through western Washington early this morning. As
this system crosses the area, it will continue to bring lowland
rain, mountain snow, and some breezy winds through most of the
day. Per recent radar imagery, rain has already started to spread
northwestward through the interior early this morning. More
steadier rain will be prominent throughout the morning/afternoon
hours, before transitioning to scattered showers into the evening.
Following this, a Winter Storm Warning continues for the Cascades
until Sunday morning. The more heavier accumulations are to be
expected early this morning into Sunday, with lighter snowfall
amounts to continue through Monday. Snow levels generally around
2000 to 2500 through the weekend.

In addition, with upper level troughing passing by overhead, there
is some support for a chance thunderstorm or two this afternoon
and evening, especially over the coast and southern Puget Sound.
HREF probabilities for isolated lightning ranges from 40-60%,
mainly focused along the coastal areas, and some localized areas
in the Cascades.

Widespread showers will continue into Sunday as the broad upper
level trough passes by western Washington. This may support
another chance of an isolated thunderstorm or two across most of
the interior. The highest chances of lightning seem to be focused
on the coast once again.

High temperatures across most of the interior will remain in the
upper 40s to lower 50s throughout the weekend, with lows in the
upper 30s dipping into the mid 30s to kick off the week. Snow
levels Monday look to lower around 1500 feet, with snowfall
continuing through the mountains and scattered showers in the
lowlands.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Somewhat drier conditions
are possible Tuesday through Wednesday as a weak ridge builds
over the area. Ensemble members then show support for wetter and
cooler conditions to return later in the week, with active weather
back on tap.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A broad upper level trough remains over the region with
west to southwest flow aloft. The airmass is moist and somewhat
unstable. Widespread MVFR ceilings in showers expected today with
pockets of IFR this morning. Ceilings may briefly improve to VFR for
a period this afternoon before deteriorating again tonight as
another upper level disturbance produces another round of MVFR in
showers. Increasing low level onshore flow in the wake of a surface
trough moving onshore will lead to gusty southwesterly surface winds
from mid-morning into this afternoon before easing this evening.

.KSEA...MVFR in showers expected from around 12Z through midday.
Some lifting to VFR expected 21Z through around 03Z before ceilings
drop back to MVFR again tonight with increasing showers. Gusty S/SW
surface winds to 20-25 knots at times expected from around 14Z
through 21Z before winds gradually ease late this afternoon and
evening.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface low near Cape Disappointment will weaken as
it slowly moves inland this morning. Increasing onshore flow in its
wake will lead to small craft advisory conditions across the coastal
waters, west/central portions of the strait, and Puget Sound/Hood
Canal. A secondary weak surface low will move onshore over the north
Oregon coast late tonight, but will produce minimal wind impacts to
area waters. Weak troughing will remain over area waters into Monday
before a surface ridge builds across the waters into Tuesday.
Another front will approach the coastal waters around the middle of
the coming week.

Combined seas will build back into double digits this weekend over
the coastal waters before subsiding below 10 feet early next week.
The return of more active weather by the middle of the coming week
will likely produce more headlines for wind and/or hazardous seas.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Forecast precipitation through the weekend has
continued to come down somewhat with the significant amounts
expected well to the south of the area. There remains a small
chance of the plume of deeper moisture shifting northward, and
have left the ESF over Mason County in effect. Regardless,
precipitation over the southern Olympics this weekend will result
in rises on the Skokomish River. Current projections bring the
Skokomish River into action stage early Sunday. While other rivers
will experience rising water levels, river flooding is not
expected elsewhere over the next 7 days.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
