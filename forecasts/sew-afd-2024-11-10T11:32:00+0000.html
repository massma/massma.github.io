Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
332 AM PST Sun Nov 10 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system will move through the region tonight
into Monday for lowland rain, mountain snow and the potential
of river flooding. Active weather will continue through the
remainder of the week, with more lowland rain, mountain snow,
potential river flooding, chances of thunder, high surf and breezy
conditions. Cooler conditions at the end of next week with more
troughing.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An deep upper level low with
an associated front remains offshore early this morning, but will
gradually move closer to western Washington this afternoon. Dry
weather this morning will be brief as this system moves inland
this afternoon, spreading rounds of moderate to heavy
precipitation at times, especially along the coast, Olympics, and
the Cascades. The heaviest times of precipitation will be later
tonight into Monday morning, where we could see 2-3" in the
Cascades and the coast, 3-4" in the Olympics, and around 1-1.5"
for lowlands, in terms of precipitation. Heavy rainfall during
this time will bring the Skokomish River in Mason County into
flood stage, where a Flood Watch continues to remain in effect.
Snow levels will initially be 5000-6500 feet tonight before
falling to 3500-4500 feet later Monday. Snow accumulations can be
expected at SR 20 and Washington Pass, therefore, the Winter
Weather Advisory for the North Cascades still remains in effect.
A foot of snow is also possible at Mount Baker. Locally breezy
conditions likely Monday morning, with the breeziest winds along
the coast and north interior (around 25 to 35 mph). In addition,
seas look to build Monday night anywhere from 18 to 23, which
could lead to high surf along the coast. The air mass also
continues to be unstable, with chances of thunderstorms along the
coast through Tuesday.

As we head into Tuesday, rain will be lighter than Monday and we
will see rivers briefly lower but it will be brief as a more
wetter system arrives Tuesday night into Wednesday morning.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...A wetter, more active
system will move through the area on Wednesday that will lead to
more focused rain over the Olympics and the Cascades with
additional concerns for river flooding into Thursday. Additional
rivers are forecasted to pass Action Stage, and be perhaps close
to Minor flood stage. Refer to the Hydrology section below for
more details concerning river flooding. A stronger shot of snow is
likely for the Cascades as well, especially in the Northern and
Central Cascades. Snow levels look to be around 4000 to 4500
during this time. Additionally, coastal flooding may be a concern
with higher astronomical tides and combined seas running a bit
high.

Cooler conditions will continue into the weekend as upper level
troughing settles over the Pacific Northwest. High temperatures
seem to be a touch cooler, in the mid to upper 40s. Snow levels
take a dip into the 2500-3000, where mountain snow returns along
with lowland rain.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft continues across the region
early Sunday as the next disturbance approaches the region. With a
stable air mass, abundant residual low-level moisture, and light
winds, will continue to see IFR to low MVFR ceilings and visibility
across Western Washington this morning. Expect increasing southerly
low-level winds later this morning ahead of the approaching front,
and this should provide enough mixing to bring ceilings lifting to
VFR across the region late morning or early afternoon. However, this
will be short-lived as ceilings again lower to MVFR tonight as the
next front moves through and brings steady rain. Breezy surface
winds this evening, especially near the coast and the eastern Strait
of Juan de Fuca/Admiralty Inlet.

KSEA...MVFR conditions continue early this morning with brief
lowering to IFR possible (around 30% chance) toward daybreak.
Increasing southeast winds, to 8-10 kt, late morning should bring
ceiling lifting to around 5000 feet toward midday. Expect arrival of
rain and lowering ceilings again after 03z tonight with MVFR
cigs/visibility returning overnight Sunday night.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Winds have eased across the waters in between frontal
systems this morning. Seas will continue to hover in the general 8
to 12 ft range through the next day or two, with a brief lull this
morning expected. Otherwise, another round of stronger southerly
winds will develop over the waters this afternoon and evening, with
gusty southeasterly SCA strength winds expected across most zones
(except for Puget Sound/Hood Canal). The likelihood of frequent or
widespread gale gusts has decreased over the last 24 hours, which
has lead to the gale watch being converted to a small craft advisory
for most zones. The chances for more frequent gale gusts remains a
little higher over the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca, but even here
is only around a 40% chance.

Expect seas to sharply build over the coastal waters late Monday
into Tuesday, as another large northwest swell from the Gulf of
Alaska makes its way into the region. This will likely build seas
into the 18-22 ft range early Tuesday. Furthermore, a stronger
frontal system arrives later Tuesday with two impacts: first,
chances for widespread gales remain considerably higher with this
system than the earlier ones (60-80% chance across Eastern Strait of
Juan de Fuca and coastal zones, and even a 40% chance for Puget
Sound), and second, seas will again build above 15 ft, this time
with a mix of southerly short period contribution and longer period
west swell. Marine conditions remain very active through the week
ahead as yet another disturbances is expected to reach the waters
later in the week.     Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A more significant chance of precipitation is
expected today through Monday, and again on Wednesday as an
active weather pattern returns with weak to potentially moderately
strong atmospheric river events coming through the area. The
precipitation amounts will be strongly orographically influenced
with precipitation totals in the mountains expected to be 3 to 5
inches for both storms except locally over 6 inches on the
Olympics for the last one (Wednesday).

The succession of storms will increasingly build up soil moisture
and river levels throughout this period which will increase the
possibility for river flooding. Snow levels vary generally from
4000 to 6000 feet which will impact precipitation type and affect
the amount of storm runoff.

At this time, the Skokomish River is the only river forecasted to
rise into flood stage, and potentially into moderate flood stage
during the middle of next week. For other rivers, significant
rises are expected with several river forecast points above Action
Stage, and flooding could be possible, especially in the Northern
and Central Cascades. Flooding extent will continue to depend on
rainfall rates, temperatures, as well as snow levels with
precipitation that falls with each of these weather systems next
week. We will continue to assess the hydrologic conditions and
forecasts for any additional areas of potential flooding.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
