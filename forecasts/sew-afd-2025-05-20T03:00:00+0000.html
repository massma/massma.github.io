Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
800 PM PDT Mon May 19 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Scattered showers in the wake of an exiting front will
persist this evening into tonight due to an upper level low off the
Canadian coast. Another round of showers with possible isolated
thunderstorms expected Tuesday before shower chances decrease
through the week and temperatures warm.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Latest radar
continues to show scattered showers over W WA this evening with echo
intensity trending downward...although the risk for brief periods of
moderate rainfall is still present at least through sunset. Thunder
threat pretty much nil as any lightning activity has been well to
the east of the CWA. Current satellite as well as a look out the
window shows plenty of breaks in the clouds overhead, still allowing
for some peeks of blue sky as the sun descends.

Inherited forecast remains on track and no need for any evening
updates at this time. For additional forecast details, please refer
to the Previous Discussion section below.

From Previous Discussion...The upper level trough/low that sent the
frontal system across Washington today has stalled along the BC
coast. This low will eject another wave across the area this evening
into early Tuesday bringing another uptick in shower activity. A
third, weaker wave will then slide through the area as the low
weakens late Tuesday into early Wednesday. This parade of waves will
keep showers and low-end chances of weak thunderstorms in the
forecast through late Tuesday.

By Wednesday an unrelated compact wave will move across the
west coast generally across northern CA and OR, perhaps glancing
the southern Cascades.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
Weak split flow aloft will keep the area fairly seasonable
Thursday into Friday. Chances for weak afternoon showers, mainly
over the mountains, cannot be ruled out. Temperatures should
warm 2-4 degrees in most areas, but still generally in the 60s
across most of the region.

By the weekend, the longwave pattern amplifies with ridging over
the western US and troughing across the eastern Pacific. This
should allow temperatures to warm a few more degrees Saturday.
For Sunday and particularly Monday, there is a massive range of
potential outcomes in how and when this pattern breaks down.
For example, in terms of temperature there is a 10th-90th
percentile range of 60-81 degrees for KSEA. This also has
ramification for precipitation chances.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Troughing will be across Western Washington into Tuesday
for continued westerly flow aloft. Onshore flow continues at the
surface.

Generally VFR cigs with scattered showers. Localized MVFR cigs
possible under showers and along the coast. Cigs will likely lower
towards MVFR Tuesday morning, with MVFR or low-end VFR expected for
most Tuesday AM. Localized LIFR/IFR is possible around PWT. VFR cigs
again Tuesday afternoon with showers at times. Breezy SW surface
winds this afternoon, particularly at PAE, BFI, PWT, and SEA. Winds
will remain locally breezy through this evening before slowly
tapering a bit further later tonight. S/SW winds Tuesday.

KSEA...VFR cigs into tonight. Cigs will lower towards MVFR Tuesday
morning (generally after 12-13z), with approximately a 30%
probability of MVFR cigs through 19z Tuesday. VFR Tuesday afternoon.
A few showers may be around at times through Tuesday. Breezy SW
surface winds through this evening, with gusts of 20 to 25 kts.
Winds will subside a bit tonight. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow continues across Western Washington. Small
Craft Advisory winds will continue this evening due to gusts ranging
20 to 25 kts around Puget Sound. SCA west winds also expected into
this evening for the outer Coastal Waters. Winds will then slowly
subside tonight across the waters. A weak westerly push is expected
through the Strait of Juan de Fuca Tuesday evening, but at this
time, winds are expected to remain below SCA threshold. Weak high
pressure will then build over the area Wednesday into Thursday. A
weakening system may approach the area on Friday before high
pressure builds again further over the weekend.

Seas will build to 9 to 13 feet for the Coastal Waters tonight
through Tuesday. Seas will then subside below 10 feet Tuesday night
and subside to 4 to 6 feet by midweek. JD
