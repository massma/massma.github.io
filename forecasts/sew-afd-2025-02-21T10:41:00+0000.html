Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
241 AM PST Fri Feb 21 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Rain increases through the day Friday as the next
frontal system approaches and ushers in a deep plume of moisture
and a warmer air mass. An atmospheric river will be focused on the
Pacific Northwest this weekend, maintaining heavy precipitation.
An active pattern continues through early next week with
additional rain and winds Monday and Tuesday, before drier and
mild conditions likely toward midweek.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Latest NWS radar imagery
depicts the leading precipitation spreading into the interior of
western Washington this morning, reaching near Puget Sound at this
hour. A bit of a relatively lull is possible around midday, but
precipitation will more significant increase late today and into
tonight with warm front cross the region. In the warm sector,
expect snow levels to rise from around 3500 feet to near 5500
feet by Saturday morning. Some initial light snow is likely for
the Cascade passes before things switch over to rain.

The deep plume of moisture in an atmospheric river then sets up
over the region into Saturday. This will bring heavy rain, high
snow levels, and gusty winds at times. Temperatures will be rather
mild in the strong southerly flow. A series of embedded impulses
will serve as the focus for the heaviest rainfall. Not much change
in the QPF from previous thinking with general ranges of 4 to 7
inches over the Olympics and 4 to 5 inches over the Cascades from
Saturday through Sunday night. With the addition of high snow
levels and existing snow, additional water will further add to the
runoff into rivers. The HYDROLOGY section has more details about
potential for flooding.

In addition, gusty southerly winds will develop at times over the
weekend. An initial round of gusty winds is expected on Saturday,
peaking during the afternoon and evening. NBM probabilities
highlight the coast and areas north of Everett for the greatest
chance of gusts exceeding 45 mph (generally 50-80%). This may
lead to localized power outages and tree damage. Breezy winds will
still be expected elsewhere across the region, but with a lower
likelihood of impacts. Another round of breezy winds are then
expected on Sunday, especially for the same favored locations as
Saturday.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Expect the initial
moisture tap to shut off by early Monday, but there isn`t much of
a break before another stronger disturbance will approach the
region. Ensemble guidance continues to suggest a deepening low
will approach the region on a track toward Vancouver Island. The
associated front will bring bring renewed heavy rain to portions
of the area on Monday and Tuesday. Additionally, another round of
stronger winds will be possible, with a large spread in guidance
at this time owing to uncertainty with respect to the position of
the low. Behind the front on Tuesday, expect abundant post-frontal
showers (and perhaps evening a flash or two of lightning) and
lowering snow levels that could bring accumulating snow back to
the Cascade passes.

Ensemble guidance then favors high pressure building over the
region Wednesday and Thursday. This would bring increasingly dry
conditions along with very mild temperatures with afternoon highs
reaching the upper 50s to around 60.       Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft this morning will back to
southwesterly and increase today ahead of an upper trough and
associated frontal system. Ceilings will lower to MVFR in increasing
rain along the coast by early afternoon with said conditions
spreading into the interior late this afternoon or early evening.

KSEA...Ceilings at or above 5000 feet will lower to MVFR thresholds
in increasing rain near or after 00Z. Surface winds southeasterly 7
to 10 knots.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A warm front lifting northward across the offshore
waters will move onshore as a weakening occlusion early Saturday
morning. This will keep headlines in place for the coastal waters as
well as northern portions of the interior waters. A stronger system
will follow later on Saturday with a triple point passing just west
of Cape Flattery late in the day. This is expected to generate a
relatively brief period of gale force winds over the coastal waters
Saturday afternoon. A frontal boundary will stall across the waters
on Sunday as the parent low well offshore lifts northward toward
Haida Gwaii. A potent sub-980 millibar surface low is expected to
pass over the offshore waters later in the day on Monday for the
potential for gales and/or brief storm force winds for the coastal
waters and seas in excess of 20 feet. Uncertainty remains with
regard to the specific track of the low at this time.

Coastal seas will build back to 12 to 15 feet tonight and remain in
hazardous double digits until at least the middle of next week. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A series of storms starting Friday will bring a
potential for river flooding, urban flooding, and landslides this
weekend into early next week. An atmospheric river event is forecast
to bring heavy precipitation and much higher snow levels to the
Pacific Northwest this weekend through the early part of next week.
There remains a high likelihood (greater than 70% chance) of 3 to 4
inches of rain across the mountains, and around a 40% to 50% chance
of seeing a 5+ inch total in the favored locations of the Olympics
and the central Cascades.

This heavy rainfall, coupled with snow levels around 6000 ft or
higher during the bulk of the precipitation, will bring rises on
many area rivers and could bring a handful near or above flood
stage, especially in the Olympics, the central and southern
Cascades, and southwestern Washington. Additionally, the
Skokomish River is expected to flood as early as Saturday. A Flood
Watch remains in effect for Mason County for the Skokomish River
and a Flood Potential Outlook has been issued for much of the
remainder of western Washington for the possibility of river
flooding. Urban and small stream nuisance flooding is possible
during the heaviest rainfall on Saturday and Sunday. This amount
of rain will also increase the threat of landslides throughout the
episode.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
