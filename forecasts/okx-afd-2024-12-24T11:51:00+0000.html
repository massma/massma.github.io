Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
651 AM EST Tue Dec 24 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
A clipper system passes north of the region today. High pressure
returns tonight and will remain in control through Saturday. A
frontal system slowly approaches Saturday night through Sunday.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
Forecast on track this morning. The only exception was to update
temperatures a bit especially across Long Island, where most
reporting sites are now at or below freezing, except at KMTP
which is in the upper 30s.

Otherwise, a clipper system passes north of the area this
morning. As the clipper system passes to the north, it will
drag a surface cold front/upper trough across the region. A
quick band of accumulating snow is expected with these features.
Not much change with the timing. Expect the band of snow
reaching the interior portions of the Lower Hudson Valley and
Northeast New Jersey between 5am-7am, NYC metro and Hudson
River Corridor, 7am-10am, and the rest of CT and Long Island
8am- 12pm. The band will move across any given location quickly
with snow lasting only a few hours. The band of snow will also
weaken as it moves east towards the NYC metro, Long Island and
Southern Connecticut. Some of the east end may mix with some
rain as well mid to late morning.

Snowfall accumulations should range around 1.5 inches across the far
northwestern portions of the CWA to around a half inch across NYC
and CT. Lesser amounts are expected across long Island where some
rain may possibly mix in with the snow this morning.

Will continue to run with an SPS for much of the area for the
potential for slick roadways.

Conditions will quickly improve from west to east mid to late
Tuesday morning. Dry conditions are expected across the area
Tuesday afternoon with partly to mostly cloudy skies.
Temperatures should be able to rise into the middle and upper
30s in the afternoon.

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/...
The shortwave and clipper system continue moving off the New England
coast tonight. Ridging builds aloft behind it allowing surface high
pressure to return across New England Tuesday through Thursday
night. Expect dry, but cold conditions with temperatures Wednesday
and Thursday in the 30s and lows at night falling into the teens and
20s.

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
Upper ridging along the east coast Friday moves into the Western
Atlantic during Friday into Saturday, and remains into Sunday. A
trough over the midsection of the nation sends a shortwave through
the area Sunday night into Monday. At the surface high pressure over
the region Friday shifts into the Atlantic through the weekend. A
frontal wave approach Saturday night and moves through the area into
the beginning of next week. Timing of the system has come into
better agreement however, placement is still somewhat uncertain.
Especially by Sunday the placement of the wave, and potentially a
warm front becomes more uncertain.
And uncertainty with temperatures increases. Have generally used
the NBM probabilities, but capped at the high end of chance.
Precipitation will be mainly rain, with a chance of some light snow
at the onset Saturday night.

Temperatures will be near seasonal normals Friday, and then rise
above normal Saturday into the beginning of next week. Used the
deterministic temperatures Saturday into Monday.

&&

.AVIATION /12Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak frontal system passes through the terminals this morning.

MVFR with a period of light snow, a chance of a brief period of
IFR especially NW for the NYC terminals. Once the snow ends

2 inches, NYC metros and KBDR 15Z-16Z with up to an inch, KISP
13Z-17Z with around 1/2 inch, and KGON 14Z-18Z with less than
1/2 inch.

Winds W 5-10 kt becoming NW around 10 kt around midday, and N
less than 10 kt this evening and tonight.

Amendments for changing flight categories, and timing of light
snow ending.
