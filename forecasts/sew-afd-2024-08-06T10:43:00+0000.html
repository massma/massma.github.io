Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
343 AM PDT Tue Aug 6 2024

.SYNOPSIS...An upper trough will move through today for increasing
onshore flow. Temperatures will rebound Wednesday through late
week with warming temperatures aloft. Thunderstorm potential
increases over the Cascades later this week. Troughing may develop
early next week for slightly cooler temperatures.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Stratus is spreading into
Puget Sound early this morning with increasing onshore flow.
Troughing will slide across Western Washington today, leading to
the increase in clouds this morning, with clearing for the
interior this afternoon. Highs today will be cooler, and
generally range in the 70s for the interior and 60s along the
coast.

Ridging will begin to build into Western Washington Wednesday for
warming temperatures and less stratus in the interior during the
morning. Temperatures will continue to increase on Thursday, with
rather warm 850mb temps. In addition to the hotter temperatures
beginning Thursday, 850/925mb winds will transition more easterly,
with northerly winds at the surface, perhaps leading to an
increase in haze from wildfires over the Cascades as well as into
BC. Temperatures on Thursday are forecast to be in the 80s to low
90s for much of the area, corresponding to widespread Moderate
HeatRisk levels, with isolated major HeatRisk towards the Cascade
Foothills. Along with the heat concerns, thunderstorm potential
increases over the Cascades on Thursday, particularly for the
North Cascades, due to increasing instability, with probabilities
at this time ranging 15-25% for this area.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Very warm temperatures will
likely continue on Friday, with continued concerns of haze due to
easterly flow aloft. HeatRisk levels will likely remain Moderate
for most, with some slight cooling likely along the coast. In
addition, thunderstorm probabilities increase further for the
Cascades on Friday, with NBM probs 20-35% during the afternoon and
evening. Onshore flow looks to increase Saturday into Sunday,
leading to some cooling in temperatures. Uncertainty increases in
ensembles early next week, however, troughing may begin to
influence the interior PacNW a bit more for further slight
cooling in temperatures. JD

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft continues across Western
Washington. Another push of marine stratus is underway with IFR to
low MVFR ceilings across most terminals by 12z and lingering through
much of the morning. With a slightly deeper marine layer, expect
scattering to occur a few hours later through the interior (closer
to midday) and again perhaps not at all along the coastline. Another
push tonight will reinforce the marine stratus, but it doesn`t
appear as strong as this morning`s push.

KSEA...Expect marine stratus with ceilings around 1000 ft (perhaps
dipping closer to 800 ft by 12z) through the morning push. The IFR
or low MVFR ceilings likely lift and scatter out around 19z. Light
southerly winds this morning will gradually become west or northwest
by the afternoon.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...A persistent pattern will continue across the region
through early next week with broad high pressure offshore and lower
pressure inland. Diurnally driven westerly winds through the Strait
of Juan de Fuca will continue, with Small Craft Advisory winds
expected this evening at least in the central strait and nearest to
the international boundary. Onshore flow will weaken later Wednesday
into late week. Persistent northwest winds will continue over the
outer coastal waters, maintaining steep seas generally around 5 to 6
feet.

&&

.SEW WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
WA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory from 1 PM this afternoon to 1 AM PDT
     Wednesday for Central U.S. Waters Strait Of Juan De Fuca.
