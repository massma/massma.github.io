Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
851 AM PDT Fri Nov 1 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Unsettled weather continues through the weekend, with
the bulk of the precipitation expected today as a weather system
moves across Western Washington. Another stronger frontal system
is expected on Monday with lowland rain, breezy winds, and
mountain snow. Drier weather possible midweek.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No major updates have been
made this morning. Rain is persisting throughout much of western
Washington this morning, with some lingering snow in the Cascade
Passes. Will be evaluating the duration of the snow this afternoon
to see if it warrants an extension of existing winter weather
headlines. Otherwise, the rest of the previous discussion can be
found below with an update to the aviation and marine sections.

Widespread, steadier showers continue across Western Washington
this morning with an upper low lingering offshore. Precipitation
will likely peak in intensity through midday for most of lowlands,
but showers will continue through early Saturday as the trough
slowly progresses eastward. The primary impact through early
Saturday will be continued mountain snowfall. Forecast QPF amounts
have generally risen over the last 12 hours, thus increasing
snowfall amounts, particularly in the North Cascades. Latest snow
total forecasts generally range 10 to 15 inches as a storm total
for Mt. Baker Ski Area, with amounts of 8 to 12 inches for Rainy
Pass. For this reason, the Winter Weather Advisory was upgraded to
a Winter Storm Warning into tonight for this area. Winter Weather
Advisories also continue for the central and southern Cascades,
with additional snowfall amounts heaviest around Mt. Rainier.

Showers may briefly taper off later tonight into Saturday morning
for Puget Sound and Olympic Peninsula, with continued light
precipitation for the Cascades. Another weakening front will bring
an uptick in precipitation potential Saturday night into early
Sunday morning. In general, unsettled weather continues over the
weekend, particularly for the Cascades. Temperatures will remain
slightly below normal through the weekend, with highs in the upper
40s to mid 50s.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...A rather potent storm
system will move into British Columbia on Monday, bringing lowland
rain, gusty winds, and heavier mountain snow to Western
Washington. Ensembles have trended higher with QPF for this system
Monday into Monday night, thus increasing the mountain snowfall
totals for this period. Snow levels look to range 3500 to 4500
feet, with accumulating snowfall for Stevens Pass. In addition,
ECMWF EFI (Extreme Forecast Index), which helps identify periods
of anomalous weather conditions, is highlighting winds on Monday
for areas of Western Washington. This is evident further looking
into individual EPS members. NBM probabilities (from Everett
northward, along the water) range 50 to 90 percent for the 24 Hour
Max Wind Gusts exceeding 45 MPH from 06z Monday through 06z
Tuesday. All in all, this helps increase confidence in breezy
conditions with this system on Monday, in addition to the mountain
snowfall. For those drier weather fans, ensembles highlight
ridging building into the Pacific Northwest beginning Wednesday
into Thursday. There remains a lower chance for rain during this
period, mainly along the BC border, but majority of ensemble
members remain drier overall. Temperatures begin cooler Monday and
Tuesday before warming Wednesday and Thursday into the mid to
upper 50s. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West-southwesterly flow aloft as an upper-low churns
just west of the Vancouver Island coast. Mostly VFR currently
observed but MVFR cigs will become more widespread as the morning
progress. Slight improvement possible to VFR during the afternoon
but, continued rainfall won`t make it easy with localized visibility
reduction at play. A mixed bag of VFR/MVFR conditions are likely to
continue overnight into Saturday as rain breaks into showers.

KSEA...VFR ceilings at this time and remaining through the
morning. A bounce back from VFR/MVFR is likely throughout midday
with continued rainfall trying to keep visibilities down. HREF
Grand Ensemble has 60-70% probabilities of vis less than 6sm
during this time. East southeast surface wind between 8 to 12 kt
becoming more 5 to 10 kt for the second half of the day. Winds
transition more SSW overnight into early Saturday along with a mix
of VFR/MVFR conditions.

.MARINE...A 1000mb surface will continue to fill and track into WA
today. Headlines remain with SCA continuing for the coastal waters
and Grays Harbor Bar for high seas. Buoy observations continue to
show waves around 10 to 11 ft. A SCA for winds also remain for the
East Strait this morning. These products will be allowed to expire
today as marine weather is forecast to become more benign than seen
recently. These conditions will trend into Saturday but seas will
increase above 10 ft once again by early Sunday morning and building
upwards of 15 to 20 ft on Monday as a potent surface low passes to
the north, slamming into Haida Gwaii. Here we`ll see the return of
strong winds across area waters before conditions peter out into
Tuesday as surface ridging takes hold and remain through midweek.
