Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
745 PM PDT Wed Sep 11 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An exiting low pressure system will allow for scattered
showers this evening and early tonight before activity tapers off.
The remainder of the week looks dry before another system brings
widespread rainfall to the area Saturday. Dry conditions resume for
the start of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Current radar trends show
shower activity trending downward...although some sells can still be
seen over portions of the Olympic Peninsula and over the southern
half of the Cascades. Satellite shows lightning has not been a
factor with this activity for at least the past hour to hour and a
half...so would appear the thunderstorm threat has died.

Inherited forecast appears to be a little too generous with
instability but over all not really worth the effort to get in there
and noodle with it. Otherwise, the lingering chance PoPs over the
Cascades looks fine as the combination of orographics and some
lingering instability on the backside of the low will allow threat
of scattered showers to persist there into Thursday.

All that said, no plans for any evening update. For additional
forecast details, please refer to the Previous Discussion section
below.

From Previous Discussion...A strong upper level low continues to
progress inland over the Pacific Northwest this afternoon, with
particularly strong meridional flow offshore. Down at the surface,
an occluded front has slowed moving inland from the Pacific Ocean.
This front, along with a trailing surface trough, continue to
provide enough lift to support showers all morning long.

This afternoon, the lull in activity has allowed for limited
destabilization to take place. HREF ensemble guidance shows
300-400 J/kg of CAPE in southwest Washington (this drops to 100
J/kg in the Cascades). Lapse rates are steady around 6 degrees
C/km. Additionally, temperatures remain cool aloft with 500 mb
temperatures hovering around -16 degrees C. Ingredients will come
together for a few isolated thunderstorms to mix in with showers
this afternoon. The best chance of seeing a thunderstorm this
afternoon will exist around the Olympic Mountains, Chehalis
Valley, and Olympia. There`s a lesser chance in the Cascade
Foothills of thunderstorms. The thunder threat will diminish after
sunset. The storm mode will be pulse-mode, shortlived with a few
lightning strikes and possible graupel/heavy downpours.

Going into Thursday/Friday, the upper level low from Wednesday will
move inland. A transient ridge will break down over Canada rapidly
on Thursday, with strong northwest flow aloft settling in.
Conditions will therefore be dry, but with mostly cloudy skies
prevailing.

Saturday will see a return of active weather across western
Washington. The next upper level low will an accompanying surface
low with a notable cold front. Once this low arrives in B.C.
Canada, widespread stratiform precipitation will spread across the
coverage area during the day. Ensembles show a strong likelihood
of wetting rain, particularly across the north Cascades. There is
medium confidence in isolated thunderstorms with this system
Saturday (depending on how cold aloft it will end up being). Will
continue to monitor the risk for possible hydro impacts over the
weekend.

High temperatures remain constant through the short-term, with
daytime highs in the mid and upper 60s, and lows in the mid 50s.
Winds will be light at or below 5 to 10 mph.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...From Previous
Discussion...The system from Saturday will continue to produce
showers through Sunday across western Washington. Amounts for Sunday
are expected to be light at this time. Dry weather will settle in
again Monday and Tuesday, with northwest flow swapping to zonal.
Skies will remain mostly cloudy during this dry break. Ensembles are
picking up on a strong upper level system passing through next
Wednesday. This will be monitored for possible widespread
precipitation chances.
Temperatures will continue to remain steady, with highs in the mid
and upper 60s, and lows in the 50s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough will shift inland tonight and
allow for shortwave ridging to build into the region Thursday.
This will allow for southwesterly flow aloft to transition to more
northerly by tonight. Radar showing showers diminishing across the
CWA. Cigs a mix of VFR to MVFR with isolated IFR along the coast.
However, light surface flow combined with ample low level moisture
will bring the redevelopment of MVFR to IFR ceilings to the area
terminals overnight into Thursday morning. Ceilings will lift
towards VFR again by the afternoon hours.

KSEA...VFR conditions in place with remaining showers steering clear
of the terminal. Expect MVFR to IFR ceilings to redevelop overnight
with ample low level moisture and light flow in the low levels. W/NW
winds 4-8 kt will transition back to S/SW tonight and become light.
S/SW winds will increase to 4-8 kt again by the afternoon. 14/18<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...A weak surface low will continue to push inland tonight,
allowing for surface ridging over the northeastern Pacific to
build back into the coastal waters on Thursday. Another weak
trough looks to slide southward from British Columbia late Friday
into Saturday. Ridging will then build back into the coastal
waters early next week. Onshore flow will persist over the next
several days. Westerly winds along the Strait of Juan de Fuca may
increase towards 10-20 kt Thursday night into Friday and may
approach Small Craft criteria at times.

Seas are currently hovering between 3-5 ft over the coastal
waters, but will build towards 5-8 ft over the outer coastal
waters tonight. Seas will then gradually subside again towards 3-5
ft again by the weekend. 14

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>From Previous Discussion...A weak low pressure
system will spread additional showers across much of the region
evening. Some modest instability and cooler air aloft will bring the
potential (15-20%) of an isolated thunderstorm, with the highest
chances shifting into the Cascades. Expect any thunderstorms that
develop to be short-lived and of the pulse variety, putting out only
a strike or two before falling apart. Additionally, additional
rainfall with these storms (60%+ chance of wetting rain in these
areas) and abundant antecedent rainfall should preclude
significantly elevated fire weather concern.  Otherwise, fire
weather concerns remain minimal with near to below normal
temperatures and additional round of rainfall through the week
ahead. Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
