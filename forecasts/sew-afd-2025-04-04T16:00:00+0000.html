Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
900 AM PDT Fri Apr 4 2025

.SYNOPSIS...High pressure will build into the region through the
remainder of the week, allowing conditions to dry out and warm up.
Wet and cooler conditions are on track to return towards the end
of the weekend and continue through mid-week as troughing settles
into the Pacific Northwest.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Morning temperatures have
warmed above freezing and the Frost Advisory will expire as
planned. 33

Previous discussion...With dry northerly flow aloft, temperatures
will continue to dip early this morning into the 30s across the
lowlands. Patchy fog alongside areas of frost are favored to
develop south of the Puget Sound, including Olympia southward
across the Chehalis River Valley. A Frost Advisory remains in
effect for these areas through the mid morning. High pressure will
continue to amplify inland throughout the day today, allowing for
mostly sunny skies by the afternoon and temperatures peaking in
the mid 60s across the lowlands.

High pressure will continue to amplify and shift inland through
Saturday, maintaining mild conditions across western Washington.
However, incoming cloud cover from an approaching storm system
will limit temperatures to the upper 60s to low 70s for most
areas Saturday.

The next chance for widespread precipitation increases late
Saturday night as a front moves inland across the Pacific
Northwest. Precipitation will reach the coast by early Sunday
morning, filling in eastward throughout the day. Southwest flow
aloft will maintain mild temperatures in the 60s across the
lowlands with snow levels between 6000-7000 feet on Sunday.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...A cold front will push
inland late Sunday into Monday, maintaining widespread showers as
temperatures cool back into the 50s and snow levels lower to
2500-3000 feet. Moist westerly flow is favored to continue
through the first half of next week, with periods of breezy winds,
persistent rainfall over the lowlands, and periods of
accumulating mountain snow.

Ensembles show ridging rebounding over the western US towards the
end of next week, but a large amount of uncertainty remains over
the northwestern extent of the ridge. However, offshore troughing
maintains a slight chance of precipitation throughout the extended
forecast period.

will increase tonight into early Saturday morning ahead of an
incoming system. Winds this morning are light, calm to E/SE up to 5

afternoon before returning to E tonight and beginning to increase
after 12Z Saturday to around 5 to 10 kt.

.MARINE...Broad high pressure over the northeast Pacific will remain
in place through Sunday, continuing the period of light winds and
seas. The next frontal system will move through the waters on
Sunday, bringing a quick round of breezy winds which may require
headlines. Additional systems look to traverse the area waters early
next week, keeping breezy conditions in the forecast.

Combined seas 3 to 5 feet through the rest of the week and into the
weekend. Seas will start to gradually build upwards Saturday night
into Sunday, reaching 10 to 13 feet Sunday and remaining in the 8 to
12 ft range through early next week.
