.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level troughing will remain the dominant
influence across western Washington through much of the week as an
upper level low spins across the northeastern Pacific. This system
will push a few weak fronts into the area Tuesday and Wednesday,
bringing chances of showers to western Washington. More notable
chances of precipitation are expected Friday into the weekend as
the upper low pushes inland over the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level troughing will
continue to influence the region through the first half of the
week as an upper level low spins across the northeastern Pacific.

An upper level shortwave will move across the region today, while
a weak front approaches at the surface, breaking up as it gets
closer to the coast. Overall, expect today to be a mostly dry day
across western Washington. Onshore flow will continue in the low
levels, with increased cloud cover expected this morning as the
shortwave makes its way across the area. Clouds will make way for
some sunshine this afternoon and afternoon high temperatures will
be in the upper 60s to low 70s across the interior. Highs along
the coast will be in the low 60s.

The next frontal system will approach the region on Tuesday,
bringing chances of showers mainly to the coast. Overall rainfall
amounts look to be light, with most coastal areas only expected
to see a couple hundredths of an inch of rain. Afternoon highs
will be similar to Monday`s, with temperatures topping out in the
upper 60s to mid 70s across the interior and low 60s along the
coast.

The frontal system will then push inland Tuesday night into
Wednesday, bringing chances of showers and cloudy skies to the
interior. The bulk of the moisture with this system remains
focused on the Olympic Peninsula and across the North Cascades,
where up to a quarter of an inch of rain is possible. Most lowland
locations will see lighter amounts of a few hundredths of an
inch. High temperatures on Wednesday will be a few degrees cooler,
with most spots likely only climbing into the 60s, though a few
may make it into the low 70s.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...A few post-frontal showers may
linger into Thursday, but expect Thursday to be a drier day across
western Washington as a whole. The most notable precipitation of
the week is likely Friday into Saturday as the upper level low
across the northeastern Pacific sinks southward and moves inland
over the area Friday night into Saturday. Rainfall amounts across
the lowlands at this time generally look to range between a tenth
of an inch to a quarter of an inch. This cool system will bring
snow levels down to 5000-6000 ft over the weekend and looks to
bring light snow accumulations to the tallest mountain peaks.
Those with plans for outdoor recreation in the mountains will want
to make sure to stay tuned to the forecast over the coming days.
High temperatures over the weekend will generally trend below
normal as a result, with highs only expected to be in the 60s. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
