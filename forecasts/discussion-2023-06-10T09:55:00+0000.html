Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
555 AM EDT Sat Jun 10 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure builds into the area today and exits offshore
Sunday. Low pressure moves into the area from the west on Monday
and pushes a cold front through the area Monday night. Surface
low moves farther northeast of the area Tuesday into Tuesday
night. Another low approaches Wednesday into Wednesday night but
stays north of the area. Yet another low and associated cold
front approach and move in late Thursday into Friday.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
Forecast on track with only minor adjustments to reflect the
most recent observations.

The trough that was positioned over the area over the last week
finally lifts to the northeast giving way to rising heights and
weak ridging in the mid-levels. This will result in a mainly
dry and mostly sunny day with temperatures rising into the
middle to upper 70s. Though the trough departs today, some weak
instability may develop for northern portions of the area
allowing for a chance of an isolated shower into the afternoon.

Any shower dissipates tonight as weak surface high pressure
builds into the area from the south. A weak south flow develops
allowing for some subtle moisture advection into the area. Lows
tonight will be generally in the middle to upper 50s. the NYC
metro may not drop out of the low to middle 60s.

&&

.SHORT TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT/...
As mid-level ridging maximizes in the area on Sunday and a light
south to southwest flow develops, high temperatures are expected
to rise to at or above average for mid-June with much of the
areas highs in the low to middle 80s. Some spots in and around
the NYC metro may approach 90. General onshore flow will allow
for an increase in cloud cover ahead of the next developing
low pressure system to the west.

A surface low pressure system developing to the west on Sunday
will push a warm front moves through the area Sunday night and
into Monday. This will allow chances of showers to increase
through Sunday night into Monday morning. The cold front
approaches the area on Monday with highs in the middle to upper
70s. This warmth may allow for some weak instability to develop
toward the afternoon ahead of the cold front. This will enhance
the potential for more widespread moderate rainfall, especially
for the westernmost areas Monday afternoon into early evening.
The front progresses eastward Monday night and into early
Tuesday.

Right now, WPC has the western portions of the area in a
marginal risk for excessive rainfall for Monday afternoon and
into the evening. Rainfall totals of an inch are expected for
parts of the Lower Hudson Valley and into portions of NE NJ.

&&

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
In the mid levels, a large cutoff low approaches the region from the
west Tuesday through Tuesday night. At the surface, a secondary low,
as part of a well occluded parent low back in the Great Lakes, is
forecast to be moving farther northeast of the region Tuesday
through Tuesday night. The main parent low will also be moving
northeast as well. Chances for rain showers will remain in the
forecast for the region.

For Wednesday, the mid level cutoff low continues to approach from
the west but its center will stay north of the region. Here is where
the different numerical weather prediction exhibit differences with
respect to the speed of this feature. GFS keeps it more intact while
the ECMWF and Canadian models show the low becoming more progressive
and moving faster. The model differences carry into Wednesday night
with ECMWF and Canadian showing the low in the Canadian Maritimes by
early Thursday morning while the GFS keeps a slower speed to the low
and having it still in New England early Thursday. At the surface,
there is model agreement that the low approaching from the west
Wednesday into Wednesday night will not have much moisture with it
and will remain north of the area.

Rain showers will become more likely Wednesday along with a slight
chance of thunderstorms for the afternoon into early evening. Models
indicate some increase in low level instability for parts of the
region Wednesday afternoon. Rain shower chances decrease Wednesday
night as highest positive vorticity advection shifts farther east of
the region with the movement of the mid level low farther northeast
of the region. Brief high pressure at the surface will build in from
the south with slight height rises in the mid levels.

After brief weak high pressure and dry conditions late Wednesday
night into early Thursday, another low and associated front approach
and move for the late Thursday into Friday timeframe. This will
allow for a return of rain showers to the forecast. Slight chances
of thunderstorms are forecast for afternoon into evening hours both
Thursday and Friday with models indicating low level instability.

Daytime temperatures forecast to be near normal Tuesday, below
normal Wednesday, slightly above normal Thursday and Friday.

.AVIATION /10Z SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure gradually moves farther north of the region through the
TAF period allowing for a gradual entrance of high pressure from
the south.

Expecting mainly VFR conditions through the TAF period.

Winds will transition from NW or variable going into the morning
hours to sea breeze changing wind direction to more southerly
for some terminals while remaining more westerly for others in
the afternoon. Wind speeds remain near 5-10 kt much of the TAF
period. There will be a time period in the afternoon when winds
will be around 10 kt with some gusts up to 15-20 kt. These wind
gusts will subside by early evening as winds transition to more
westerly to southwesterly flow near 5-8 kt.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

KJFK and KLGA sea breeze timing could be off by 1-2 hours.

KEWR low chance for sea breeze early evening with NW winds
prevailing at KTEB.

Some gusts 15-20 kt possible in the afternoon for KJFK.


OUTLOOK FOR 06Z SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...

Late Tonight-Sunday: Mainly VFR.

Sunday night: Chance of showers and MVFR.

Monday: Showers and MVFR. Isolated thunderstorms afternoon into
evening. SE gusts 20-25 kt during the day. SE gusts near 20 kt in
the evening.

Tuesday: Chance of showers. Slight chance of thunderstorms afternoon
into early evening. MVFR possible. SW-W gusts 15-20 kt afternoon
into early evening.

Wednesday: Chance of showers. Slight chance of thunderstorms, mainly
in the afternoon into early evening. MVFR possible. SW gusts 15-20
kt.

.MARINE...
Sub-SCA conditions are expected through Sunday. Wind and waves
increase Sunday night ahead of the next low pressure system
approaching from the west. Gusts upwards of 25-30 kt become
possible on the ocean waters as early as 00Z Monday possibly
expanding to the sheltered waters during the afternoon. Winds
then diminish Monday night but waves on the ocean may be slow to
come down.

The marine forecast for Tuesday through Wednesday night will be a
time period of a relatively weak pressure gradient. This will keep
mainly below SCA conditions. Only exception is for Tuesday morning,
there is forecast to be SCA level ocean seas east of Fire Island
Inlet with otherwise sub-SCA conditions on all other waters. For
Tuesday afternoon through Wednesday night, sub-SCA conditions are
forecast for all waters.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
Around 1 inch of rainfall is expected for western portions of
the CWA Monday afternoon into Monday night. This may result in
minor street and poor drainage flooding. While flash flooding is
not expected, it can not be completely ruled out.

Otherwise, no widespread hydrologic impacts expected through
the end of the week.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
There is a moderate risk of rip currents for Suffolk beaches on
Saturday while other beaches at a low risk. All beaches are
under a moderate risk Sunday.

&&

.OKX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CT...None.
NY...None.
NJ...None.
MARINE...None.
