Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
845 AM PST Mon Nov 11 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A frontal system will move through the region through
this afternoon for lowland rain, mountain snow and the potential
of river flooding. Active weather will continue through the
remainder of the week, with more lowland rain, mountain snow,
potential river flooding, chances of thunder, and breezy
conditions. Troughing continues through the end of the week for
cooler conditions.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The current forecast
remains on track with no updates this morning. A frontal system
will continue to move through western Washington this morning,
with snow levels currently high, over 6000 feet. As we progress
into the afternoon, snow levels will start to decrease to around
4000-5000 feet. Snow accumulations at SR 20 and Washington Pass
will still be possible and may be heavy at times, therefore the
Winter Weather Advisory for the North Cascades will still remain
in effect. Steady rain will transition to showers later this
afternoon as the frontal system passes through into Tuesday. The
air mass continues to remain unstable, therefore a chance of
thunderstorms will remain along the coast also into Tuesday.
Additionally, strong waves of anywhere around 15 to 20 feet
approaching the coastline tonight may generate high surf
conditions.

Showers remain into Tuesday before a wetter and stronger system
moves through into Wednesday, continuing lowland rain and high
elevation snow, with snow levels above 4500 feet. Another period
of breezy southerly winds are possible Wednesday afternoon, mainly
for the coast and areas north of Everett. Continuous rainfall
over the area renews the potential for river flooding, as several
rivers are still forecasted to reach Action stage, with a few
possibly getting close to Minor Flooding during this time. Refer
to the Hydrology section below for details relating to river
flooding. In addition, coastal flooding along the coast may be a
concern with seas still running somewhat high (around 10 to 15
feet).

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Deep troughing will
continue over the region with continuous rain turning into
showers. At this point, rivers will have likely have crested and
receded. This aforementioned deep troughing will keep a chance of
thunder along the coast, mainly ending by Friday morning. Snow
levels look to lower into the weekend, around 2500-3000 feet, with
accumulating snowfall at Stevens and Snoqualmie pass likely. More
lowland rain and mountain snow will continue as latest cluster
guidance shows additional upper level troughing across the Pacific
Northwest.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft will continue today as a
frontal system moves onshore across Western Washington this morning.
The air mass will become somewhat unstable behind the front with low
level offshore flow turning onshore. A mix of MVFR and VFR ceilings
in rain will become mostly VFR this afternoon in scattered showers
with isolated thunderstorms near the coast.

KSEA...VFR ceilings with scattered showers. Surface winds
southerly at 10 to 15 knots with gusts to 20 kt. 33/27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system will sweep inland early this morning
with small craft advisory winds expected all waters. A stronger
front arrives Tuesday night with gales possible coast, entrances
to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and the Northern Inland waters
beginning Tuesday afternoon.

Seas will build today and peak around 15 to 20 feet tonight into
Tuesday keeping small craft advisories in effect for the coastal
waters into Tuesday afternoon.

Conditions are slated to remain active the remainder of the week
as a parade of disturbances enters the region. Felton/27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Widespread showers (some moderate to heavy at times)
will continue Monday, and again Wednesday as an active weather
pattern remains. The precipitation amounts will be strongly
orographically influenced with precipitation totals in the mountains
expected to be 3 to 5 inches for both storms except locally over 6
inches on the Olympics for the last one (Wednesday).

The succession of storms will increasingly build up soil moisture
and river levels throughout this period which will increase the
possibility for river flooding. Snow levels vary generally from 4000
to 6000 feet which will impact precipitation type and affect the
amount of storm runoff.

For other rivers, significant rises are expected with several river
forecast points above Action Stage, and flooding could be possible,
especially in the Northern and Central Cascades. Flooding extent
will continue to depend on rainfall rates, temperatures, as well as
snow levels with precipitation that rises and falls with each of
these weather systems next week. We will continue to assess the
hydrologic conditions and forecasts for any additional areas of
potential flooding as they arise.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
