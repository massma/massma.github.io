Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
818 PM PDT Thu May 8 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Dry and relatively warm weather will linger into
Friday. The pattern will begin to shift late Friday setting the
stage for a cooler, showery pattern for much of the weekend. A
more organized frontal system looks to bring more widespread
- even stratiform rain later Sunday into Monday. The pattern
next week may be dominated by an offshore ridge, and cooler
Spring like weather.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery
shows some more mid to high level cloud cover streaming in across
western Washington this evening in association with a warm front
well offshore. Overall, the forecast remains largely on track
tonight with no updates needed to the short and long term public
forecast. The previous discussion follows below, with updates made
to the aviation section. 14

Upper level ridging settling into the area with dry and warm
conditions coming along with it into Friday. High temperatures
into Friday will reach to near 70 for many locations through the
interior from King County Southward, and low to mid 60s elsewhere.
The pattern will begin to shift Saturday with the upper level
ridge starting to nudge eastward, ahead of an approaching upper
level trough. This will set the stage for a cooler, showery
pattern Saturday with highs in the 50s to the mid 60s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The offshore upper level
low is expected to shift more fully southward on Sunday - though
ensembles vary a bit on the track and strength with some taking a
more direct westward track, while others a more southeasterly path
into Oregon. Either way Sunday looks to see more widespread
shower activity - and a slight chance of thunderstorms later in
the afternoon and evening. Grand ensembles generally agree on the
upper level trough lingering over the Pacific Northwest into
Monday before gradually shifting east into Monday night. This will
most likely keep Monday cooler and showery. The grand ensemble
continues to show some degree of offshore ridging becoming
established Tuesday into midweek which would keep the Pacific
Northwest under northerly flow aloft with some chance of showers
possible - and slightly cooler than normal temperatures at least
into midweek.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A west to southwest zonal flow pattern will continue
over western WA tonight into Friday with the strongest winds
offshore (in a jet core). VFR conditions will continue this evening
into Friday as high cirrus/stratus builds in over most terminals
tonight. This will recede back to along the coast Friday morning
(may be accompanied by some low MVFR stratus just offshore the
Pacific Coastline) but otherwise more high clouds will build in the
afternoon. Surface winds continue out of the north this evening at 8
to 12 knots, and will decrease below 5 kt tonight through Friday
morning, picking back up out of the northwest at 5 to 10 kt.

KSEA...VFR will continue with high clouds at times through Friday.
North winds 8 to 12 knots this afternoon will ease after 06z to
under 5 kt overnight through Friday night, and pick up out of the
northwest 5 to 10 kt late Friday morning.

.MARINE...Surface high pressure over the coastal waters will lead
to generally benign marine conditions through Friday. A series of
weak systems will cross over the waters over the weekend and into
early next week, resulting in periodic increases in onshore flow
over the area waters. Possible headlines over the weekend could
include pushes down the Strait of Juan De Fuca, but not confident
at this time.

Coastal seas 4 to 6 feet into the weekend and into the early half
of next week.
