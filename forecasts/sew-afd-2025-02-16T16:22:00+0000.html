.SYNOPSIS...A frontal system will continue to push through
Western Washington today into Monday bringing lowland rain and
mountain snow. Wet and unsettled conditions will persist into
late next week, as additional systems are expected to impact the
region.

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Snow continues to fall over the Cascades with snowfall
rates of up to 1/2 an inch per hour continuing through the
morning. Will taper into the afternoon before the rates pick back
up later tonight/Monday morning. A little bit of snow will fall
over the Olympics today. All remaining lowland areas will continue
to see bands of rain showers off and on today.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Radar imagery shows light
to moderate showers moving across Western WAshington early this
morning. Lowland rain and mountain snow are expected to continue
today into Monday as an upper level trough pushes through the
region. This weather system will bring significant snow
accumulation to the passes today (now) into Monday morning. HREF
ensemble guidance shows snow accumulations on the lower end (10th
percentile) of 12-13 inches at the passes, while 20-23 inches on
the higher end (90th percentile). When looking at probabilities,
there is a 70-90% chance of seeing at least a foot of snow at the
passes through Monday morning. Ergo, a Winter Weather Warning
remains in effect for the Cascades until Monday morning (10 AM).
Snow levels are currently hovering around 1500-1800 ft and will
gradually rise above 3500 ft by Monday afternoon, which may result
in a rain/snow mix near the passes. Rain and mountain snow
showers will linger into Monday afternoon/evening hours, however
accumulations will be light.

A weak upper level ridge will move onshore on Tuesday, bringing
slightly drier conditions, but it will not be strong enough to
completely dry out Western Washington. The ridge will quickly
push east as an upper level trough will move onshore Tuesday
night, bringing rain along the coast. Snow levels early Tuesday
morning will be around 3000 ft along the passes; however they are
expected to decrease to as low as 1500-2000 ft by Tuesday night.

High temperatures will generally be in the high 40s to low 50s,
while low temperatures will in the upper 30s to low 40s in the
lowlands.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...The aforementioned
upper level trough will continue to push east. This system will
bring widespread lowland rain and mountain snow on Wednesday. Snow
levels on on Wednesday morning will be around 1500-2000 ft and
gradually rise to around 3000 ft by the afternoon. As for snow
accumulations there is uncertainty with the system being far out
into next week. However, the NBM`s 10th percentile currently is
showing around 0-4 inches of snow along the passes, while the 90th
percentile shows around 14-15 inches are possible by Wednesday
night.

There is good agreement between long- range models that wet
conditions will persist into late next week, as additional systems
are expected to move through Western Washington. Temperatures
will continue to get warmer as we head into the weekend. High
temperatures on Wednesday will be in the high 40s to low 50s in
the lowlands. By Saturday, temperatures will be in the low to mid
50s. Low temperatures will generally be in the low 40s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface trough will shift inland tonight. High
pressure builds over the region late Monday onto Tuesday. Next
fronts reach the area Tuesday night into Wednesday and Thursday.

Small craft advisory continuing through Monday night for the
coastal waters with seas 9 to 14 feet subsiding under 10 feet late
Monday night and Tuesday morning. Small craft advisory winds
expected over at least the coastal waters and the Strait of Juan
de Fuca with the next front Tuesday night into Wednesday. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...A series of storm systems will move across western
Washington this week bringing several rounds of modest
precipitation to the area. Snow levels will remain in the 3000-
4000 ft range until late in the week. A warmer and wetter system
next weekend could result in more widespread river rises and the
possibility of flooding along the Skokomish River. Until then no
flooding is forecast but the Skokomish could rise into Action
Stage late tonight into Monday and remain there through the week.
