Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
344 PM PST Tue Feb 25 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Conditions will begin to dry into Wednesday as upper
level ridging builds over our area with warmer temperatures. A
weak front looks to approach the region on Thursday for some light
showers before it weakens. Ridging builds on Friday for drier
conditions, before troughing retakes the pattern for light
precipitation over the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Recent radar imagery
depicts convergence zone activity mainly in central Snohomish
County, right over Monroe and Sultan. Locally higher rainfall
totals can be possible in any heavier banding that develops due to
the zone later this afternoon. The convergence zone activity will
linger until the evening hours, before it dissipates with all
other shower activity across western Washington. Along with rain
showers, breezy winds across the area will gradually taper into
the evening. Mountain snow will also lessen into the overnight
hours, as the Winter Storm Warning for the cascades will expire at
4PM.

Upper level ridging will build into Wednesday allowing for
conditions to dry out across the region and temperatures to warm.
Moisture still sticking around from the previous system will
likely promote fog development across the interior by early
Wednesday morning. High temperatures on Wednesday range from the
upper 50s, even potentially hitting 60 in some spots - with some
sun breaks possible!

A splitting front looks to approach our area on Thursday but will
weaken as it splits. A few showers are possible across the area
but will be light, at a few hundredths of an inch. High
temperatures on Thursday will remain the same, generally in the
upper 50s. Ridging returns on Friday for drier conditions across
the area with temperatures remaining stagnant.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The aforementioned ridging
will shift eastward allowing for troughing to retake the pattern
once again over the weekend with the chance of showers each day.
At this time, precipitation looks generally light and there is no
indication of any significant impacts through the long term
period.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A mostly MVFR ceilings across the region this afternoon
with some residual showers across portions of the area. One
exception is the strong Puget Sound Convergence Zone that has
developed across mostly Snohomish County this afternoon with locally
lower ceilings/visibility and heavier rain. Meanwhile, gusty winds
across the interior have begun to subside from the earlier peak
strength. Some clearing overnight, paired with abundant low-level
moisture, will lead to some areas of fog from KPWT through KOLM with
around a 20% chance for the Seattle areas terminals. Mostly dry
conditions and decreasing clouds during the day Wednesday with high
pressure building overhead.

KSEA...Continued rain will maintain IFR to lower MVFR visibility and
ceilings through the remainder of the morning with gusty south
surface winds. Expect winds to ease late this afternoon and evening,
before becoming easterly or northeasterly at 5 kt overnight. With
some slight breaking up of the lower clouds overnight, around a 20%
chance of IFR fog developing toward 12z Wednesday.    Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Winds have gradually eased from the maximum speeds
earlier today, with small craft advisories remaining in effect for
winds for the interior zones into the evening or early morning. This
generally decreasing trend will continue. Otherwise, seas remain
around 18 to 20 feet over the coastal waters and will slowly
diminish through Wednesday. The coastal SCAs will largely be for
seas as opposed to winds through tomorrow, though some 20-25 kt
winds are possible over the outer coastal waters. High pressure will
begin to build over the waters tomorrow, with a weak frontal system
approaching the coastal waters by early Thursday.      Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A new flood warning has been issued for the Chehalis
River at Grand Mound in Thurston County. Rainfall will diminish this
evening but previous precipitation will be enough to push the river
up to minor flood stage Wednesday morning through Thursday. A flood
warning remains in effect for the Skokomish River near Potlatch in
Mason county. The river has crested in moderate flood stage category
and will remain above flood stage now through Friday. A flood watch
remains in effect for Lewis and Grays Harbor counties as rises
remain along additional points of the Chehalis and Newaukum River.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
