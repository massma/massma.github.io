Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
916 PM PDT Sat Jul 20 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Mostly dry and warm conditions will continue across
western Washington through the weekend. A weak shortwave bring
spotty showers to the Olympic and Cascade mountains on Sunday
along with the potential for elevated thunderstorms. An upper
level trough moving into British Columbia early next week will
cool temperatures closer to seasonal norms and increase night and
morning cloudiness.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Forecast remains on track
tonight with no updates required. Previous short term section
follows.

An upper-level ridge is amplifying over the Inland Northwest and
bringing the warmest temperatures we`ll see for the foreseeable
future this afternoon. Upstream, an upper-low is spinning
offshore. We`re right in between these features under south-
southwesterly flow aloft. For tonight, overnight lows will drop
into the 50s areawide but urban heat island should keep the
Seattle metro in the lower 60s. Looming offshore, a shortwave
ejecting out of the aforementioned upper-low will bring increased
chances for elevated convection, possibly producing thunderstorm
for the Olympic and Cascade mountains.

As mentioned, a shortwave will bring the chance for elevated
convection on Sunday. There isn`t bountiful moisture but
instability is present as model derived mid-level lapse rates are
7-8 C/km. With orographic enhancement overlaid with diurnal
heating, the potential isn`t out of the question from being
realized. A dry slot in the lower levels should keep rainfall
from making it to the surface for lowland locations. Hi-res CAMs
have this activity pushing from west to east throughout day on
Sunday, possibly lingering late into Sunday night over the
Cascades. With dry fuels the concern for new fire starts must be
expressed (see the fire weather section down below). Going into
Monday and Tuesday, the pattern looks to flip. Stout low-level
onshore flow looks to set up bringing temperatures down to near
average for the first time it was has been weeks! High temps look to
generally be in the mid to upper 70s for the interior and low 60s
for the coast. Can`t rule out some lower 80s for the Cascade
valleys.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...The broad upper level
trough will continue to influence our weather through the long term,
with periods of onshore flow, morning stratus, and temperatures
near season normals. Temperatures look to stay in the 70s for the
interior and the 60s for coastal locations. As of right now, there
looks to be nothing in the way of any meaningful precipitation.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong upper ridge shifts eastward into Sunday with
an upper level trough approaching with southerly flow aloft.
Generally clear skies over the interior except for a few pockets
of elevated haze from regional fires. A marginally stronger
onshore push tonight will to allow for the marine layer to make it
further inland Sunday morning. Guidance has stratus making it
just west of Puget Sound by early the early Sunday morning hours.
Terminals in stratus will likely see a few hours of IFR conditions.
Mid to high level cloud cover will then filter overhead during
the day Sunday as a shortwave skirts the area. Northerly surface
winds look to transition to south/southwesterly Sunday morning,
most likely between 12-15Z.

KSEA...VFR conditions. Surface winds north to northeasterly,
persisting at 7-10 knots. Winds will become light overnight and
transition to the south/southwest between 12-15Z. Stratus looks to
stay west of the terminal Sunday morning. Mid to high level
clouds streaming overhead on Sunday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Broad surface ridging remains situated over the offshore
waters with lower pressure situated across the interior of western
Washington. Thermally induced lower pressure will shift eastward
tonight, allowing for a marine push to bring small craft advisory
westerlies to the central and eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca.
Onshore flow will increase on Sunday and could bring the potential
for small craft advisory strength northwesterlies across portions
of the coastal waters in addition to westerly gales for the
central and eastern Strait Sunday afternoon and evening. Onshore
flow will then continue through much of the next week as a low
pressure system gradually moves across British Columbia.

Seas over the coastal waters will build toward 4-6 ft on Sunday
and remain increasingly choppy with dominant periods remaining
short (around 6 or 7 seconds). Seas will then subside and hover
between 3-5 ft by late Monday and persist at this range through
much of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A Red Flag Warning has been issued for zones
652, 661, 658, and 659 which goes into the effect on Sunday. A
weak disturbance will bring a threat for scattered elevated
thunderstorms over receptive fuels. Precipitation should end by
late Sunday night into early Monday morning. Will continue to
monitor the situation as the conditions evolve. A cooler and more
humid pattern develops Monday as an upper level trough settles
over the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
