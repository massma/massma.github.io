.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low spinning across the Pacific
Northwest will continue to bring chances of snow showers to
western Washington through Thursday before pushing inland on
Friday. A weak system moving across the area over the weekend
will keep conditions showery across western Washington. Cold,
below normal temperatures will persist across the area into early
next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low will
continue to circulate offshore today and Thursday before pushing
inland on Friday. This will continue to bring chances of snow
showers to western Washington through at least Thursday.

Radar shows some snow showers gradually moving northward across
western Washington early this morning. Current temperatures range
in the mid 20s to low 30s and are expected to fall into the 20s
areawide over the next few hours. Expect another round of icy
conditions across the region as any lingering moisture on area
roadways is likely to refreeze overnight. Shower activity will
continue across the interior through the early morning hours, with
the heaviest activity generally expected to remain along the
Pacific coast. Wind chill readings are mostly in the teens across
western Whatcom and the San Juan Islands as Fraser Outflow winds
remain gusty. Cold weather advisories remain in effect through
mid morning as a result. Expect Fraser Outflow to gradually
subside today as gradients start to relax.

The attention then turns to the increasing potential of more
widespread accumulating snowfall this afternoon into early
Thursday as the upper level low offshore moves eastward and
pushes more moisture into the area. Latest HREF guidance pinpoints
the next round of snow showers starting to move north into
western Washington starting this afternoon. While it`s tough to
pinpoint exactly where the heaviest snowfall will occur, this next
round has the potential to bring more widespread accumulating
snowfall to areas across the interior, especially from Olympia to
Arlington, than what we have seen over the last several days.
While uncertainty in exact snow amounts still exists, the latest
NBM probabilities indicate roughly a 40-60 percent chance of at
least 1 inch of snow falling for areas from Chehalis to Everett.
Percentages drop at 2 inches, with much of the I-5 corridor
showing a 25 to 40 percent chance of snow amounts reaching 2
inches or greater. The most likely scenario in regards to snow
amounts for the interior lowlands at this time is roughly half an
inch to 1 inch, though locally higher snow amounts will be
possible in any heavier precipitation or banding that develops.
The other complicating factor will be just how quickly
temperatures fall to freezing tonight - with the most likely
period for accumulating snowfall remaining late tonight into
early Thursday. Snow will taper areawide Thursday morning as the
upper low offshore sinks southward towards OR and northern CA and
pulls the available moisture with it and out of the area.

A brief, somewhat drier period is expected to commence across
western Washington Thursday afternoon as the upper low continues
to sink southward out of the area. Clearing skies on Thursday will
bring significant cooling to western Washington Thursday night,
with morning lows on Friday expected to dip down into the low to
mid 20s areawide. A few spots may even see lows drop down into
the teens. Chances of snow showers increase again Friday afternoon
and evening as the upper low pushes inland over northern CA and
pushes some wrap-around moisture back up into western Washington.
Most of the moisture looks to remain situated across the southern
two- thirds of the CWA, with additional snow amounts Friday night
into Saturday generally looking to be anywhere from a trace to
half an inch across portions of the area at this time.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Guidance continues to
trend showery over the weekend as a shortwave drops down into
western Washington from the north on Saturday. Western Washington
then looks to remain under more of a troughing influence heading
into early next week, keeping overall temperatures cooler and the
potential for showers in the forecast. While a spread in the
temperature forecast remains, expect temperatures to remain below
normal through much of the long term. Highs generally look to
top out in the mid 30s to near 40 with overnight lows looking to
trend in the 20s to low 30s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly to southerly flow aloft as an upper
level low continues to churn offshore. Scattered snow showers
across western Washington early this morning for a mix of MVFR/IFR
conditions across area terminals. Could see even LIFR, briefly,
in heavier snow showers with decreased visibilities 1-3SM. Out of
showers, conditions relatively will persist at VFR otherwise.
Another band of precipitation will push through the Puget Sound
terminals generally around 19z-22z which will bring another round
of snow showers with occasional conditions lowered to MVFR/IFR,
perhaps even lower briefly in snow and fog.

Gusty Fraser Outflow winds continue to affect KBLI early this
morning, but will gradually decrease into the early part of the
afternoon with northeast winds 8 to 12 knots. Elsewhere, can
expect northeasterly winds 5 to 10 knots this afternoon
switching more southerly into this evening.

KSEA...VFR at the terminal this morning with light snow showers.
These showers are very light and do not seem to be causing any
reduction in ceilings at the moment. This trend will continue
throughout the morning as VFR will likely persist. An additional
band of snow showers will near the terminal around 21z-23z for a
likely decrease in conditions and visibilities ranging from
MVFR/IFR. These showers may initially start as rain/snow mix, but
will settle into snow near 00z. Latest hi-res guidance shows
these scattered showers continuing through 03z-05z where MVFR will
continue.

N/NE wind this morning around 8 to 12 knots may switch southerly
briefly this morning (13z-17z), before turning back northerly
around 20-23z ranging from 4 to 8 knots, then settling into a
southerly direction after 00z. Latest hi-res guidance is
struggling on the exact timings of wind shifts, but it is due to
the aforementioned band of snow showers and exact placement.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface trough will continue to remain over the
coastal waters with surface ridging in place over British
Columbia. Fraser River outflow winds are still in place over the
Northern Interior Waters, the Central/West Strait of Juan De Fuca,
and the adjacent inner coastal waters. Outflow winds will decrease
later this morning as the small craft advisory will be allowed to
expire. Light offshore flow will continue through most of the
water zones into the end of the week.

Combined seas around 3 to 6 feet will continue into the end of the
week.
