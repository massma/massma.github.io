Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
302 AM PST Sun Dec 1 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will continue to amplify into western
Washington into early next week, allowing for dry conditions and
periods of morning fog and low stratus. The upper ridge will
weaken towards the middle of next week as the next storm system
approaches, bringing in the next chance for widespread
precipitation across the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will continue
to amplify northward into western Washington throughout the
weekend and into early next week. This will maintain dry
conditions across the forecast area with patchy fog and low
stratus developing each morning, primarily southwest of the Puget
Sound and across the Chehalis Valley. There will be little change
to the overall weather pattern day-to-day, with highs in the
upper 40s to lower 50s and lows near freezing across the lowlands.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...The upper level ridge
will start to break down by Wednesday, with ensembles bringing in
the next chances for widespread precipitation on Thursday and
Friday. This incoming system will bring in warmer temperatures
peaking in the mid to upper 50s for most areas with a more active
weather pattern favored to return by next weekend. Preliminary
precipitation totals are light with the bulk of the incoming
moisture focused over the Olympic Peninsula and northern Cascades.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge will continue to build over Western
Washington today with west to northwest flow aloft. The low level
flow is light offshore. Areas of LIFR in fog and/or low stratus is
expected across south Puget Sound, the Southwest Interior, Hood
Canal, and outlying river valleys before dissipating 18Z-20Z. VFR is
expected this afternoon. More widespread LIFR in fog is expected to
form across the interior lowlands tonight into Monday morning.

KSEA...Satellite trends as of 09Z suggest that low cloud coverage in
TAF will need to be trimmed back. Current thinking is a 20-30%
chance of Lake Washington stratus drifting toward the airfield
briefly this morning between 13Z-16Z. Otherwise, VFR expected for
the remainder of the day. Clearing skies tonight and flat gradients
through Puget Sound point toward a higher likelihood of LIFR in fog
for a period on Monday morning. Surface winds N/NE generally under 6
knots.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure at the surface and aloft will remain across
the coastal and interior waters into midweek. A weak front is slated
to reach the waters on Thursday with a modestly stronger one to
follow on Friday.
