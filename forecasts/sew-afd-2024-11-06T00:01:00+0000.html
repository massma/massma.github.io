Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
401 PM PST Tue Nov 5 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge will begin to bring drier
conditions to the area tonight and over the next couple days. A
series of systems will bring rain, mountain snow, chance of
thunder, and breezy winds starting on Thursday evening and
continue through mid next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Current radar shows weak
convergence tapering off across King County and Kitsap Peninsula
this afternoon. This activity will taper off through this evening as
an upper level ridge begins to build over the area. Expect a
gradual rebound in high temperatures for the next coming days
with the upper level ridge situated over Western Washington, with
high temperatures bouncing back into the mid to upper 50s by
Thursday afternoon. Also, mostly clear skies and light winds
during the nightfall may lead to the formation of patchy fog and
patchy frost along some areas in the southern interior on
Wednesday morning. Patchy fog is possible on Thursday morning
along the southern portions of Puget Sound and widespread patchy
frost is possible in the southern interior.

An upper level trough will begin to descend from the Gulf of
Alaska bringing another round of unsettled weather to Western
Washington. Ensemble guidance shows precipitation moving into the
coast as early as Thursday afternoon. This system will bring the
chance of rain, mountain snow, and breezy winds into Friday. Rain
will become gradually more widespread into Thursday night and
continue throughout the day on Friday.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The weather system
previously mentioned will continue to impact Western Washington
bringing rain, mountain snow, breezy winds. A cold front is
expected to move through Western Washington on Saturday. The cold
air behind the cold front may promote the generation of
thunderstorms along the coast (10-15% probability). On Sunday
another round of unsettled weather will move over the region as
another upper level trough moves towards the area. A stronger cold
front may decrease snow levels down to 3000-3500 ft for Sunday
and Monday morning. As a result, some of the mountain passes may
see a few inches of snow. Unsettled conditions are expected to
continue through Tuesday.

There is some uncertainty among the model guidance on the
rainfall and snowfall accumulations, however there is general
agreement that the highest precipitation accumulations will be
along the coast and mountains. At this time there is a 30-50%
probability of wind gusts exceeding 30 MPH on Saturday and Sunday,
along the coast and the Strait of Juan de Fuca. If you`re
traveling over the Cascade Passes this weekend into early next
week, make sure to continue to monitor the weather forecasts.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow aloft shifting more northerly as
upper level ridging shifts eastward, even though the ridge axis
remains off the coast. Most terminals have seen winds shift to
northerly this afternoon with speeds generally 4-8 kts. CLM and HQM
remain westerly with speeds ranging 6-12 kts and will likely remain
that way for the remainder of the afternoon. Speeds for these
terminals will ease tonight with direction becoming more easterly.

VFR conditions over most of the area, however MVFR conditions being
reported at PAE and BFI thanks to a very persistent PSCZ. As this
feature very gradually shifts southward, PAE may return to VFR while
BFI may see these conditions linger into the early evening. Current
thinking is that SEA should not see much impact from this, given
both the slow southward movement and the hopefully limited life span
left for this feature. That said, not enough confidence present for
inclusion in SEA TAF. Models continue to suggest MVFR to IFR
conditions for terminals more prone to lower cigs overnight and
early Wednesday morning...however are steering away from any
significant lower cigs for terminals east of the Sound. Will still
leave some scattered low clouds for some of these terminals as this
seems most probably, but would also serve as a good starting point
should future amendments be needed.

KSEA...VFR conditions in place and will remain for most, if not all,
the TAF period. PSCZ to the north not expected to impact the
terminal and due to low confidence in that prospect, will not
include this feature in TAF at this time. Winds have shifted to
northerly with speeds generally 4-8 kts and will shift more
northeasterly tonight before becoming light and variable early
Wednesday morning.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Seas will continue to ease and as such, current SCA for
the coastal waters and west entrance will be allowed to expire this
afternoon. Surface ridging over the coastal and offshore waters will
shift inland tonight with light offshore flow developing. A warm
front will brush the coastal waters early tonight and high pressure
will remain over the waters Wednesday and Thursday. A weakening
front will arrive on Friday before a stronger system sweeps across
the waters Friday night into Saturday.

Seas 6 to 8 ft and will continue to slowly subside getting to 5 to 7
ft tonight. They should remain in this general range before starting
to increase Thursday evening ahead of a series of frontal systems
expected to pass through the waters over the weekend.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The next chance of significant precipitation is
forecasted to arrive Saturday through Monday. At this time, the
Skokomish River is the only river forecasted to rise above flood
stage. For other rivers, flooding could be possible, but at this
time is not forecasted. The amount of flooding will depend on
rainfall rates, temperatures and snow levels with precipitation that
falls with these systems.
