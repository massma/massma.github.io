Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
323 PM PDT Sun May 25 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Increasing cloud cover this afternoon across Western
Washington as the next front approaches. This front crosses the
region tonight through early Monday, bringing cooler temperatures
and a round of showers. High pressure rebuilds over the region
Tuesday and Wednesday with another notable warm up. Another front
Thursday brings another brief pause, but a return of warmer and
dry conditions is expected to return late in the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Increasing clouds
are already beginning to filter into the region with light
returns on radar pushing close to the far north coast this
afternoon. Expect showers to continue to reach the coastline
this evening before pushing inland overnight and into early
Monday morning. QPF remains rather limited with highest totals
in the mountains and along the coast, as shadowing with further
limit totals across the Puget Sound region to a few hundredths
of an inch at best. The bigger impact to sensible weather will
be the somewhat cooler temperatures across the region on Monday
under the cloud cover and cooler air mass. However, heights will
begin to quickly rebound late Monday and into Tuesday as the
ridge builds over the Pacific Northwest. This will bring
temperatures back up into the mid to upper 60s along the and
into the 70s in the interior.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Wednesday will be a very
warm one, with the ridge axis shifting east and thermal low
pressure building into the interior portions of western
Washington. This will bring a Moderate (Orange) level of
HeatRisk to much of the region as high temperatures climb into
the upper 70s to mid 80s away from the immediate coastline.
Temperatures may initially be slow to cool down Wednesday
evening, but another front will likely bring additional clouds
and light showers into Thursday. As with the first front this
week, the largest impact will likely be increased clouds and
slightly cooler temperatures as rain looks to be quite light.
Good agreement in the ensemble guidance suggesting a return of
high pressure aloft late in the week maintaining dry conditions
and above normal temperatures for the late portions of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper-ridge east of the area continues to progress off
and away this afternoon. SW flow aloft through tonight, then veering
westerly into Monday as a trough tracks overhead. Low-level onshore
will increase during this time. As a response, MVFR stratus will
start along the coast around 06z, spreading inland after 12z with
light showers. Any lingering low clouds should lift and scatter to
VFR by 18-20z Monday. VFR again likely Monday night.


KSEA...VFR with mid to high clouds overhead. Ceilings will gradually
lower tonight as low-level onshore increase. MVFR cigs are trending
likely between 14-17z before lifting and scattering back to VFR
thereafter. More VFR into Monday night as well. S-SW surface winds 5-
10 kt with isolated gusts near 15 kt at times.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the waters becoming less of an
influence this evening. A weak front remains forecast to enter
tonight through Monday morning. HREF guidance indicates a 20-40%
chance small craft advisory sustained winds in Central and Eastern
Strait Monday afternoon. A better chance exists for gusts.
Afterwards, high pressure will rebuild in its wake Monday night and
Tuesday. A thermally induced surface trough will move up the
coastline Tuesday night then shift inland Wednesday. A front will
dissipate over the coastal waters Wednesday night into Thursday with
another chance of headlined winds through the strait.
