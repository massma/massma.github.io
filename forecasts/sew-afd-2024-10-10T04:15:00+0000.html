.SYNOPSIS...A few lingering showers will continue to trail a
departing disturbance this afternoon across most of western
Washington. The pattern will become drier and warmer as upper
level ridging builds into the region from Thursday into the
weekend. Expect the pattern to transition back to cool and
unsettled by middle by next week as the ridging is replaced with a
trough.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...A weak upper level trough
is sliding north over far northern Washington/B.C. Canada this
afternoon. There is just enough dynamical support a few isolated
showers continue post-front off the coast up into Vancouver
Island. These will continue to move inland and affect areas
primarily north of I-90 and the Olympics. Additionally, an
isolated thunderstorm off the coastline cannot be ruled out
(lightning has been detected off the coastline off of Neah Bay but
but the thunder is not expected to make it inland). Precipitation
amounts are extremely light for today (several hundredths inland
to over a tenth along the coast). Places that do not see showers
this afternoon will see intervals of clouds and sunshine, as the
high cirrostratus/cirrocumulus clouds move out. Temperatures will
settle in the upper 50s to low 60s this afternoon.

The remainder of this week into the weekend looks dry and pleasant
without any weather makers passing over our region. Flow aloft
will become more zonal with the jet pattern up in Canada Thursday
and Friday, building into a ridge over Washington and B.C. as a
split low cuts underneath, and a low deepens off of Alaska. As a
result, the weather Thursday into Saturday will be completely dry.
Thursday afternoon and late Friday into Saturday appear to be the
sunniest days in the forecast. In between, a mix of clouds will
block out some of the clear sky. Additionally, there will be the
potential for some patchy fog each morning with weak flow aloft,
partially clear skies in the morning and light winds. The warmest
temperatures will arrive by Friday/Saturday, as highs in most
areas will peak in the upper 60s to low 70s. This will put most
places around 5 to 10 degrees above normal temperatures (for this
time in October).

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Sunday continues the
pleasant weather from Saturday as the ridge is expected to peak in
its build over the region Sunday morning. Most ensembles are
showing the ridge beginning to exit the region by Monday/Tuesday
(though this may speed up or slow depending on if a low develops
over the Great Lakes). Western Washington will most likely see the
return of cooler and wetter conditions Monday into Wednesday, as
a trough from Alaska begins to track towards our area.
Predictability of precipitation amounts with this system remain
challenging to pinpoint this far out, but it appears most areas
will receive a modest amount of precipitation next week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level trough dissipating this evening. Westerly
flow aloft becoming more southwesterly Thursday with upper level
ridge building over the area.

VFR conditions over the northern portion of the area with ceilings
near 6000 feet. Mostly clear skies over the southern portion of
the area. Clouds scattering out over the northern portion
overnight. Patchy low stratus ( IFR ceilings ) forming around 12z
Thursday. Patchy fog also developing over the Southwest Interior
with ceilings below 200 feet and visibility below 1 mile. Whatever
does form will be gone by 18z with just some high clouds for the
remainder of the day.

KSEA...Mostly clear skies into the early morning hours. Tough call
on low stratus in the morning with surface gradients going light
northerly. With a 20 percent chance or less of stratus at the
terminal have just gone with a scattered cloud deck around 500
feet for a few hours between 13z-17z. Southerly winds less than 6
knots becoming northeasterly around 12z. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...Light low level onshore flow will turn offshore on
Thursday as high pressure shifts inland. With light winds and seas
until the next system late in the week. This system will weaken
offshore on Friday - with low level flow remaining offshore through
the weekend. Seas will generally remain in the ballpark of 4 to 6
feet through the weekend.
