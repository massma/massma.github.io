Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
552 PM EDT Sun Sep 1 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
A pre-frontal trough over the area will be pushed eastward by a cold
frontal passage tonight. High pressure will then build east through
the middle of the week, gradually moving offshore mid to late next
week. A frontal system may approach the area Friday into next
weekend.

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM MONDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Gradual drying and clearing across NYC and points N&W in wake
of pre-frontal trough this evening, with shra/tstm threat having
now ended and exited east (with the exception of a few light
showers left over in far eastern areas of the CWA). These drying
conds will gradually slide eastward through the evening.

Otherwise, cold front approaches this evening and crosses
tonight, with gusty N/NW winds bringing in a much drier Canadian
airmass.

Overall, timing of the sfc trough has been slightly quicker to
exit than originally anticipated. For this evening`s forecast
update, sky cover and POPs have been lowered through the rest of
the evening along with minor adjustments to hourly temperatures
and dewpoints.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM MONDAY MORNING THROUGH TUESDAY/...
Northern stream trough will slowly slide over the region Monday into
Monday Night and gradually east on Tuesday. At the surface,
high pressure gradually build in from the west on Monday and
then overhead on Tuesday.

Dry and seasonably warm conditions on Monday with gusty N/NW winds
and sct aft/eve cu development ahead of approaching secondary cold
front. Secondary cold front crosses Mon eve with reinforcing
short of Canadian airmass. The mixed low-levels should keep
temps from radiatively bottoming out, but still lows in the 40s
across outlying areas and 50s NYC/NJ metro.

Sunny and slightly below seasonable temps on Tuesday as heart of
Canadian airmass settles over the region.

&&

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...
High pressure moves overhead Tuesday night into Wednesday morning,
then gradually pushes offshore Wednesday night into Thursday. Skies
are expected to be clear to mostly clear during this time frame. The
high remains offshore Friday leading to a return flow from the
south, which means increasing temperatures and dewpoints late next
week and an increase in cloud cover.

Conditions look to become unsettled next weekend as a frontal system
approaches from the west. At the same time, low pressure develops
along an old frontal boundary to the south, which also may approach
the area. Guidance still varies in timing and placement of these
systems. The 12Z GFS and GDPS bring the coastal low over the area
while the 12Z ICON keeps it far out to sea. The 12Z ECMWF develops
two coastal lows, kicking one out to sea, then another up the east
coast. Ensembles also vary, with some bringing a coastal low up the
coast into our area while others keep it far out to sea. Until this
event comes more into focus, exact impacts will be hard to pinpoint.

Highs during the long term will be in the 70s. Lows Tuesday night
into Wednesday morning will dip into the upper-40s in the interior
and into the 50s almost everywhere else. Thereafter, overnight lows
are expected to warm to the 50s and 60s by the weekend due to
increased cloud cover, warm advection, and a more humid air mass in
place.

.AVIATION /22Z SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
A pre-frontal trough exits east this afternoon, followed by a cold
front passage around midnight tonight. High pressure builds in
thereafter.

VFR, except a couple more hours of sub-VFR to start with at KGON and
possibly KISP as well. Still a chance of showers over the next hour
or two, but only east of the city terminals. Iso tstm possible at
KISP before around 21z. SW winds around 10 kt will shift more
westerly towards midnight, then shifting NW-NNW around midnight
behind the cold front. Gusts 16-20kt for Monday, mainly in the
afternoon.

    ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...
