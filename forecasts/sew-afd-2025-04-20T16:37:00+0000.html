Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
937 AM PDT Sun Apr 20 2025

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Radar imagery showing shower activity across Western
Washington this morning along the coast and North/Central Puget
Sound. Expect showers to increase in coverage this afternoon as a
trough pushes across the region. Models are still in good
agreement with a convergence zone developing in the afternoon to
evening hours along the Central Sound and Cascades. Precipitation
amounts will be light, with localized higher amounts within the
convergence zone. Otherwise, the inherited forecast remains on
track. Please refer to an updated aviation discussion below.

.SYNOPSIS...A trough will bring widespread rain to Western
Washington Sunday. Post trough convergence zone may lead to
additional inches of snow along the passes Sunday evening.
Conditions will begin to dry out on Monday. High pressure will
bring dry and warmer conditions through midweek. Precipitation
chances return late in the week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Onshore flow will persist
today and showers will increase with a passing trough axis. Most
of the showers will be along the coast and mountains, with the
focus shifting to the central sound and Cascades this
afternoon and evening as a Puget Sound Convergence Zone develops.
Snow levels will start around 4000 ft and will lower to around
2500 ft overnight with a few inches of snow expected at both
Stevens and Snoqualmie Pass.

Monday will be drier (for the lowlands) but also cooler under NW
flow. Forecast highs are in the 50s with lows Monday night in the
30s to lower 40s. Areas around the south sound may see freezing
temps with lows in the lower 30s possible.

Dry N/NW flow continues into Tuesday with a ridge centered
offshore. Expect mostly sunny conditions with highs in the
interior around 60. The coast will be cooler and in the 50s with
onshore winds. 33

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...High pressure brings dry
and slightly warmer weather moving forward through Wednesday and
Thursday. Highs on Thursday will peak in the lower 70s in the
interior, with 60s at the coast. The ridge axis shifts east
Thursday night and Friday while a trough digs offshore. This
trough will tap into moisture for a chance of showers and cooler
conditions overall. An upper level low will spin overhead on
Saturday for additional showers and ongoing cooler conditions. 33

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow will persist aloft through the TAF
period as an upper level trough swings through western WA today.
Radar showing increasing shower activity across the region this
morning (mainly north of I-90 and along the coast), and expect
activity to expand throughout the day. A convergence zone looks to
develop across the central Sound later this afternoon and persist
into Monday, which may cause sporadic shifts in winds to the north
and east between 23Z-05Z for the interior terminals. Ceilings are
primarily MVFR across the region this morning and will remain a
mix between MVFR/VFR through the morning hours. VFR conditions
look to increase after 21Z and persist into Monday morning. Most
terminals will see southwest winds at 5 to 10 kt this morning,
turning more westerly late Sunday (outside of the convergence
zone activity). Gusts to 20-25 kt will be possible for KCLM along
the Strait of Juan de Fuca as onshore flow increases again this
evening.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings with showers in the vicinity of the terminal.
Winds generally persisting at 5-10 kt out of the south this morning.
VFR conditions expected to resume this afternoon, however a convergence
zone looks to develop close to or over the terminal between 22Z-09Z
Monday. Wind shifts to the north/east are expected within the
convergence activity, before winds return back to the south by
roughly 07-09Z. Couple higher gusts to 20 kt cannot be ruled out.
Expect ceilings to briefly return to MVFR Monday morning.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak trough will pass through the waters this afternoon
into Monday. As high pressure builds offshore, a decent push of
onshore flow is expected late Sunday into Monday with northwesterlies
pushing through the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and the northwestern
portions of the coastal waters. Winds will peak in these areas of
up to 20 to 25 kt, and a couple spots may see gusts approach 30
kt. Post-trough, there are no wind/weather concerns at this time
for the remainder of the week.

Seas in the coastal waters will steepen to 8-10 feet at roughly 10
seconds (the steepest seas will be in the northern half of the
coastal zones today with 9 second periods). Expect a drop down to 5
to 7 feet Monday through the rest of the week.
