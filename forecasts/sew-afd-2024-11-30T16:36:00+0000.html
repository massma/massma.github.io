Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
836 AM PST Sat Nov 30 2024

.SYNOPSIS...High pressure will continue to amplify into western
Washington over the weekend and into early next week, allowing
for mostly dry conditions and widespread night and morning fog.
The high pressure ridge will begin to weaken towards the middle of
next week, introducing the next chance for widespread
precipitation across the region.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Isolated showers up north
this morning with weak/light warm frontal precip near the border.
Elsewhere, dry with a mix of mid level clouds and patchy low
clouds. Highs in the mid 40s this afternoon. 33

Previous discussion...Surface observations early this morning
show areas of patchy fog mainly over areas southwest of the Puget
Sound, though increasing cloud cover has done enough to inhibit
widespread fog development. Conditions will improve throughout the
morning with continued light shower and virga activity into the
afternoon, mainly along the Canadian border. Forecast models
continue to show good agreement over a drying trend through the
short-term under high pressure aloft. This will likely allow for
patchy low clouds and fog each morning with partly cloudy skies
each afternoon. Highs are on track to peak in the upper 40s to
lower 50s each day across the lowlands with lows bottoming out
near or just above the freezing mark through Monday.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...High pressure will remain
firmly in place over western Washington mid-week, allowing for
continued dry conditions with periods of morning fog and low
stratus. The ridge will start to break down towards the end of
next week, with ensembles bringing in the next chance for
widespread precipitation on Thursday and Friday. This incoming
system will bring in warmer temperatures peaking in the mid to
upper 50s for most areas with a more active weather pattern
favored to return by next weekend. Preliminary precipitation
totals are light with the bulk of the incoming moisture focused
over the Olympic Peninsula.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West to northwest flow aloft will continue over
Western Washington today as the region remains on the periphery of
an upper level ridge. Varying degrees of mid and high clouds will
continue to stream across the area this morning. Low level moisture
in the form of low MVFR stratus remains trapped across the interior
lowlands from near KBFI southward. This will likely remain in place
through midday before scattering out to VFR ceilings by around 20Z.
Mid and high level moisture is expected to decrease tonight leading
to greater coverage of IFR/LIFR fog and low clouds on Sunday
morning. Winds will remain light and variable throughout the day
today.

KSEA...MVFR stratus moved out of the terminal earlier this morning -
so VFR under mid/high clouds will continue through the afternoon.
Less high level moisture tonight will be favorable for the formation
of IFR/LIFR in fog or low stratus on Sunday morning. Surface winds
light S/SE shifting to light N/NE late this afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure at the surface and aloft will remain over
the waters into early next week for rather tranquil conditions. A
weakening front will reach the area around midweek before a somewhat
stronger system follows on Thursday. Waves will increase from 4 to 6
feet up to 6 to 8 feet this weekend into Monday, then will drop back
to 4 to 6 feet till the end of the week with another rise back up to
6 to 8 feet Thursday.
