Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
742 AM EDT Thu Jun 27 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure slowly builds across the region late today and
into Friday. A warm front lifts north Saturday followed by a
cold front on Sunday. High pressure returns for the a start of
next week.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
Scattered showers come to an end as a cold front works its way
across the area. Made some minor updates to current conditions
to better reflect latest observation trends.

Dry weather is expected today, but could still see some
lingering cloud cover until mid/late afternoon today. High
pressure then builds slowly east across the northeast.

Highs will be in the low to upper 80s today with tonight lows
dropping into the mid 50s to mid 60s under clear skies with
northerly flow around 5-10 mph.

&&

.SHORT TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT/...
High pressure remains over the region through much of Friday, before
starting to shift east into the New England coast late Friday into
Friday night. This will result in abundant sunshine with
temperatures in the upper 70s to near 80 and dewpoints in the 40s.
Temperatures Friday night will be in the 50s to low 60s.

&&

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
High pressure will pass off the New England Coast Friday night,
allowing a warm front to lift through on Saturday. An unsettled
but very warm period will set up for Saturday night and Sunday
as a prefrontal trough and cold front move through, bringing
shower/tstms. The heat index may approach or surpass 95, mainly
in NE NJ and perhaps also in NYC and along the north shore of
Long Island, with temps approaching 90 and dewpoints in the
lower 70s, but it is possible that limited daytime heating and
better vertical mixing could lead to cooler temps and/or lower
dewpoints so this remains uncertain, and at any rate would last
for only one day.

With the exception of Sunday, and possibly next Wednesday ahead
of another cold front when temps will again be on the rise,
temps should be close to normal.

&&
