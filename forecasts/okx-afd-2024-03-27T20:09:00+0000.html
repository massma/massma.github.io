Area Forecast Discussion...CORRECTED
National Weather Service New York NY
409 PM EDT Wed Mar 27 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front will continue to approach from the west for tonight.
This front will weaken and eventually move across Thursday. The
front and a developing area of low pressure to the southeast of
this front will move east of the region Thursday night. The low
then moves northward into the Canadian Maritimes Friday. A
clipper type system passes to the south and east late Saturday and
Saturday night. High pressure briefly returns Sunday before
another low pressure system impacts the region Monday through
Wednesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM THURSDAY MORNING/...
A cold front continues to approach from the west.

Doppler radar indicates more areas of light rain moving across
the Lower Hudson Valley and Northeast NJ. Chances for rain
increase elsewhere going into early this evening.

Upper level jet streak SW to NE continues to approach from the
west tonight. From forecast models, it appears that the local
region gets closer to the right rear quadrant of this jet streak
late tonight into early Thursday morning. There will be
increasing divergence aloft, with vertical lift increasing
tonight. Rain will overspread the region from west to east,
intensifying overnight into early Thursday morning. Rain looks
to be stratiform rain mostly.

At the surface, the cold front continues to approach tonight while
simultaneously weakening. Layer precipitable water reaches near
1 to 1.2 inches, above climatology.

Low temperatures are a blend of consensus of raw model data and
the NBM 50th percentile, staying in the low to mid 40s.

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM THURSDAY MORNING THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/...
Aloft on Thursday, the upper level jet streak will continue to
be maximized north and west of the region, thereby with the
local region remaining near the right rear quad. On a larger
scale, the upper level trough becomes more negatively tilted.
Meanwhile at the surface, the cold front will continue to weaken
and move across the region during the day.

The front may very dissipate during the afternoon. During the
afternoon, low pressure in the Atlantic will be moving northeast and
will become more of a factor in terms of the local weather. The
forecast has more northerly flow across the entire area Thursday
afternoon, but not that gusty until towards the evening.

High temperatures Thursday are a blend of consensus of raw model
data and the NBM, only getting into the upper 40s to lower 50s.

Rain will continue through the day especially along the coast
where divergence aloft appears greater in the models. The
divergence is less across the interior areas and with drier air
moving in, chances for rain will lower during the afternoon
across these interior locations, mainly across interior
Northeast NJ and the Lower Hudson Valley.

For Thursday night, rain holds on across the coastal areas,
especially Eastern Long Island and Southeast CT. Colder and
drier air will advect in from the north. May even have some
chances of snow mixing in across parts of the region before all
precipitation comes to an end. Winds will become gusty from the
north as low pressure deepens out in the Atlantic getting east
of the 40N/70W benchmark and high pressure building in from
South Central Canada. Gusts up to near 30 mph are forecast and
higher gusts are possible, perhaps up to near 40 mph. Forecast
lows are mainly in the mid to upper 30s.

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
No significant changes in the long term period, as precipitation
will be ending across the eastern portion of the forecast area
Friday morning. With near zonal flow a clipper type system is
expected to quickly approach Saturday afternoon and pass to the east
and south Saturday night, as the associated upper trough phases with
the low over the Canadian Maritimes. Zonal flow become reestablished
Sunday night and yet another upper trough and surface frontal system
will be quickly approaching for Monday. Initially, a warm front will
move toward the area Monday, and then the associated low will move
slowly eastward into the region Tuesday and Wednesday. With near
seasonal temperatures through much of the extended period, except
slightly above for Saturday and Sunday, all liquid precipitation is
expected. And NBM temperatures looked reasonable through the
extended and were used.

&&

.AVIATION /20Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
A cold front slowly approaches tonight from the west. A wave of low
pressure then approaches from the south into Thursday.

VFR conditions have become more widespread for the terminals
early this afternoon. Showers continue to develop to the west
which will move into the area into this evening. MVFR cigs will move
in with these showers into this evening. Cigs likely continue to
lower to IFR for most terminals by 4Z with rain becoming more
widespread. LIFR conditions will be possible for all terminals
overnight, though coastal and outlying terminals (KISP, KGON, KBDR,
KHPN) may have a higher chance of seeing LIFR cigs overnight and
into Thursday morning. IFR conditions likely continue much of the
day Thursday with rain continuing. Slight improvements to MVFR
are possible Thursday afternoon for the NYC terminals.

Winds will be fairly light at around 5 kt out of the N/NE
through the overnight and into the Thursday morning push. Winds
then shift to the NW and increase to 10-15kt Thursday late
morning into the afternoon.

     NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Timing of category changes may be off by several hours. LIFR
cigs possible overnight but timing and coverage uncertain.

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY...

Thursday afternoon: IFR with rain, eventually tapering off late
at night except at KGON. Improvement to MVFR late afternoon into
the overnight. NW wind gusts Thursday night to near 20 kt.

Friday: MVFR early, becoming VFR in the afternoon. Slight chance
of rain early for KISP and KGON. NW wind gusts 20-25 kt.

Saturday: Mainly VFR during the day. Chance of showers and MVFR
at night, possibly mixed with snow for KSWF. W-NW wind gusts
20-25 kt day. Gusts diminish at night.

Sunday: Mainly VFR. NW wind gusts 15-20 kt afternoon into evening.

Monday: MVFR possible with a chance of showers.

.MARINE...
SCA for ocean seas continues, although it is becoming more
marginal for seas for western ocean, Sandy Hook to Fire Island
offshore waters. To the east, SCA for ocean seas extended through
the day Thursday due to higher seas near 5 ft. For Thursday night,
pressure gradient tightens with SCA wind gusts expected for all
waters and even the potential for gales across the ocean. Gale
watch for the ocean has been hoisted for Thursday night with SCA
for non-ocean waters.

Small craft advisory gusts will be ongoing across the forecast
waters Friday as deepening low pressure tracks northward into the
Canadian Maritimes. There is a chance that gusts could approach gale
force on the eastern ocean waters late Friday as the low deepens.
SCA gusts will continues into Friday night on all the waters except
for New York Harbor as conditions will be gradually improving from
the west and south during Saturday into Saturday evening as the low
tracks farther to the north through eastern Canada and weakens, as a
clipper type system approaches Saturday night. A light flow is
expected Sunday through Monday as high pressure moves through the
forecast waters and conditions remain below advisory levels across
the forecast waters.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
Around 1 to 1.5 inches of rain expected tonight through Thursday
night. With mostly a steady stratiform rainfall, not expecting
any significant flooding from this. Any locally heavier rainfall
could produce some minor nuisance flooding in poor drainage areas
but that is it.

Otherwise, no hydrologic impacts are anticipated into the
middle of next week.
