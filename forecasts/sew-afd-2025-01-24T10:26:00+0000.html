National Weather Service Seattle WA
226 AM PST Fri Jan 24 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak system moving south of the area early this
morning. Upper level ridge building offshore with dry
northeasterly flow aloft beginning later today. Offshore upper
level ridge building into Northern British Columbia over the
weekend with the ridge moving directly over Western Washington
Monday and Tuesday. Ridge shifting east Wednesday with first

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows weak
shortwave over the central portion of Western Washington moving
south. Cloudy skies over most of the area with some clearing
already over Whatcom county. Doppler radar has shower activity
over the Central Puget Sound dissipating at 2 am/10z. With the
cloud cover temperatures much warmer than previous mornings with
mid 30s to lower 40s. The exception to this is Whatcom county
where the clearing skies have allowed temperatures to drop once
again into the 20s.

Shortwave moving south of the area this morning. Dry
northeasterly flow aloft developing with an upper level ridge
building offshore. Skies clearing from the north this morning
with mostly clear skies by mid afternoon. Highs in the lower to
mid 40s.

Upper level ridge offshore nosing into British Columbia over the
weekend with dry northeasterly flow aloft. In the lower levels
light offshore flow developing tonight and continuing through
the weekend. Patchy freezing fog in the usual places like the
Southwest Interior in the early morning hours both Saturday and
Sunday. Fog that does form will be shallow and dissipate by mid
morning. Otherwise more of the same with sunny days and clear
nights. Highs in the mid 40s. Lows tonight into the 20s and lower
30s. Lows Saturday night a couple of degrees cooler. Could need a
cold weather advisory for some locations for Saturday night/early
Sunday morning in future forecast packages.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement again this morning. Upper level ridge moving directly
over Western Washington Monday with the ridge remaining in place
Tuesday. Two more days of what we have seen the most of the
second half of January, patchy morning freezing fog otherwise
sunny days and clear nights. Highs in the lower to mid 40s. Lows
in the 20s and lower 30s.

Changes in the pattern beginning Wednesday with the upper level
ridge moving off to the east. One more sunny day with patchy
morning freezing fog. Highs in the lower to mid 40s and lows in
the 20s to lower 30s.

Organized front approaching Wednesday night with the front moving
through the area Thursday. Good chance this feature gives Western
Washington the most rain we have seen since January 4th. Snow
levels 2500 to 3000 feet with the mountains getting a few inches
of new snow. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest flow aloft will switch to northeast today as a
shortwave trough sinks to the south and a ridge builds back in to
the north. MVFR cigs prevail across most of western Washington
following a frontal passage late last night. Some light scattered
showers are evident on radar early this morning but overall little
to no impact is expected as temperatures remain above freezing. This
added low-level moisture will help keep ceilings MVFR this morning,
with some locations experiencing isolated visibility restrictions in
mist/fog. Light north to northeast winds will pick up a bit to
around 8 to 12 kt this afternoon.

Gradual improvement is expected through around 15-18Z as ceilings
begin to lift to VFR and scatter out. Clear skies are expected by
late this afternoon and continue tonight.

KSEA...MVFR cigs remain behind a frontal passage early this morning.
A few light showers in the vicinity but temperatures remain above
freezing and little to no impacts are expected. Gradual lifting of
the ceiling is expected this morning to low-end VFR before clouds
dissipate late this morning into this afternoon. Clear skies prevail
into tonight. Winds north to northeast will increase this afternoon
to around 10 to 15 kt before easing up tonight.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak frontal system pushed south of area this morning,
with breezy northerly winds persisting throughout the day today.
The strongest winds remain across the outer coastal waters, where a
Small Craft Advisory remains in effect through this afternoon. Winds
will pick up a bit through the interior waters through the East
Strait of Juan de Fuca and Puget Sound later this morning and into
this afternoon, but remain well below criteria. High pressure re-
develops over interior British Columbia and over the offshore
Pacific, with a surface trough along the coastline. This setup will
allow for light northeasterly winds to continue through this weekend
and into the beginning of next week. High pressure will begin to
weaken and broaden out mid-week as the next frontal system
approaches the area. This system may arrive as early as Wednesday
night, but will more likely arrive sometime Thursday.

Seas will peak early this morning around 7 to 11 ft, with the
highest waves over the outermost coastal waters, and will ease
today. Seas will subside to around 4 to 6 ft this weekend and
through next week, until the next system arrives late week.
