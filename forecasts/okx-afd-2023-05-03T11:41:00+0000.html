Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
741 AM EDT Wed May 3 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
Low pressure remains over the region before shifting offshore
late tonight into Thursday morning. A surface trough may linger
nearby on Thursday before high pressure starts to build in
Thursday night into Friday. The high pressure will then be
in control into the beginning of next week

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
Forecast on track. Anomalous closed upper low with 500 mb
heights 2-3 standard deviations below normal will continue to
spin over the northeast today. The center of the upper low
begins to move towards the coast this afternoon and evening. A
broad surface low pressure will linger over the area into this
evening.

Scattered showers are expected to develop late this morning into
the afternoon as the center of the upper low/associated energy
aloft move in from the west. The greatest coverage based on a
consensus of the latest high resolution data will be from around
the NYC metro/Hudson River corridor west into northeast New
Jersey and the Lower Hudson Valley. Shower coverage appears less
further east across Long Island and southeastern Connecticut
due to weaker lift and less middle level moisture.

Steep low level lapse rates along with the cold pocket aloft may
yield a few hundred J/Kg of SBCAPE, mainly north and west of the
NYC metro. Isolated thunderstorms are possible which may
contain small hail. Rainfall amounts will be light overall
although some isolated spots could see a few tenths in a heavier
downpour.

Highs will only reach the middle and upper 50s, several degrees
below normal for this time of year.

The upper low and associated surface low move offshore tonight.
Showers are possible, especially along and near an inverted trough
that may set up NW of the offshore low. Overall coverage should be
isolated to scattered, especially overnight. Lows will be in the
lower to middle 40s.

&&

.SHORT TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
The low pressure system continues moving further offshore on
Thursday. However, cyclonic flow will remain aloft. Several
pieces of energy are likely to rotate around the upper low. A
surface trough should also be nearby. These features will
combine to keep mostly cloudy conditions in place with scattered
showers developing in the afternoon. Lapse rates are not as
steep and little to no CAPE is present in forecast soundings.
Highs will continue below normal in the middle to upper 50s.

Any lingering showers in the evening quickly diminish with loss
of daytime heating. Otherwise, high pressure begins to build in
from the north and west Thursday night. Mostly cloudy conditions
persist with lows in the 40s. High pressure continues building
in on Friday. The region will still lie on the outer periphery
of the upper low, which should be over the North Atlantic. There
will likely be enough middle level moisture to support mostly
cloudy skies. A shower is also possible in the afternoon as some
energy may persist on the backside of the offshore low. Highs
begin to moderate, but still should be below normal in the upper
50s to lower 60s.

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
The area remains positioned between a departing midlevel trough
to the east and an amplifying midlevel ridge to the west by the
weekend. This pattern remains fairly steady with weak
disturbances embedded in the flow passing by through the long
term before the mid- level flow become more zonal by Tuesday to
Wednesday of next week.

At the surface, a weak surface high pressure builds into the
area over the weekend and persists through at least Monday.
This will result in fairly dry conditions with mostly clear to
partly cloudy skies during this timeframe. Temperatures will be
on a gradual warming trend with highs on Saturday in the mid-60s
gradually warming up to the mid 70s by Tuesday.

Pieces of energy continue to rotate around the backside of the
large wave trough to the east by the middle of next week which
may try to merge with other weak disturbances approaching the
area from the west. This may result in some weak low pressure
system impacting the area by late Tuesday or Wednesday of next
week.

.AVIATION /12Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Broad area of low pressure remains over the area through the TAF
period.

Mainly VFR expected through today with pockets of MVFR ceilings
possible and scattered showers through the day. Shower activity
is expected to increase after 15Z with the most numerous
showers over the westernmost and NYC terminals. Showers should
begin to diminish into the evening but may linger through 2-3Z .
More widespread MVFR ceilings develop overnight into Thursday
morning.

WSW to SW winds at around 10 kt today. Winds veer to the NW and
N tonight and into the morning on Thursday at less than 10 kt.

     NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Amendments may be needed today with shower activity and pockets
of MVFR ceilings possible at times. Uncertainty remains as to
the extent of shower coverage throughout the day.

OUTLOOK FOR 12Z THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...

Thursday: Mainly VFR. Chance of showers with MVFR conditions at
times.

Friday: VFR. Chance of showers during the day. Light winds.

Saturday and Sunday: VFR. W/NW flow under 10 kt.

.MARINE...
Elevated seas around 5 ft linger east of Moriches Inlet through
the middle of the morning. Otherwise, conditions on the waters
will be sub-SCA through tonight. Winds on the eastern waters may
increase Thursday and could reach around 20 kt in the
afternoon. Seas may also build close to 5 ft east or Moriches
Inlet from an offshore low pressure late Thursday into Thursday
night. Any elevated seas quickly subside Friday morning with
sub-SCA conditions elsewhere.

Sub-SCA conditions are expected on all waters Friday night through
the weekend.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
Residual minor flooding along the Passaic River at Little Falls
is forecast to continue into this afternoon before falling below
flood stage. Otherwise, no additional hydrologic impacts are
expected through early next week.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
Astronomical tides are increasing into the end of the week with
the approach of a full moon on Friday. The most vulnerable
locations along the south shore back bays, lower NY Harbor, and
Western Long Island Sound could see minor flooding benchmarks
touched with Thursday evenings high tide.

&&

.OKX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CT...None.
NY...None.
NJ...None.
MARINE...Small Craft Advisory until 11 AM EDT this morning for ANZ350.
