Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Flat upper level ridge over Western Washington through
the weekend with low level onshore flow. Weak upper level trough
Monday could enhance the onshore flow. Upper level ridge rebuilding
Tuesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Main message this morning is
cooler weather is on the way but for the interior temperatures
will remain above normal through the period.

Satellite imagery shows stratus along the coast, moving down the
Strait of Juan De Fuca and moving through the Lower Chehalis
Valley, Clear skies over the remainder of the area. Cooler marine
air hasn`t arrived east of Puget Sound with temperatures at 3
am/10z still in the 60s and lower 70s. West of the Sound
temperatures are mostly in the mid to upper 50s.

Upper level ridge that gave the area the hot weather now well east
of the area. Thermally induced surface trough also east of the
Cascades early this morning. Low level onshore flow in place with
KUIL-KBLI gradient near plus 3 mb and KHQM-KSEA gradient near plus
2 mb. Not a strong marine push but this combined with the cooling
temperatures aloft, 850 mb lowering from plus 20C-22C yesterday to
plus 16C-18C this afternoon, and the continuation of onshore flow
during the day today will result in cooler high temperatures
across the area. The most cooling will be along the coast with
highs around 15 degrees cooler today versus Tuesday readings, in
the mid 60s to lower 70s. For the interior about 10 degrees of
cooling with a little less in the Cascade foothills because the
marine push is shallow. Highs for the interior today mostly in
the upper 70s to upper 80s. Warmest locations, like the Cascade
foothills, still getting into the lower 90s.

Little change in the pattern tonight through Friday with the flat
upper level ridge over the area and varying degrees of low level
onshore flow. 500 mb heights remaining in the mid 580 dms. 850 mb
temperatures also remaining fairly consistent in the plus 16C-18C
range. The increased difference in the high temperatures between
the coast and the interior this afternoon will increase the low
level onshore flow tonight. This will bring more marine air into
the interior Thursday for another 5 degrees or so of cooling on
the high temperatures. Highs both Thursday and Friday for the
interior in the mid 70s to mid 80s. With more marine air getting
into the interior both nights lows in the 50s.

A heat advisory is still in place for portions of the interior
until 5 pm this afternoon. With lows dropping into the 50s the
next couple of mornings this will lessen the HeatRisk across the
area.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Models in good agreement
with little change in the pattern for most of the extended period.
Flat upper level ridge remaining over the area through the
weekend with 500 mb heights remaining in the mid 580 dms. In the
lower levels varying degrees of onshore flow through Sunday. Some
of the ensemble solutions have a very weak trough moving through
Monday. The only thing this feature will do, if it comes about,
will be to enhance the marine layer a little Monday morning.
Ensembles in good agreement that the flat ridge will rebound
Tuesday. Highs temperatures for the interior in the mid 70s to
mid 80s. Along the coast highs in the 60s and lower 70s. Lows
mostly in the 50s each morning. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper ridge axis well east of the area with southwest
flow aloft. VFR in place for most TAF sites with the exception of
KHQM where IFR conditions are currently observed under marine
stratus. This will maintain before ceilings gradually mix out
towards the mid-late afternoon but returning by the evening hours. A
20-30% chance of MVFR to IFR cigs are possible at KCLM also this
morning but should burn off in the afternoon as well if manifests.
Marine stratus looks to return overnight Wednesday becoming more
widespread.


KSEA...VFR through the upcoming TAF period. Light SW surface winds
this morning between 2 to 5 kt becoming N-NW in the mid-afternoon
between 5 to 10 kt. Winds then become lighter in magnitude
overnight.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>1024mb surface ridge over the NE Pacific will strengthen
just off the coastal waters through the week. A thermal trough is
shifting east of the Cascades, resulting in increased onshore flow.
Fog caused by shallow marine stratus is likely for the coastal
waters becoming less widespread as the morning progress. A SCA over
the strait will be allowed to expire this morning but, it`ll be
replaced by a gale warning later this afternoon into the night hours
where an 80-90% chance gale gusts will be reached during this time.
Stubborn onshore flow looks to remain into the weekend with
diurnally driven westerly pushes through the strait possibly
accompanied with headlines.

Seas generally 4 to 6 ft today before increasing to 6 to 8 ft
Thursday and nearing 10 ft by Friday for the outer coastal waters.

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The red flag warning for the Cascades ended late
last night. Increasing low level onshore flow will help with
humidity recoveries in the early morning hours and keep late
afternoon relative humidity values from dropping as low as they
have the last few days. Even though the current weather conditions
do not meet red flag criteria, this last week of hot dry weather
dried out the area significantly and the fire danger across
Western Washington is much higher than it was at the start of the
month. Lets stay careful out there! Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
