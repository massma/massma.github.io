Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
227 AM PDT Fri Apr 18 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper ridge will maintain dry, warm conditions
today. A weak frontal system will bring showers Friday night
through Saturday. Upper troughing will be over the Pacific
Northwest Sunday into Monday for continued unsettled weather.
Weak troughing on Tuesday with ridging Wednesday into Thursday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Generally clear skies early
this morning across Western Washington with a few high clouds.
Another dry, warm day for the area with the upper ridge axis over
Pacific Northwest. Temperatures will peak this afternoon in the
mid 60s to lower 70s. Clouds increase later this afternoon into
this evening as onshore flow increases ahead of a weak front.
Showers will initially move eastward across the Olympic Peninsula
early tonight, before moving into the interior and Cascades
Saturday morning. Onshore flow will then promote the development
of weak convergence across central Puget Sound for a few showers
lingering into Saturday afternoon. Temperatures will be cooler on
Saturday, with highs in the mid 50s to low 60s.

Troughing will then slide southwards from British Columbia into
the Pacific Northwest on Sunday, allowing for another uptick in
precipitation potential for Western Washington on Sunday. Another
convergence zone will likely develop around King and Snohomish
Counties Sunday evening into Sunday night for additional
precipitation. Snow levels by Sunday night will fall to near 2500
to 3000 feet, resulting in a few inches of snowfall in the
central Cascades, including the Passes. Temperatures will continue
to be cooler on Sunday, with highs in the 50s.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...The upper trough will
slowly slide eastwards on Monday, with lingering precipitation
tapering off by later Monday. Weak troughing is expected to
develop over Western Washington on Tuesday, although not much in
the way of precipitation is expected on Tuesday. Ensembles are in
general agreement that weak ridging will build Wednesday into
Thursday for drier weather. Overnight temperatures both Tuesday
and Wednesday morning will be on the cooler side, from the mid 30s
to low 40s, and will have to monitor any frost potential. High
temperatures will slowly moderate through midweek as ridging
builds into the area. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northerly flow aloft as an upper level ridge along the
coast shifts eastward. As the ridge axis passes through, flow will
shift to more zonal this evening before shifting northwesterly as a
shortwave trough quickly passes through overnight. The air mass
remains dry and stable. Most terminals seeing light and variable
winds this morning before shifting to more southwesterly around 15Z
and increasing in speed to 5-10 kts. Notable exception being CLM
where westerly flow down the Strait is resulting in speeds 5-10 kts
at the time of this writing. While direction will remain unchanged
through the TAF period, speeds will increase to 10-15 kts with gusts
up to 25 possible by late afternoon /after 00Z/.

Widespread VFR conditions in place and will remain that way for most
terminals for the entire TAF period. The exception will be along the
coast, as models continue to indicate low stratus development there
and as such is expected to impact HQM...dragging cigs down into MVFR
before recovering back to VFR by 18Z. As the aforementioned upper
trough approaches, high clouds will increase over W WA with cigs
developing and lowering to around 3000-5000 ft near the end of the
TAF period. Still VFR, but considerably lower than at the start of
the forecast.

KSEA...VFR conditions with some high cirrus. Light and variable
winds with speeds 5 kts or less this morning will switch to
southwest around 15Z, with speeds increasing to 6 to 10 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface ridging will remain over the waters today before
a weak front slips southward along the British Columbia coast and
into area waters tonight into Saturday. Increasing northwesterlies
over the coastal waters and strengthening onshore flow will bring
solid small craft conditions to many area waters. Inherited headline
looks good and will remain unaltered with the morning forecast
package.

Seas 5 to 7 ft today building to above 10 feet late tonight into
Saturday. In addition, steep seas possible with periods under 10
seconds over the coastal waters into Saturday. A secondary system
will produce a similar result later Sunday into early Monday. High
pressure will then rebuild across the waters early next week.
