Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
558 PM EDT Sat Oct 21 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Deep low pressure over the Atlantic will track into the Canadian
Maritimes tonight, and linger there through Sunday. High
pressure will build in on Monday and remain through the week.
Meanwhile, a warm front will pass to the north Tuesday night,
possibly followed by another Thursday night. A weakening cold
front should approach from the west by Saturday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SUNDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Deep low pressure east of Cape Cod early this evening will
continue to track away from the region tngt. Winds will
increase thru this eve as the pres gradient increases. The
biggest drop in winds overnight will be across the interior,
with Long Island to see the smallest drops due to the
relatively warm water surrounding the island. The modeling keeps
peak gusts in the 30-40 mph range, and based on the position of
the low, this seems reasonable. Wind advy was therefore
not issued.

Isolated showers across ern CT and the forks of Long Island
will continue to taper off early this evening. Removed
sprinkles from the fcst farther west as radars show any precip
confined to the higher elevations NW of the fcst area.

CAA tngt with temps dropping into the 40s. Too much wind and
clouds to let temps bottom out, so the NBM was followed with
minor adjustments.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT/...
A strong piece of h5 energy rotates thru on Sun. H85 temps per the
GFS drop to -2 to -3 or so. Low to mid 50s per the NBM seem
reasonable in this scenario so it was accepted for the fcst. NBM
pops suggest only the nwrn interior in line for shwrs, but based on
the setup, this may be underdone. Will stick with the NBM for now,
but if the model trends hold and the upr sys does come thru in the
aftn, would expect pops needed for isold-sct activity.

It will otherwise be windy on Sun as high pres builds into the
Midwest, keeping a tight pres gradient in place.

It remains breezy Sun ngt, especially the first half of the ngt,
which will me a limiting factor for temps. Some areas will likely
still drop into the upr 30s despite this, per the NBM which was
followed. The possibility exists that there is a decoupling right
before sunrise allowing temps to drop blw fcst values, particularly
in the interior.

&&

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
Tranquil weather expected as high pressure remains in control. HIgh
temps on Mon look close to normal and should be followed by one
rather cool night Mon night under mostly clear skies/light winds
with the sfc high parked overhead. Areas of frost are likely mainly
inland where lows should bottom out in the mid/upper 30s, with 40s
fcst for much of the immediate coast and the metro area.

Models show a warm front passing to the north Tue night, and indeed
temps during mid to late week will be on the mild side per MOS
guidance and the NBM 75th percentile, with highs at least in in the
lower/mid 70s Wed/Thu, if not approaching the upper 70s in some
urban/valley spots N/W of NYC per latest ECMWF MOS. Less certainty
on how warm it will be on Fri/Sat due to proximity of a frontal
boundary especially on Sat, with highs in the upper 60s/lower 70s
fcst for now, but Fri has potential to be at least as warm as
Wed/Thu if the nearby front remains far enough north.

PoP during the period no higher than slight chance with the
approaching front late in the week.

.AVIATION /22Z SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An area of low pressure rapidly deepens just east of the area
this evening as it tracks towards the Gulf of Maine into
tomorrow. High pressure builds in tonight from the west.

Conditions have become MVFR to VFR across the city terminals.
VFR is expected to hold for tonight and tomorrow.

Showers have now cleared all terminals with tonight expected to
remain rain-free.

W to NW winds have increased 20 to 25 kt with
gusts at or around 30kt holding through this evening. Gusts diminish
somewhat tonight, but will still be in the 20 to 25 kt range.
Gusts remain the same tomorrow.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Timing of any remaining category changes could still be off by
an hour or two.

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...

Sunday: Mainly VFR. W to NW wind gusts around 25-30 kt.

Monday: VFR. Gusty NW flow 15-20 kt in the morning.

Tuesday: VFR.

Wednesday: VFR.

Thursday: VFR.

forecasts, can be found at: https:/www.weather.gov/zny/n90<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Gale warning remains in effect for all waters through tonight
for gusts 35-40 kt. Wind gusts are likely to fall blw gale force
on Sun, resulting in the need for an SCA on all waters into
Sunday evening. SCA cond should continue on the ocean waters
late Sunday night with gusts up to 30 kt and seas 5-7 ft,
gradually falling below 25 kt and 5 ft respectively by midday
Sunday.

The longer term looks mainly quiet as high pressure dominates.
SW flow after a warm frontal passage to the north could push
ocean seas up to 4 ft Wed afternoon/night.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
