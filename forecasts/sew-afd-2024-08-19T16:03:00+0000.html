Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
903 AM PDT Mon Aug 19 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A series of upper level lows and troughs will dominate
the pattern this week over Western Washington. Some clearing will
take place early Monday morning that may lead to patchy fog,
especially in the Southwest Interior. Active showers with
embedded thunderstorms will continue this morning over the coastal
waters, and weaken to just showers inland today west of
Interstate 5. After Monday, showers and isolated thunderstorms
will be possible Tuesday through Saturday, as the cool and wet
pattern continues into the weekend.

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mostly clear skies dominate across the interior lowlands
this morning with cloudy skies and precipitation over the Olympic
Peninsula westward to the coastal waters. Thunder chances will
remain mostly off the Pacific Coast today, but a strike or two
cannot be entirely ruled out along the north coast. The current
forecast is in good shape and no updates are planned.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...A mid and upper level low
over Northwest Washington just off of Neah Bay will begin to fill
(weaken) today as it begins to move onshore today into Tuesday.
The associated jet max has moved out of the area, though a
vorticity max remains in the center of the low. A surface trough
has been a focus point for overnight showers with embedded
thunderstorms off the coastal waters. The surface trough will spin
the precipitation/moisture around the low, and move inland late
this morning into the evening. The precipitation chances today
again will remain primarily west of I-5. Instability over land is
anemic today (compared to over the weekend), so the thunder
threat will not make it inland for today. This will instead be
good soaking rain, with half an inch to an inch of rain likely
along the coast.

Another interest for Monday morning is the potential for patchy to
areas of fog. Stations have reported winds less than 5 mph (many
have calm winds). As of writing, the fog has begun to develop in
the Chehalis Valley (along I-5 from Chehalis to Olympia and up to
Shelton). The visibilities have varied from a quarter mile to 2
miles. Will continue to monitor this morning for a possible dense
fog advisory, but in the meantime, motorists should remember to
use low-beam headlights and allow extra following distance behind
vehicles. Check road conditions before traveling.

Going into Tuesday and Wednesday, the previously mentioned trough
moves inland and fills even more as it becomes positively-tilted.
It will absorb back into the meridional jet pattern up in Canada,
allowing for a new upper level low/shortwave tor dig southward
from the coast of B.C. Canada. This will drag a cold front into
the region, which will cool temperatures (highs dropping
substantially from Monday into Tuesday going from the upper 70s to
the low 70s). There will be at least some instability for showers
and isolated to scattered thunderstorms Tuesday, especially in the
afternoon. A few of the stronger cells may produce brief heavy
rain, with NBM suggesting totals for most areas at around a
quarter of an inch (increasing to half an inch along the coast by
midnight Wednesday). Wednesday will virtually be a repeat of
Tuesday, with similar rainfall totals.

Bottom line: it will be wet and cool this week, perhaps feeling a
little bit like fall.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...The troughing/upper level
low pattern will continue through the weekend (very good agreement
between models). A jet max Thursday may help support another round
of thunderstorms with rain/showers throughout the day. There
appears to be some instability in the models to support the chance
of thunder for the day. The instability decreases Friday into
Saturday, which will leave the region with just rain/showers to
finish up the week. The cool temperatures will continue through
the weekend (might even struggle to break 70 degrees in Puget
Sound on Wednesday).

The fall-like pattern appears to break Sunday going into next
week, as ensembles show the troughing being replaced with zonal
flow and weak ridging. CPC`s 8 to 14 day outlook does have a 60 to
70 percent chance of above average temperatures from August 26th
through September 1st. A look at high temperatures early next week
shows a return of 75 to 80 degree highs in Puget Sound/Southwest
Interior by next week Monday.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A few patches of low clouds or fog evident in the lower
Chehalis valley and a few of the river valleys further north, with
these ares likely to increase toward daybreak in the wind sheltered
areas. Meanwhile, the next front remains offshore and will spread
some low and mid clouds into the coastline this morning and
eventually across the Olympic Peninsula. Showers return to the
coastal terminals this afternoon but otherwise not much in the way
of impacts inland today.

KSEA...VFR under partly sunny skies with light winds early this
morning. Southerly winds increasing to around 10 kt this
afternoon, shifting to southwest as the front approaches.

.MARINE...A low remains centered offshore beyond the coastal
waters today with a front spreading across the waters. This will
support winds increasing to around 20-25 kt. Furthermore, the
persistent southerlies will build short period seas to 6 to 8 ft at
around 7 seconds. Largest and steepest seas will be beyond about 20
nm from shore.  Therefore, the SCA for the coastal waters remains in
effect. Seas will subside into the 4 to 6 ft range thereafter.
Another low drops south toward the region later in the week around
Thursday or Friday, with stronger onshore winds following into next
weekend. Cullen

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...An upper level low and surface trough will
begin to move inland today. Some clearing will take place Monday
morning, leading to fog in low-lying areas. Rain showers are
expected for areas west of I-5 today. The threat of convection
remains low, and rainfall totals may approach 0.50-1.00 inch in
the Olympics and coast today.

A cold front will swing through the region with the next upper
level low/trough Tuesday, which will cool temperatures. There will
be several chances for showers and thunderstorms Tuesday through
the weekend, with the best chances for thunderstorms Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday.
