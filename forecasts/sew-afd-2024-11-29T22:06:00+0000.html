Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
206 PM PST Fri Nov 29 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak disturbance will produce a couple showers
across coastal areas and the North Interior tonight and Saturday.
The ridge will strengthen over the weekend into early next week
for dry conditions and widespread night and morning fog. The ridge
will weaken enough during the second half of next week to allow
for a returning chance of precipitation across the area.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The coast and northern
portion (near the Canadian border) may see light warm frontal
precip tonight into Saturday with just a few hundredths expected
(if anything). Otherwise, much of the region will be dry through
the weekend and early next week with high pressure over the area.
We`ll see a mix of high clouds and patchy low clouds and fog
(mainly during the morning hours). Temperatures will be cool and
in the 30s with a few spots near freezing. Highs will be in the
40s each day. 33

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The ridge remains anchored
over the region moving through next week which leads to more dry
and stable weather. Temperatures continue to track cooler than
average with lows in the 30s and highs in the 40s. The air mass is
a little warmer by midweek with readings closer to average.
Ensemble members are picking up on rain returning by Friday and
weekend although total rainfall amounts are light. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level transient ridge continues to keep the
flow aloft northwesterly through the weekend. This will keep flow
down at the surface light with south winds less than 8 kt at the
surface through today. Tomorrow morning: the winds will become calm
or variable at less than 5 kt for the entire coverage area.

CIGS this afternoon are a mix of MVFR/VFR (with SCT or BKN around
2,000 feet still burning off). Couple isolated pockets of IFR remain
around and west of KPWT and KSHN, and also around KSMP and pockets
of the Cascades. These areas may take longer for the low clouds to
lift up. Another round of fog or low clouds is likely tonight into
Saturday morning. Newer NBM guidance has been backing off somewhat
on the chances of the widespread LIFR conditions (most likely due to
prolonged cloud covering sticking around this afternoon), but if
winds are virtually calm (with weak forcing aloft), it will allow
for moisture to mix down towards the surface. Highest confidence at
this time for the low clouds/fog are pockets of the Southwest
Interior, Kitsap Peninsula, and Southwestern Snohomish County, with
timing early to late Saturday morning.

KSEA...2,000 ft BKN/SCT cloud deck is slowly eroding this afternoon,
but will transition to VFR with CIGs at or above roughly 5,000 feet.
Winds out of the south up to 7 kt will diminish going into tonight,
becoming light and variable Saturday. Tomorrow morning will be more
of a low CIG obstruction (rather than a VIS) - NBM guidance gives a
40% chance of MVFR, 25% chance of IFR and 15% chance of LIFR CIGs
Saturday morning. Timing will have the low clouds arrive from 09Z
through 18Z Saturday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The same high pressure/upper level ridge pattern will
continue over the waters through this weekend. Pockets of dense fog
will remain possible during this time with weak gradients keeping
moist air in place. Winds will be light through the weekend, with
light southwest winds at or less than 5 kt, and wave heights of 3 to
5 feet increasing to 4 to 6 feet through Sunday. A nearby
disturbance Monday will bring the waves up to 6 to 8 feet, but these
will decrease going into midweek as high pressure returns. Winds are
not expected to be greater than 15 kt from the south with this early
week disturbance.
