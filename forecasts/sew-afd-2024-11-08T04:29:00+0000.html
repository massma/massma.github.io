Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
829 PM PST Thu Nov 7 2024

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Shower activity over Vancouver Island will slowly shift
southward towards western Washington tonight and into Friday
morning as an upper level trough inches closer. Precipitation
remains on track to slowly move inland Friday afternoon through
early Saturday morning, with localized breezy winds. The current
forecast remains on track with no updates this evening.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SYNOPSIS...A series of systems will then bring unsettled weather
starting Friday night and throughout early next week, consisting
of lowland rain, mountain snow, chances of thunder, and breezy
conditions.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High clouds under high
pressure aloft will continue to increase overnight with lows in
the 40s. The next system stalls offshore on Friday keeping
western WA mainly dry. Temperatures will track warmer than average
with highs in the lower 60s again. Precip gradually spreads east
and inland Friday night and Saturday as a trough moves in for a
rainy period of weather. Given the slowness of the system, we`re
looking at rainfall totals ranging from 0.25-0.75" for most
lowland areas. Snow levels will be high, over 5000`, for mainly
rain in the mountains too. Brief ridging brings a short break in
the weather on Sunday. 33

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...A pair of deep upper lows
over the NE Pacific will help steer stronger and wetter systems
through western WA next week. Wave after wave of moisture/rain
will lead to rising rivers and possible river flooding,
especially the Skokomish River in Mason County. The air mass will
be slightly unstable too with a chance of thunderstorms (Sunday
night through Tuesday and mainly along the coast). Snow levels may
dip to around 3500-4000` with snow at the higher Cascade peaks
and passes. It`ll be breezy to locally windy too with highest
winds at the coast and north interior. Overall, a wet and blustery
week ahead. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The upper level ridge will continue to shift eastward
and flatten, allowing for current westerly flow aloft to
gradually transition to southwesterly flow on Friday. Surface
winds remain generally light and out of the southeast, primarily
at 3-5 kts tonight.

Mid to high level cloud cover will continue to stream in overhead
tonight into Friday with a frontal system offshore impacting
British Columbia. VFR conditions continue area-wide tonight and
will remain that way for most terminals throughout the TAF period.
The only exceptions will be locations more prone to lower cigs,
such as KOLM and KPWT. With enough clearing, expect some fog
formation and some visibility restrictions late tonight into
early Friday morning. Any fog that does form looks to scatter and
lift between 18-20Z.

KSEA...VFR conditions will remain in place for duration of TAF
period, although will continue to see an increase in high clouds
streaming in overnight. Surface winds generally light
southeasterly at generally 5 kts or less. Winds will remain light
but transition to more southerly by late Friday morning.

18/14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface ridging remains centered east of the Cascades
producing light offshore flow. A warm front will stall out over the
offshore waters tonight. A weak cold front will move across the
waters on Saturday before a much stronger frontal system follows
Sunday night into Monday.

Seas generally ranging between 7 to 9 ft tonight. A small portion
of the northern coastal waters may see seas briefly at 10 ft, but
this is not expected to be widespread nor long lasting enough to
warrant any headlines at this time. Seas reaching 8 to 10 ft will
be more uniform in both time and extent by Friday evening...so
additional headlines might be needed. Active weather over the
weekend will foster further wave growth, but a strong system
on Monday will allow seas to increase sharply, up to 17 to 20 ft.

18/14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...A weakening frontal system will move through Western
Washington later Friday night and Saturday for increasing rain,
although at this time QPF amounts are expected to remain lighter. A
more significant chance of precipitation is expected Sunday through
Monday, and again on Wednesday as an active weather pattern returns.
At this time, the Skokomish River is the only river forecasted to
rise into flood stage, and potentially moderate flood stage during
the middle of next week. For other rivers, significant rises are
expected and flooding could be possible, but at this time is not
forecasted. Flooding extent will depend on rainfall rates,
temperatures, as well as snow levels with precipitation that falls
with each of these weather systems next week. River levels will
continue to be monitored during this period. JD
