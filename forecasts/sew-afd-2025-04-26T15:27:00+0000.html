Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
827 AM PDT Sat Apr 26 2025

.SYNOPSIS...High pressure remains in place through the weekend,
with some cooling on Sunday. A weak frontal system will move into
the area early in the week for light precipitation, with ridging
rebounding in the second half of the week.

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Stratus continues to work its way north into Puget Sound
this morning (coming in from a push on the south side of the
Olympics). This will likely put a damper to some of the high
temperatures expected for today (more mid 60s instead of temps
closer to 70). The cloud coverage will most likely clear out once
it warms up getting closer to the afternoon.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Some stratus has made it to
the southern coast early this morning, primarily impacting Grays
Harbor County. It is unlikely that much more stratus will get any
further east than Olympia throughout the rest of the morning.
Isolated pockets of lower clouds are possible in portions of Puget
Sound but will not be widespread if they develop. Onshore flow
will get a bit breezy at times by early this afternoon, primarily
in the southwest interior, along the coast and through the Strait
of Juan de Fuca. Gusts of 25 to 30 mph are possible through the
Strait and along the coast. Temperatures today will still be in
the mid to upper 60s across Puget Sound and low to mid 50s along
the coast.

A weak low traversing to the south by Sunday will cool things off
a bit into the low 60s and upper 50s and keep Washington under
split flow aloft. A more zonal flow pattern sets up on Monday and
opens the door for the next weak system to arrive Monday night
into Tuesday. QPF amounts are generally light, under a quarter of
an inch with the exception of the coast and north Cascades seeing
slightly above a quarter inch. This system has high snow levels,
keeping rain in the forecast for all Cascade passes.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Rain is expected to taper
off by late Tuesday morning, with lingering showers in the
Cascades. A ridge returns by Wednesday, bringing back warmer
temperatures through Thursday where highs could reach the mid 70s.
Chances for rain return late next week, but some timing
discrepancies between the models right now limit what to expect
in terms of rainfall amounts.
