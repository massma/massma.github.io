Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
831 AM PDT Mon Oct 14 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A series of frontal systems will bring rain, mountain
snow, and progressively cooler temperatures to Western Washington
through much of the week ahead. Conditions will turn milder by
the weekend with the potential for locally heavy rainfall.

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No major changes to the forecast below. Clouds will
increase throughout the morning as the first rain approaches the
Washington coastline this morning from the west. Expect rain
showers to trickle inland throughout the day today into tonight,
with a little bit of a break Tuesday before the next system rolls
in.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...The first of a series of
frontal systems poised just offshore this morning will spread rain
to coastal areas around daybreak and across much of the interior
by this afternoon and evening. QPF with this initial system
remains on the light side. We`ll see a relative break in the
precipitation late tonight into Tuesday morning before the next
in a series of fronts spreads more rain onshore Tuesday afternoon
into Tuesday night. A cold front will push onshore Wednesday
morning and this along with trailing upper trough will usher in a
colder air mass. Rain will turn to showers by Wednesday afternoon
and the colder temperatures aloft (around -28 C to -30 C at 500
millibars) will destabilize the atmosphere enough to warrant the
mention of a slight chance of thunder...especially coastal areas
and in the post-frontal convergence zone. Snow levels will tumble
to 3500 to 4000 feet by late Wednesday night and it looks likely
that the higher passes will pick up their first snowfall
accumulations of the season.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...The upper trough axis will
move across the area on Thursday keeping showers in the forecast.
Weak ridging aloft is expected to nose onshore on
Friday...allowing some of the area to catch perhaps 12 to 18 hours
of dry(ish) weather. The gulf between the ECMWF and GFS
deterministic runs as well as their ensembles has narrowed
somewhat compared to the solutions of 24 hours ago with regards to
the upcoming weekend. They continue to advertise a rather
traditional atmospheric river funneling significant moisture into
Vancouver Island and much of southern British Columbia on
Saturday with snow levels across Western Washington climbing back
above 8000 feet. The moisture axis could then sag southward into
Western Washington on Sunday. At this time, there`s still a
significant amount of uncertainty regarding QPF totals as only a
minor north or south shift of the AR would have a substantial
affect on precipitation totals. Portions of the Olympic Peninsula
and North Cascades could stand to pick up the heaviest rainfall as
things stand. Stay tuned. 27

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft will continue through tonight
into Tuesday with an upper trough located over the Northeast
Pacific. A frontal system is approaching Western Washington offshore
this morning with rain finally making it to the northwest coast.
Stratus along the Olympic Peninsula will continue to slowly slide
eastward this morning into portions of the Southwest Interior and
potentially Puget Sound. Generally MVFR/IFR cigs with the stratus in
these areas through the morning. Localized fog may also develop
prior to increasing stratus and high clouds, mainly in river
valleys, and towards KOLM, KPWT, and KBLI. The front will then move
across the area later in the morning and through the afternoon, with
light rain during this period. Cigs will also mainly be MVFR, or low-
end VFR, with the frontal passage. Light rain may also linger
tonight into early Tuesday, primarily for the interior. MVFR for
most areas into Tuesday morning, with some VFR along the Olympic
Peninsula. Southerly winds will increase this morning with the
front, with breezy conditions for a few northern terminals,
especially KBLI and KPAE with gusts to 20 to 25 kts. Winds will
taper off tonight.

KSEA...VFR conditions this morning with increasing high clouds ahead
of a frontal system. Otherwise, expecting increasing mid and high
clouds today, with increasing rain potential generally after 19-20z.
VFR cigs midday are forecast to lower to MVFR conditions later this
afternoon into this evening. MVFR cigs expected to then continue
tonight. South winds ranging 5 to 10 kts, will transition more
southwest this afternoon. There is potential in the forecast for
Tuesday morning for a combination of post-frontal lower ceilings as
well as north winds, so that combination will be monitored and
updated in the TAF throughout the day. JD/Kristell<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southerly winds are increasing across the Coastal Waters
this morning ahead of a frontal system that will move across the
area today. Small Craft Advisory winds are expected to continue for
the Coastal Waters through this morning, before winds transition
northwest and taper off later this afternoon. In addition, SCA
southerly winds are expected this morning for Admiralty Inlet. A SCA
has also been issued for the northern inland waters for the
potential of SCA wind gusts. Probabilities suggest a 60 to 90%
chance of wind gusts exceeding SCA threshold in portions of the
northern inland waters, particularly near Camano Island as well as
east of the San Juan Islands. Winds for the interior waters will
generally become lighter by early Monday afternoon after the front
moves through the area. There may also be brief SCA wind gusts for
the eastern and western Strait of Juan de Fuca this morning, but not
expected to be widespread. A rather weak westerly push will follow
the front this evening into early tonight.

Winds are expected to continue to ease tonight through Tuesday.
Another front will move through Tuesday night into Wednesday with
increasing southerly winds during this period. Additional headlines
may be necessary with this weather system. Another, stronger
westerly push is then expected on Wednesday for the Strait of Juan
de Fuca. Winds will transition more northerly for the Coastal Waters
on Thursday, before another potential front into the weekend.

Seas will build to 10 to 13 feet this morning and continue into
tonight. Small Craft Advisories continue for the Coastal Waters for
this reason through tonight. There may also be a brief period of
seas near 10 feet for the far westernmost portion of the western
Strait of Juan de Fuca, but not expected to be widespread across the
zone to warrant a SCA. Seas will then subside below 10 feet on
Tuesday. Seas may then build again to 10 feet Wednesday through
Thursday. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
