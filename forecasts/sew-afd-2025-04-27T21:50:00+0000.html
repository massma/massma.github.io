Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
250 PM PDT Sun Apr 27 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cloudy, cooler, and wetter Monday and Tuesday as a
weak frontal system moves through the area. A return to dry and
warm conditions is expected through mid-week with precipitation
chances returning late Friday into next weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery is
showing stratus ever so slowly scattering out from north to south
across western Washington. Skies may be able to clear as far south
as the northern Seattle metro, but expect much of southwestern
Washington to remain cloudy the rest of today with continuing
onshore flow reinforcing the stratus deck. Temperatures as of 2PM
are in the mid 50s, with highs today expected to reach the low
60s.

Clouds will continue to fill in tonight into tomorrow a subtle
upper-level shortwave trough sends a weak cold front towards the
area. Rain chances will begin across the northwestern portions of
the area Monday afternoon, spreading across the area overnight and
will be mostly dry by Tuesday morning, except some lingering
showers over the mountains. Snow levels look to remain above 5500
to 6000 ft. Tuesday looks to be the coolest day of the next with
highs in the upper 50s, approaching 60.

Temperatures will begin to return to a warming trend as conditions
dry out and skies clear out with an upper level ridge beginning to
reestablish itself over the northeast Pacific. Highs Wednesday in
the mid 60s.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...The ridge axis will be
overhead Thursday morning, thus that being the warmest day.
Temperatures look to reach the mid to upper 70s for many, through
notably cooler across the north interior and the coast (upper
60s). We could be approaching 80 degrees across the southwest
interior and some of the Cascade valleys.

Models are in agreement in the development of a deeper upper level
trough moving in Friday into Saturday, with the primary
difference how far south the trough will dig. Cooler temperatures,
as well as chance for precipitation Friday into Saturday return
to the forecast, though exact timing and QPF amounts are uncertain
at this time.

level stratus clouds covering most lowlands (except for the
strait). Ceilings are generally within MVFR to low-end VFR. High
pressure will shift inland tonight with stratus clouds lowering
and MVFR across the board. A weak frontal system will clip the
coast Monday evening as high pressure exits. Rain will continue to
spread across the area Monday night into early Tuesday. 33

to 10 kt. Rain moving in after 00Z Tuesday. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

across western WA. Highest wind is over the Strait of Juan de
Fuca. High pressure will shift inland on Monday with winds easing.
A weak frontal system will cross the waters late Monday into
Tuesday. High pressure is along the coast on Wednesday, with the
flow turning more southerly late in the week ahead of the next
