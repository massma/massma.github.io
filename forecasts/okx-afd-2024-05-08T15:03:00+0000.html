Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
1103 AM EDT Wed May 8 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
A warm front pushes to the northeast while a cold front moves
through late today into this evening. The cold front then stalls
just to the south tonight with developing low pressure approaching
Thursday and Thursday night and stalling over the area on
Friday. The low pressure then moves east of the region Friday
night. Weak high pressure briefly builds in Saturday before
another low moves across late Saturday into Sunday. Weak
offshore high pressure establishes for early next week.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Warm front and the associated showers and thunderstorms have
shifted north this morning. As much of the area warm sectors,
skies will become gradually clearer especially for areas to the
west with a more westerly component to the wind. This will allow
for fairly quick surface heating and temperatures rising
quickly through the early afternoon.

By early afternoon as the warm front by and large gets
northeast of the CWA forecast soundings indicate a fair amount
of instability in the mid and upper levels. SPC has placed the
region in a marginal risk of sever weather. The amount of
convective coverage is very much in doubt as convective
initiation may be difficult to achieve as some guidance
indicates significant drying of the column which would not be
conducive for updrafts to survive due to dry air entrainment.
Also forecast soundings indicate a weak mid-level CAP. Thus it
may be difficult to get parcels to the LFC. With this said,
there may be enough to get a few isolated storms to pop based on
potential CAPE of 800 to 1500 J. Mid levels appear rather dry
relatively speaking, so the main concern with any pop-up storms
would be strong, gusty winds with DCAPE values of 800 to 1000 J
with an inverted V type sounding. Chose to go with iso to slight
chance of thunder with gusty winds wording with regard to any
pop-up storms. Winds will be out of the south and should result
in a large temperature spread across the region with developing
mid to late afternoon sun from west to east. Temperatures by the
afternoon are likely to range anywhere from the lower to middle
80s across western sections, to the 70s, with mainly 60s across
coastal and eastern most sections. Overall temperatures average
above normal for today into tonight, but there will a wide
spread in temperatures this afternoon with a southerly
trajectory to the wind. Some 50s are possible or even likely by
the start of the evening across the twin forks of Long Island.

For tonight the region should be in-between weather disturbances.
Another low pressure system takes shape across the Midwest with a
frontal boundary extending east into the Ohio Valley. This
boundary likely approaches towards midday Thursday as a warm /
stationary front as low pressure moves into the Ohio Valley.
After some clearing late Wed and much of Wed night clouds should
increase again towards Thursday AM. It should remain rain free
through tonight with temperatures averaging somewhat above
normal with lows in the 50s, and around 60 in the NYC and NE NJ
metro.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/...
The column is expected to gradually moisten during the day Thursday
with more clouds arriving in advance of a frontal boundary to the
immediate south and southwest with developing low pressure over the
Ohio Valley. The system will move east and with the area being just
north of the boundary and low pressure look for the column in the
lower and mid levels to remain stable with an onshore flow out of
the ENE. This should lead to a stratiform rain / shower activity.
This activity will become more widespread Thursday evening. On and
off rain is anticipated for Thursday night. WPC has maintained a
marginal risk of excessive rainfall for much of the region, but
rainfall rates appear quite underwhelming, thus flooding related to
heavy rainfall is not a concern at this time. Temperatures should
average closer to normal for the most part during this time, perhaps
a few degrees below average in some spots during the day Thursday.

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
Upper-levels will have us in a troughing pattern through the weekend
with two mid-level shortwaves, one Friday night and a larger, slower-
moving one late Saturday into Sunday with high pressure only
briefing present between the two. These shortwaves, each with an
associated surface low, will bring chances for showers. More rain
will be likely across the area with the first shortwave with higher
PWATs in place. After Friday, the column dries out more, but in
addition to showers, thunderstorms look to occur on Sunday aided by
cold air advection aloft from the deepening trough. Temperatures
will be below seasonal with highs in the mid-50s to near 60.
Saturday and Sunday will be a little warmer in the low/mid-60s.

A fairly zonal pattern settles in aloft for the first half of next
week with weak high pressure at the surface. This will keep us in a
mostly dry pattern with only slight chance POPs Monday night through
Wednesday. Its highs will be warmer by Tuesday near or above
seasonal averages in the upper-60s to mid-70s.

&&

.AVIATION /15Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A warm front lifts through the region through this morning,
followed by a cold frontal passage this evening.

Ceilings will gradually lift and scatter out from west to east
today, with the eastern terminals taking the longest. KGON may
be as late as this evening (22Z-00Z). Thereafter, VFR expected
through 18Z Thursday.

Isolated showers and maybe a thunderstorm will be possible this
afternoon into the early evening. However, chances and
confidence too low to include at this time.

Winds increase from the southwest ahead of a cold front, and
then become westerly and gusty, up to 20kt. NW winds relax
below 10 kts following the cold frontal passage this evening .
Winds increase to 5-10 kts becoming north then northeast
tomorrow afternoon.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Brief MVFR possible the next couple of hour.

Low chance of SHRA or TS this afternoon, too low to include in
TAF at this time.

OUTLOOK FOR 12Z THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...

Thursday: Mainly VFR during the day with a chance of showers in
the afternoon, then MVFR or lower developing at night with a
continued chance of showers.

Friday: MVFR/VFR with chance of showers.

Saturday: Chance of showers with MVFR cond at KSWF, otherwise VFR.
Chance of showers at night with MVFR.

Sunday: MVFR/IFR with a chance of showers and possibly a
thunderstorm.

forecasts, can be found at: https:/www.weather.gov/zny/n90<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...
Winds and seas are expected to remain below SCA conditions through
Thursday night as seas will essentially average around 3 ft,
perhaps approaching 4 ft towards early Friday morning for the
southern portions of the ocean waters.

Sub-SCA conditions are expected through the long-term forecast
period with the exception of seas occasionally reaching 5 feet in
the eastern ocean Friday through Sunday.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
WPC has placed mainly western interior portions of the areas in a
marginal risk of excessive rainfall on Thursday. The risk of
flooding from heavy rainfall appears to be limited at this time for
later this week, and no hydrologic impacts are expected during
the long-term forecast period.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
Astronomical tides run high the next few days with the new moon from
last night.

Minor flood benchmarks are likely to be exceeded during the evening
high tide cycles tonight through Friday night for southern
Nassau, southern Queens, and Fairfield and Westchester counties
with inundation up to a foot. Coastal flood statements will be
in place for tonight`s high tide for Newark Bay in Hudson county
and southern Queens with water levels perhaps just touching
minor benchmarks. Localized moderate flooding is possible during
Fri evening`s high tides in the most vulnerable spots of
southern Nassau, with advisories and statements likely in
similar locations tonight, and perhaps including SW Suffolk and
portions of the north shore of Long Island in subsequent
evening high tide cycles through Friday. Statements may also be
needed for Thursday and Friday evening for portions of coastal
NE NJ and Staten Island.
