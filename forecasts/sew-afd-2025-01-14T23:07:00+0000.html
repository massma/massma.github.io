Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Another round of morning fog and low stratus expected
Wednesday as high pressure continues to persist over Western
Washington. A weak system on Thursday will bring back light
precipitation chances. Colder and drier conditions will persist
through early next week as high pressure rebuilds on Friday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Some locations across
Western Washington have managed to clear out the fog (along the
coast and north of Everett); however some locations along Puget
Sound are still experiencing reduced visibilities. High pressure
continues to dominate over Western Washington, which will bring
another round of morning fog and low clouds Wednesday morning.
across the interior lowlands and coast. A shift in the weather
pattern on Thursday as a weak system will move through the area.
Some light showers are possible along the north coast; however
the majority of the precipitation (light mountain snow) will be
concentrated along the North and Central Cascades. No significant
impacts are expected.

A colder and drying trend begins on Friday as high pressure
rebuilds over the Pacific Ocean. Patchy fog possible Friday
morning. High temperatures will be in the mid to low 40s; low
temperatures will be in the 30s.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Cold and dry conditions
will continue through the weekend and early next week with high
pressure building offshore. High temperatures through Monday are
expected to be in the low 40s, and low temperatures will be in the
low to mid 20s. With a colder airmass in place and temperatures
below freezing, fog formation will be limited.

The deterministic NBM hints at the possibility of precipitation
returning on Tuesday in the form of light rain/snow showers for
the coast and some of the lowlands. Model guidance also hints at
some light precipitation returning on Tuesday, but in the form of
rain. PoPs on Tuesday range between 20-25%. High temperatures
will be in the 40s and low temperatures in the mid to upper 20s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest to westerly flow remains over western
Washington as an upper level ridge moves over the region. Low
clouds, with IFR to LIFR cigs, remain in place over the central
Puget Sound area and along the Strait of Juan de Fuca, but clear
skies have emerged elsewhere. Not expecting much more clearing this
afternoon over the central Puget Sound, but expecting ceilings to
slowly rise to low-end MVFR by 00Z Wednesday.

Light winds will continue tonight into Wednesday, allowing for
ceilings to once again re-develop and drop to LIFR and fog to
redevelop by the early morning hours. Clearing will once again be
slow but models are trying to hint that clearing may be possible
Wednesday afternoon with less upper level cloud cover, but with such
light wind at the surface, it is plausible that the central Puget
Sound area once again never fully clears out before high clouds fill
in ahead of the next system coming in early Thursday.

KSEA...IFR conditions with low stratus over the terminal.  Light
surface flow will not allow for rapid changes, but expect ceilings
to remain IFR, slowly lifting to low-end MVFR this evening. Expect
LIFR to return early tomorrow morning with fog and low ceilings.
Clearing will once again be slow, but ceilings may be able to break
up faster, with improving conditions as early as around 21-22Z
Wednesday. Winds will remain light north/northeasterly, around 4 kt
or less through the TAF period.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface ridge over the coastal waters will shift inland
Wednesday night, maintaining weak northeasterly winds. A weak
frontal system will move through the region on Thursday morning.
Stronger high pressure will build in its wake on Thursday for
stronger northwesterly flow over the coastal waters and an onshore
push through the Strait of Juan de Fuca which may prompt additional
headlines. Building high pressure over southern British Columbia and
east of the Cascades will lead to a return to offshore flow late in
the week.

Seas remain around 10 ft through the outer coastal waters through
tomorrow afternoon, for which a Small Craft Advisory remains in
effect. Seas will likely rise above 10 ft again with the frontal
passage Thursday before subsiding this weekend into the beginning of
next week.
