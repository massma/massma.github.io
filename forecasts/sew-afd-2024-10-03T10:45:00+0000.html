.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Did you get asked what day
it is today? Satellite imagery shows clear skies over Western
Washington this morning. Some fog starting for form in the
Chehalis and Snoqualmie river valleys and near Cape Flattery.
Temperatures at 3 am/10z were in the upper 30s and 40s.

Upper level ridge over the area this morning shifting east this
afternoon. Patchy fog will dissipate by mid morning. Sunny
conditions will warm temperatures into the 60s this afternoon.
Could see a couple low 70s in the Cascade foothills.

Transition time tonight with the upper level ridge well to the
east and the next front approaching the area. Rain out ahead of
the front beginning along the north coast late tonight with a
chance of rain from about a Bellingham to Shelton line westward by
12z Friday. Increasing clouds in the early morning hours will
keep lows in the 40s.

Front moving through Western Washington Friday. Frontal passage
along the coast late morning, Puget Sound area early to mid
afternoon. Front reaching the Cascades late afternoon. Unlike most
of the recent fronts this one will stay together as it moves
through the area. Hurricane force winds on the summit of Mount
Rainier ( forecast 80 mph ). Decent rainfall amounts along the
coast with up to an inch possible. In general a quarter to a half
inch of rain for the interior. Surface gradients turning onshore
quickly post frontal with a convergence zone developing over
Snohomish county mid to late afternoon. Models have a small CAPE
bullseye there of about 300 J/KG. Will add a chance of
thunderstorms to Snohomish county extending east into the Central
Cascades late afternoon. Highs will be lucky to get out of the
50s.

Not a very big pool of cold air behind the front Friday night
with an upper level ridge building by early Saturday morning.
Post frontal shower activity outside of the convergence zone
decreasing Friday night. Convergence showers or thunderstorms
could last into the early morning hours Saturday. Lows in the 40s.

Post frontal onshore flow Saturday morning producing stratus over
the area. Subsidence with the upper level ridge building will
dissipate the marine layer by Saturday afternoon leaving sunny
skies. Highs in the lower to mid 60s.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Extended models continuing
to show good consistency in the 00z run. Upper level ridge over
the area Sunday. Ridge shifting east Monday but Western Washington
still on the backside of the ridge. Weak front stalling northwest
of the area close enough for a chance of rain from about Hoquiam
to Bellingham. Huge upper level trough starts moving out of the
Gulf of Alaska Tuesday. This will kick what is left of the front
through Western Washington. Upper level trofiness Wednesday will
keep a chance of showers in the forecast. Highs a little above
normal Sunday and Monday, mid 60s to lower 70s, cooling into the
lower to mid 60s Tuesday and near 60 Wednesday. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West flow aloft will become southwest today with a ridge
shifting east, and a trough/front approaching the region late
tonight/Friday. Skies will remain mostly clear/VFR throughout the
day today. Only exception will be the possibility of patchy LIFR fog
in low lying areas across the Southwest Interior and Puget Sound
this morning. These patchy fog areas will be very brief in longevity
(if they do develop). Surface winds will be light out of the north,
with turns to the east and south expected later tonight.

KSEA...VFR skies today. NBM guidance has dropped the chance of LIFR
down to 15% this morning for the threat of patchy fog, however
confidence in fog impacting the terminal is very low (will likely
stay south and west of the area). Surface winds N/NE 4 to 8 knots.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Seas are still holding over around 10 to 14 this morning
over the coastal waters (due to a departing low in the Gulf of
Alaska). The model trend has the seas lowering below 10 feet by mid
morning, so plan to keep the SCA in effect through 6 AM this morning
(but elevated seas may linger slightly past the expiration time).
Expect seas to drop back to 6 to 8 feet by this afternoon and
evening.

Flow is expected to turn from the north to the east (slightly
offshore) and again to the south later tonight. A ridge will build
over B.C. Canada, and a frontal system will pass through the region
Friday with rain showers. Seas and winds will be the main issues
with this system, as seas in the coastal waters and west Strait of
Juan de Fuca build back up to 9 to 12 feet Friday. Some gusty west
winds of 15 to 25 kt are possible in pockets over the coastal
waters. Issued a new SCA for the day Friday to cover the threat. In
addition, a stronger push in the central/east Strait of Juan de Fuca
may produce frequent gale gusts up to 35 kt - issued a gale watch
for the potential threat. Remaining inland waters may see brief
gusts to 20 kt with the frontal passage Friday afternoon.

Post front Saturday, the seas will drop back down to 4 to 6 feet,
and build back to 6 to 8 feet next week. Winds will remain light
around 5 to 10 kt during this period.
