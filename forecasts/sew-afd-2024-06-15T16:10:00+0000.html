Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
910 AM PDT Sat Jun 15 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A low pressure system will track inland today,
ushering in widespread shower and thunderstorm activity that will
continue through the evening along a convergence zone boundary.
Troughing will maintain unsettled conditions through the remainder
of the weekend and into next week as cooler temperatures and
periods of showers persist across western Washington.

* THUNDERSTORMS: Thunderstorm activity will spread across western
  Washington today, with the highest chance (30% to 40%) east and
  south of the Puget Sound this afternoon. Storms will be capable
  of producing small hail, gusty outflow winds to 30 mph, and
  locally heavy rainfall alongside lightning.

* FLASH FLOODING: Localized heavy rainfall is favored this
  afternoon and evening along a convergence zone east of the Puget
  Sound, with the potential for flash flooding and debris flows
  over the Bolt Creek burn scar along US-2 in the Cascade
  Mountains.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No updates to the forecast
anticipated this morning with trends remaining on track. We should
see the convergence zone become more organized late this afternoon
as onshore flow increases as well as increasing instability with
strong June daytime heating.  27


A broad upper level low will continue to slowly move inland
throughout the weekend, maintaining unsettled and cooler conditions
through the short-term. Moisture will continue to stream inland this
morning with onshore flow, allowing showers to continue as another
front approaches the region. Instability will slowly increase as the
sun comes up, with high resolution forecast model soundings showing
steep lapse rates and as much as 500 to 600 J/kg of CAPE in the
early to mid afternoon over the Puget Sound region. Thunderstorms
will be possible across all of western Washington into the afternoon
as precipitation continues, with storms capable of producing small
hail and graupel, locally heavy downpours, and gusty outflow winds
up to 30 mph alongside lightning. While most precipitation will
shift eastward by the evening, a convergence zone is favored to set
up east of the Puget Sound and persist through early Sunday morning.
Forecast models highlight the potential for locally heavy rain with
the formation of the convergence zone especially over the Cascades.
The Bolt Creek burn scar along US-2 remains susceptible to debris
flows, so a Burn Scar Flash Flood Watch remains in effect through
the evening. The afternoon instability will also be enhanced by cold
temperatures aloft, which will allow snow levels to lower to near
4000-4500 ft. The wet bulb effect may even allow snow levels to drop
as low as 3000 ft in heavier showers that develop over the
mountains, but confidence is low. The Cascade mountain passes will
likely not see any snow accumulation, but the highest peaks will see
light snowfall amounts through early Sunday. Cloud cover will stick
around for most of the day today, limiting high temperatures across
the lowlands to the upper 50s and low 60s.

Wet and buoyant conditions will continue on Sunday as a cold
front drops southward across the region, spreading another round
of showers and embedded thunderstorm activity southward throughout
the day. Instablilty will decrease on Sunday as the trough axis
shifts further southeastward, with ensembles showing CAPE values
peaking at 200 to 250 J/kg south of the Puget Sound. Temperatures
Sunday will warm a couple degrees from today, peaking around the
60 degree mark for most of the lowlands.

Upper level troughing will finally exit the region on Monday with
moist northwest flow filling in behind. A shortwave disturbance
passing over the Pacific Northwest will stir up continued light
shower activity over higher terrain as conditions start to dry out
across the lowlands. Temperatures will warm into the mid 60s with
snow levels rising above 6000 ft, diminishing any additional
snowfall over the mountains.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Ensembles highlight a
warming trend through the rest of the week, with temperatures
returning to typical mid June conditions near 70 degrees by
Tuesday and peaking well above normal near 80 degrees by
Thursday. Forecast models have also come into slightly better
agreement over weak flow throughout the week, with any chance of
light shower activity favored over the Cascades each day.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft early this morning becoming more
westerly by this afternoon as an upper level low begins to enter W
WA. As the upper low moves south and east, could see NE winds aloft
Sunday morning. Generally southwesterly winds at the surface will
become zonal with speeds increasing to 10 to 15 kts in the afternoon
with occasional gusts up to 25 kt possible.

Atmosphere starts to destabilize by late morning, with highest
instability stretching from HQM eastward through the south Sound,
then along the I-5 corridor through SEA and possibly as far north as
PAE. Will likely use this area to limit any potential TS mention in
12Z TAFs and eliminate any TS after 03Z. It should also be worth
noting that confidence will likely not exceed PROB30 for most
terminals, however could see to nudge SEA and BFI up to TEMPOs for
the early afternoon period. One plus to the instability will be
lifting cigs, returning VFR conditions to the area between 18-20Z.
Precip activity expected to start winding down after 03Z tonight.

KSEA...As discussed above, should see instability peak starting
around 19Z and thus will likely nudge up PROB30 from inherited TAF
to TEMPO. Most activity should shut down by 03Z or slightly after.
Winds remain generally southerly ranging 10-15 kts, however may
nudge upward to 15-17 kts this afternoon with gusts up to 25
possible. Speeds should ease after 03Z down to approx 8-12 kts.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Broad surface troughing will develop across the
waters through midday today before ridging gradually rebuilds over
the coastal waters this evening into Sunday as lower pressure
remains over the interior. This will increase onshore flow with
gusty winds exceeding 20-25 kt this afternoon and evening,
especially in the central and eastern Strait...where a Small Craft
Advisory will go into effect at 2 PM PDT this afternoon through 8 PM
PDT tonight.

By early/mid next week, broad surface ridging will develop over the
coastal/offshore waters, with lower pressure east of the Cascades.
This will maintain onshore flow with westerlies reaching small craft
advisory strength in the central/east strait daily in the late
afternoon and evening. Otherwise, fairly quiet conditions are
expected across area waters.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...Widespread showers and thunderstorms will continue to
spread across the region today, with convergence zone showers
favored to set up this afternoon and evening east of the Puget
Sound and continue through early Sunday morning. Locally heavy
rainfall is possible with these showers, and forecast models
continue to show the potential for 1 to 2 inches of rainfall over
the Cascades east of the Sound. The heaviest rainfall is expected
to occur between noon and 9 PM before rainfall rates weaken.
While this storm system is not particularly moist, the convective
nature of these showers could produce rainfall rates that meet or
exceed flash flood trigger thresholds. A Debris Flow Flash Flood
Watch remains in effect through the evening for the Bolt Creek
burn scar, where excessive rainfall may cause debris flows that
could impact US-2.
