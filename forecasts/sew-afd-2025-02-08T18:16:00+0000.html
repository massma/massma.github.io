Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
1016 AM PST Sat Feb 8 2025

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Current radar imagery shows a band of snow showers
pushing southeast through King and Pierce counties into the
Cascades. Expect scattered snow showers to continue across
Western Washington this morning. As temperatures gradually warm up
above freezing this morning, the snow will transition into
rain/snow showers. Scattered rain/snow showers will remain
possible throughout the day and should begin to taper off in the
late afternoon. Overall, the forecast remains on track. Refer to
the previous forecast discussion and updated aviation section
below.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...Upper level trough over Western Washington today
moving southeast tonight. Snow levels remaining near the surface
this morning. Narrow high amplitude ridge off the British Columbia
coast tonight into Sunday with drier northwesterly flow aloft.
Another upper level trough swinging through Monday from the
north. With the over land trajectory of this feature little
moisture will be associated with it. Dry northwesterly flow aloft
continuing into Wednesday. Pattern breaks down late next week with
a weather system possibly moving into the area by Friday.
Temperatures remaining below normal through the period.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/... <span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level trough axis
moving through early this morning. Satellite imagery not showing
much precipitation behind the trough axis but as long as the
trough is in the vicinity will keep a chance of showers in the
forecast. Snow levels will remain near the surface this morning
then lift a couple hundred feet in the afternoon. Snow
accumulations will be less than an inch. Highs mostly in the upper
30s.

High amplitude, but narrow, upper level ridge building offshore
tonight with the ridge extending all the way into Alaska. Some
residual showers lingering around in the evening but for the most
part it looks like a dry period. Cloud cover will keep lows mostly
in the mid 20s to lower 30s.

Upper level ridge remaining in place with dry northwesterly flow
aloft over the area Sunday. Light flow in the lower levels
combined with low level moisture will keep skies mostly cloudy.
Highs remaining cool, a couple of degrees either side of 40.

Ridge hanging in there Sunday night. Upper level trough along the
backside of the ridge moving down over the area Monday. This
feature will have an over land track through British Columbia so
there will be little in the way of moisture with it. There is a
chance it will mix things up enough Monday for some sunshine.
With the northerly flow aloft the air mass will remain cool with
highs once again near 40. A little less cloud cover Sunday night
will allow lows drop into the 20s with upper teens possible in the
colder locations. If the forecast holds look for another round of
cold weather advisories for Sunday night/early Monday morning.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Models in good agreement
Tuesday and Wednesday with the narrow high amplitude ridge
remaining offshore extending well to the north and dry northerly
flow aloft over the area. Tuesday and Wednesday morning have a
good chance of being the coldest mornings so far this season with
the cold air mass overhead, clearing skies and light winds. Lows
in the teens and lower 20s. Even with sunshine highs will only be
in the mid 30s to lower 40s.

Confidence in Thursday and Friday very low. Model solutions are
very inconsistent and the ensembles are not much help. There is a
general consensus that the chances for precipitation increase
especially Friday but how the pattern evolves is up for debate.
The ECMWF solutions bring another cool upper level trough and an
accompanying shortwave down the British Columbia coast Friday.
The GFS solutions have a negatively tilted front arriving from
the southwest. Both solutions have a wide variety of results
depending on timing and track of the features. The forecast right
now is a broad brush chance of rain or snow with low snow levels,
around 500 feet. Doubt this forecast survives more than a run or
two before changing. Felton

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak upper trough continues to slide across the
region today with increasingly northwest flow through the day. Weak
surface winds continue but a cluster of light snow near I-90 will
drift southward through the morning with local IFR ceilings and
visibility in snow. Otherwise, expect mostly lower VFR to MVFR
ceilings for most locations through the day with occasional light
rain or rain/snow showers bringing brief lower conditions.
Predominantly VFR ceilings late afternoon and evening, but with
light winds and air mass stabilizing, expect ceilings to lower mostly
to MVFR range.

KSEA...Snow/rain showers will remain with a mix of IFR and MVFR
through the morning. With marginal thermal profile, accumulating
snow should be minimal but expect falling snow to reduce visibility
at times. Ceilings trending closer to 3000 ft this afternoon as
showers wind down. Surface winds light/variable through the day,
with predominant direction likely to be northerly this afternoon
around 6 kt. Expect return to lower MVFR ceilings overnight with
widespread lower stratus.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...A weak surface trough over the coastal waters this
morning will shift inland this afternoon. A ridge will rebuild over
the offshore waters late today and remain in place into Sunday.
Surface ridging over the interior of British Columbia will
strengthen early in the coming week for modest offshore flow and
Fraser River outflow. A weakening trough will approach the coastal
waters late next week.  27

.HYDROLOGY...No river flooding in the next 7 days.
