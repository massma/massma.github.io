Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
745 PM PDT Tue Aug 20 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Cool and occasionally showery conditions are expected
through the rest of the week. Occasional isolated thunderstorm
chances will also be present from time to time, but are unlikely
to reach the intensity of those from this past weekend. A gradual
shift to warming and drying conditions is expected next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Some showers continue to
linger, especially over portions of the Olympic Peninsula, however
activity on current radar continues to diminish. The upper level low
responsible for this can be best seen on water vapor imagery,
putting the center of circulation over the South Sound area. Viewers
with a keen eye can spot this on visible but the clearest feature at
that wavelength is the surface low currently over the eastern
Pacific.

With activity continuing to dwindle, inherited forecast looks to be
on track for a brief period of dry conditions overnight tonight and
into early Wednesday morning before the next system enters into W
WA. That said, no evening updates expected for tonight. For
additional forecast details, please refer to Previous Discussion
section below.

From Previous Discussion...Shower activity continues to track
eastward across western Washington this afternoon with individual
bands/cells propagating to the northeast. Thus far, only a couple of
lightning strikes have been noted over the coastal waters, with no
strikes over land. That said, there is enough instability around to
support at least brief thunderstorm development this afternoon.
Sounding profiles and mesoanalysis show very skinny CAPE, not
supportive of much more than brief heavy rain, very small hail, and
erratic winds, and the occasional lightning strike.

The upper level low driving this activity will move east of the
area overnight. Quick on its heels, another low pressure system
will dig south from the BC coast down to the coast of southern
Oregon Wednesday and Thursday, supporting yet more shower and
isolated thunder potential. The low is then expected to lift
northeast Friday into Saturday, with wrap-around showers
continuing through this period. In all, it`s unlikely that there
will be any period that will be completely dry across western
Washington between now and Saturday.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...From Previous Discussion...By
Sunday through the first part of next week, confidence in the
details falls off. Consensus indicates roughly zonal flow, keeping
temperatures cool, but resulting in longer breaks between shower
activity. Looking out a bit further, long range outlooks show the
potential for ridging to develop leading to dry conditions and
temperatures rising to near or above normal once again.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mainly VFR to MVFR conditions in place as shower
activity tapers off by 21/07z. Onshore flow will allow for MVFR to
IFR stratus ceilings to spread inland early Wednesday morning. Most
locations along the Sound should see VFR conditions return by noon
Wednesday except for BLI, where MVFR conditions may linger.
Remaining terminals expected to remain MVFR for the TAF period.
Winds generally S/SW 10 kt or less.

KSEA...VFR through the evening. Chances for precip should be done by
21/03z. MVFR ceilings developing Wednesday morning with another
marine stratus push before returning to VFR around 21/18Z. Winds
generally S/SW 10 kt or less. 15/18<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Another low will drop down into the region Wednesday into
late week, bringing a weak front to the coastal waters. Additional
systems will move into the area waters over the weekend, bringing
increased onshore flow to the area and the potential for stronger
westerly pushes through the Strait of Juan de Fuca, although speeds
there are not expected to reach headline criteria throughout the
forecast period. Wave heights will generally range between 3-6 ft
over the next several days. 14/18<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
