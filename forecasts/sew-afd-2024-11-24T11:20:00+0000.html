Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
320 AM PST Sun Nov 24 2024

.SYNOPSIS...An upper-low will continue to churn off the PNW coast
as we start the new week with active weather. Conditions will
settle towards the Thanksgiving holiday as guidance hints at the
return drier weather but cooler temperatures.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Good morning, western
Washington.

Similar to what we`ve seen the last several days, broad troughing
remains situated off the Pacific coast. This feature has
maintained active weather for western WA as we`ll see today. As it
meanders it`ll swing subtle shortwaves into our area with
widespread showers in the forecast through Monday. A rumble of
thunder can`t be ruled out over the coastal waters. An upper-
ridge will build across the Inland northwest during this time but,
we`ll continue under a regime of moist southwesterly flow aloft.
Snow levels will hover around 2,500 to 3,500 ft so snow at the
passes is expected but should be met with no major impacts.
Temperatures will top out in the mid to upper 40s with overnight
lows in the upper 30s to lower 40s.

We`ll begin to see some progression as we edge into Tuesday. High
pressure will build over the NE PAC as the aforementioned trough
finally tracks inland. A few showers may linger during this time
but northerly flow aloft along with some subtle ridging will help
to trend things drier. Temperatures will be fairly similar
compared to the previous days with highs in the mid to upper 40s
with lows slightly cooler, ranging between the mid 30s to lower
40s.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Drier conditions well
into the week but NBM is keen on keeping slight PoPs in the
forecast. This can be attributed to another subtle shortwave
breaking off the ridge centered over the NE PAC, entering around
Thursday-Friday. Conditions are to also trend cooler as
widespread 30s show up in the overnight lows, possibly near
freezing towards the second half of the week.

.AVIATION...A stacked low pressure system will remain offshore
today with moist S/SW flow aloft over western WA. Expect rain at
times for much of the region. The air mass is slightly unstable
along the coast with a chance of thunderstorms. 33

KSEA...Rain today/tonight with ceilings dropping to MVFR range.
Winds SE to E around 5-8 kt. 33


&&

.MARINE...A 1000 millibar surface low west of Vancouver Island
will continue to gradually weaken today as it drifts slowly south.
However, winds for the most part will still remain within Small
Craft Advisory speeds for most zones. The low will fill and drift
in the Oregon coastal waters early this week as surface ridging
builds over the interior of British Columbia. Winds over western
Washington remain offshore throughout the period. 33



&&

.HYDROLOGY...The Skokomish River has since crested. However, the
river will remain near flood stage into Monday morning due to
additional QPF.

For the remainder of the rivers no flooding is expected at this
time. The lack of hydrologically significant precipitation and lower
snow levels into next week will limit runoff and reduce flooding
chances. Felton/McMillian
