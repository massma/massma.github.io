Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Rain, strong winds, and heavy mountain snow will
linger today as a low pressure system offshore moves inland this
morning. Conditions will dry out heading into Wednesday as upper
level ridging starts to build back into the area. A weak front
approaching the region on Thursday may bring some light showers to
western Washington before conditions dry out again on Friday.
Chances of light precipitation are possible over the weekend as
additional systems move into the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Lowland rain, mountain
snow, gusty winds, and high surf will continue through portions
of western Washington today. Details on the hazards have been
outlined below:

Winds: Winds will remain gusty as they gradually ease throughout
the afternoon hours today. Downed trees and power outages will
remain possible.

Rain: Expect rain to become more showery in nature by the late
morning hours. High res guidance does indicate a Puget Sound
Convergence Zone likely developing across Snohomish County by this
afternoon. Additional rainfall totals through tonight generally
look to range from a quarter of an inch to half an inch for areas
across the northern coast and northern interior and from half an
inch to 1.25 inches for areas across the southern coast and
southern interior, though locally higher rainfall totals will be
possible in any heavier banding that does develop. Showers will
then taper across the region by tonight.

Mountain Snow: Significant snowfall is likely across the
mountains today as snow levels hover between 3000-4000 feet.
Higher elevation passes like Stevens and White will likely see  a
foot or more of snow, with areas like Paradise likely seeing a
few feet of fresh snow. Snow levels look to increase towards 3500
feet during the day, so expect snowfall amounts to be a bit lower
near Snoqualmie Pass - where amounts are generally expected to
range between 8-12 inches. Snowfall amounts and rates will be
higher in any precipitation banding that develops.

High Surf: Buoy observations overnight have reported significant
wave heights around 30 feet just offshore. Large waves will
along the coast may bring significant erosion to coastal beaches
and may wash over beaches, jetties, and other structures
unexpectedly. Expect large waves to gradually subside this
afternoon.

The low pressure system will exit the area this evening. This
will allow for upper level ridging to start to build back into the
region by Wednesday for much calmer conditions across western
Washington. With ample moisture remaining the low levels from
recent rains, any clearing overnight will allow for areas of fog
to develop across the interior by early Wednesday morning. Expect
fog to scatter by the late morning and for afternoon high
temperatures to warm into the mid to upper 50s - with some spots
expected to warm to near 60.

A weak front then looks to approach the region on Thursday, but
looks to split and break up over western Washington. A few showers
will be possible across the area as a result, though expect
precipitation amounts to remain rather light at a few hundredths
of an inch for most spots. Areas along the coast may see a tenth
or two of an inch. High temperatures on Thursday will again be in
the mid to upper 50s, with a few areas expected to near 60.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Upper level ridging will
rebuild over the area on Friday and will bring a dry start to the
long term period. High temperatures will be in the upper 50s with
lows in the upper 30s to low 40s. Drier conditions do not look to
last too long however, as the upper level ridge axis shifts inland
on Saturday and makes way for an upper level trough moving into
the region. This will reintroduce chance of showers to western
Washington over the weekend. While there is still a decent amount
of uncertainty in the exact evolution of the pattern, precipitation
amounts at this time generally look to remain light with no
significant impacts expected at this time. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The disturbance continues to move east across the
region this morning with widespread rain and abundant low clouds.
Expect mix of IFR/MVFR ceilings across most terminals and conditions
to be variable as shower activity moves through. Meanwhile, gusty
southerly winds across the interior will begin to ease later this
morning, while westerly winds push through the Strait of Juan de
Fuca. This will likely lead to the develop of a Puget Sound
Convergence Zone this afternoon which will serve as the focus for
heavier rain and lower ceilings into the afternoon and evening.
Elsewhere, rain will subside but low ceilings will be persistent.
Some clearing overnight, paired with abundant low-level moisture,
will lead to some areas of fog from KPWT through KOLM with around a
20% chance for the Seattle areas terminals.

KSEA...Continued rain will maintain IFR to lower MVFR visibility and
ceilings through the remainder of the morning with gusty south
surface winds. Expect winds to ease late this afternoon and evening,
before becoming easterly or northeasterly at 5 kt overnight. With
some slight breaking up of the lower clouds overnight, around a 20%
chance of IFR fog developing toward 12z Wednesday.    Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...A strong low pressure system is bringing unsettled marine
conditions. A series of headlines (Storm Force Warnings and Gale
Force Warnings) are currently in effect for elevated winds across
the coastal and inner waters. Winds will begin to subside Tuesday
morning to Small Craft criteria. High pressure will build Tuesday
afternoon offshore, easing marine conditions. A weak system will
glide across the offshore waters on Wednesday night into early
Thursday morning.

Combined seas will build to 20-32 ft, with the highest waves along
the southern coastal waters. Waves will subside throughout the day
on Tuesday into Wednesday to 10-12 ft. Combined seas appear to
decrease below 10 ft Friday into Saturday.

.HYDROLOGY...A flood watch remains in effect for Lewis, Thurston
and Grays Harbor counties through this afternoon. Steady rain
coming to an end this morning over the Southwest Interior.
Forecast crests for the Newaukum River near Chehalis, Chehalis at
Grand Mound and the Chehalis at Porter are currently within about
a half a foot of flood stage. Too close to call at this point.
The forecast trend is for the rivers to remain below flood stage
but with more rain yet to come in next few hours will leave watch
up for another forecast package.

A flood warning remains in effect for the Skokomish River near
Potlatch in Mason county. The river will crest in the moderate
flood stage category late this morning and will remain above flood
stage through at least Wednesday morning.

No river flooding expected Thursday into the first part of next
week.

Some rainfall stats for Seattle. Total precipitation first 46
days of the year ( Jan 1 thru Feb 15 ), 2.61 inches. Total
rainfall last 10 days ( Feb 16 through 3 am this morning ), 2.68
inches. Felton
