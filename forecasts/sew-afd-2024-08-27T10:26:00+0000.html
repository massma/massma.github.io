Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
326 AM PDT Tue Aug 27 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A trough moving over the PNW will maintain showers
and below-normal temperatures for the area on Tuesday. High
pressure will build Wednesday onward, allowing conditions to dry
out and warm up into the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper-trough is present
across the PNW along with its associated cold front. This front,
stretching from British Columbia into western Washington and back
out in the Pacific is lifting moisture as widespread clouds and
rain is evident given latest satellite/radar analysis. Guidance
has rainfall continuing but becoming less widespread as the
morning progress. Showers and a PSCZ will linger in the wake of
the aforementioned frontal boundary. A few current temperatures at
this hour: Bellingham 57 F, Friday Harbor 55 F, and Port Angeles
55 F.

As alluded to, a convergence zone will persist into the day over
King County before 925-850mb winds shift more northwesterly and
steer it towards Pierce County by the evening. The heaviest
precipitation is slated to fall over the Cascades and higher
elevations given orographic lift. Showers are in the forecast
elsewhere but again, mostly over topographic barriers. Along with
showers, isolated thunderstorms are possible as the NBM hints at a
slight chance (15%) for the northern interior. With meager SBCAPE
(250 j/kg) and mid-level lapse rates becoming conditionally
unstable we`ll reflect the threat in this morning`s forecast
package. High temperatures will range throughout the 60s across
the CWA. Conditions are to dry out tonight as higher heights build
into the region with upper-level ridging looming offshore.
Overnight lows are to bottom out between the mid 40s to lower 50s.
Mostly clear skies, residual surface moisture, and efficient
cooling will reintroduce patchy fog across the area as well by
early Wednesday morning.

Large scale subsidence will ensue as upper-ridging gets
comfortable throughout the remainder of the short term. Here we`ll
see temperatures bounce back into the 70s on Wednesday and 80s on
Thursday. Abundant sunshine and the return of warm conditions
will feel much more like summer here in late August. Overnight
lows will again be in the 40s and 50s.


.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Guidance is in agreement in
regards to upper-level ridging and above normal temperatures
in the long term. A weak trough is slated to slide northward into
the region towards the beginning of next week. Uncertainty
remains over the intensity and exact placement of this low
pressure system. Upper and mid level moisture will likely increase
as a result towards the end of the weekend, which may lower
temperatures and allow for isolated shower and thunder activity to
form over higher terrain, but as of now confidence is low.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough will shift onshore over
Western Washington this morning as an associated frontal system
pushes eastward into the Cascades. The trough will move into
eastern Washington this afternoon with the flow aloft veering to
northwesterly. Increasing onshore flow in the wake of the front
will lead to gusty surface winds at times this morning. Ceilings
will be a mixed bag of MVFR and localized IFR in lingering
convergence zone activity over the interior lowlands this morning.
Ceilings are then expected lift to VFR most areas after 18Z and
scatter out by this evening.

KSEA...A mix of MVFR and tempo IFR ceilings will lift by late
morning then scatter out by late this afternoon. Surface winds will
become variable for a period this morning with the remnants of a
convergence zone in the vicinity of the terminal 11Z-16Z. Otherwise,
southwesterly winds 8 to 12 knots will veer to north/northwesterly
under 8 knots near and after 00Z. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Post-frontal onshore flow will continue to generate small
craft advisory winds and choppy seas over the coastal waters and
across portions of the Strait of Juan de Fuca today. Onshore flow
will begin to relax tonight into Wednesday as broad surface ridging
rebuilds over the offshore and coastal waters. Thermally induced
low pressure expanding northward along the Oregon and
Washington coast Thursday through Saturday will turn the flow more
northerly. Winds are expected to remain generally under advisory
levels across area waters with the exception of perhaps the southern
outer coastal waters. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
