Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
242 AM PDT Tue Aug 13 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper troughing over the region will promote onshore
flow and cooler temperatures today. Isolated showers and thunderstorms
will be possible in the North Cascades near the crest. Brief
ridging will build Wednesday with weak low pressure over the area
on Thursday. An upper low offshore may bring more widespread
precipitation over the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cool and cloudy weather
continues today with upper level troughing over the Pac NW.
There`s another threat of isolated showers in the North Cascades,
especially near the crest. Thunderstorm chances are higher east of
the crest where instablilty is the greatest. Elsewhere, may see
patchy light rain or drizzle along the coast with dry conditions
in the interior. With a thicker stratus layer in place, temps will
track below average with daytime highs in the 60s to lower 70s.

The trough exits east on Wednesday and heights will build for
slightly warmer weather. Onshore flow will also ease with more
sunbreaks in the afternoon and early evening. Temps will reach the
mid to upper 70s in the interior or just a degree or two shy of
normal. Northwest winds will keep the coast in the 60s.

Weak low pressure sweeps inland on Thursday with little change in
the sensible weather across the lowlands. Up in the mountains,
isolated showers expected over the Cascades with a slight chance
of thunderstorms near the crest. 33

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...An upper level low drifts
down from Canada and spins offshore as we move through Friday, the
weekend, and into early next week. The result is cooler than
average conditions through the period with highs in the 60s to
lower-mid 70s and lows in the 50s. Shower chances increase
Saturday night and Sunday as the low pulls additional moisture
into western WA. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Variable flow aloft as an upper-trough remains overhead.
VFR across W WA aside from locations on the coast (KHQM & KUIL).
However, the OVC cloud deck is forecast to lower to MVFR/IFR cigs
between 12-16z and remain before gradually rising back to VFR as the
morning progress. Surface winds generally remaining out of the west
to southwest for the TAF period between 5 to 10 kts. More low
stratus is expected rebound Tuesday night into Wednesday morning.

KSEA...VFR currently but with overcast skies. Cigs are expected to
lower to MVFR between the 12-14z time frame. CLoud coverage will
remain throughout the day but improvement to VFR is to return by 19-
20z. Winds continue to remain southwesterly 5 to 10 kt. MVFR cigs
again possible into early Wednesday morning.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A 1030mb surface high over the EPAC continues to
bring onshore flow over the area waters. Diurnally driven pushes
down the Strait of Juan de Fuca will occur each evening with the
best chance of SCA winds arriving Thursday night. Mist squeezing out
of marine stratus may reduce visibility at times. Seas will remain
around 3 to 5 ft through the rest of the week.
