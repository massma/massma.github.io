Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level high pressure rebuilds over the region
tonight and shifts eastward Thursday. The next front will arrive
on Friday with another round of rain expected across Western
Washington. High pressure returns over the weekend with dry and
warmer conditions before the next front brings rain chances back
to the region by around Tuesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure continues
to build over the region this afternoon with decreasing cloud
cover and temperatures still near or slightly below normal. Expect
that given the strengthening ridge and light winds overnight that
some patches of fog will develop in the more prone locations like
river valleys and wind-sheltered spots. Otherwise, the clear skies
will bring a rather cool night into the 40s for most and maybe a
few spots into the upper 30s. The ridge moves east on Thursday but
expect a dry day with temperatures trending a few degrees warmer.
The next front likely reaches the coast early Friday, bringing
another round of widespread rain to the region. Amounts along the
coast and in the mountains could reach 1.00 to 1.50 inches, while
totals around half an inch will be more common in the interior.
This will also knock temperatures back down a few degrees cooler
again.

Ensemble guidance remains in good agreement that the front will
move east quickly and bring rising heights again over the
weekend. This will bring another round of dry conditions and
temperatures into the upper 60s Saturday.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Guidance remains
consistent into the start of next week with temperatures climbing
another couple of degrees for Sunday and Monday over Saturday`s
afternoon highs. The next front may reach the region around
Tuesday to increase clouds, cool temperatures, and bring another
round of rain chances. Rainfall amounts with this system are
currently less significant, but enough to maintain another wetting
rain across much of Western Washington.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly to northwesterly flow aloft this afternoon as
weak ridging builds through the area tonight. VFR across all
terminals this afternoon will largely continue into tonight, the
main exception is possibly KOLM, where there is a 30% chance of
some patchy fog developing near KOLM and in lower prone river
valleys. Elsewhere, expect VFR continuing into Thursday morning
with partly cloudy skies.

KSEA...VFR continuing throughout the remainder of the day with
light and variable winds, turning N/NE at times but generally
remaining light.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow will continue over the coastal waters in
the wake of a cold front yesterday. Seas continue to be the main
hazard, with recent seas 15 to 18 feet, as observed at Buoy 41.
Seas are highest mainly in the outer water zones. These seas will
gradually taper as we head into Thursday morning generally 9 to 12
feet, and will continue to level off throughout. Seas by Thursday
afternoon will be 6 to 8 feet.

FLow becomes northerly into Thursday as surface ridging builds
throughout British Columbia. Another frontal system will pass
through the area Friday, building seas upwards 9 to 11 feet, with
the highest seas in the outer water zones. Elevated seas will
continue into Saturday morning before subsiding to 3 to 6 feet
over the weekend.
