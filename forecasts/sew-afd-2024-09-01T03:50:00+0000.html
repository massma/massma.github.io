Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
850 PM PDT Sat Aug 31 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Upper level ridging will maintain warm and dry
countdowns this weekend. An incoming shortwave trough will bring a
return to onshore flow and cooler temperatures on Monday, as well as
a few showers and thunderstorms over the Cascades. Temperatures look
to rise back into the 80s again mid-week as a transient ridge
develops as it moves through the region.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Forecast remains on track
this evening with clear skies over most of the area, but marine
stratus pushing onshore along the coastline. Previous discussion
follows.

The ridge axis will continue to move eastward tomorrow as an
upper level low moves onshore over southern Oregon and northern
California. Onshore flow will begin to redevelop near the coast,
but winds remain lightly offshore over the Cascades as the surface
thermal trough moves across the region. That being said, much
cooler along the Pacific coast tomorrow (mid 60s to mid 70s) while
remaining in the 80s through the interior and Cascades.

The upper level trough will pass through to the south on Monday.
This will allow for a chance for some isolated showers over the
Cascades, with a low chance for a couple of thunderstorms (10-20%).
Any thunderstorms that develop should be short-lived and isolated in
nature. Additionally, stronger onshore flow will develop, allowing
temperatures to cool region-wide into the upper 60s to low 70s
through Tuesday.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...A passing ridge looks to
build and move into the region Wednesday into Thursday, allowing
temperatures to quickly warm back up in the the 80s by Thursday.
Model solutions diverge looking at late week and into next weekend
with model ensembles generally favoring ridging continuing
through the long-term, indicating warmer and drier weather,
through a large upper-level trough from the Gulf of Alaska looks
to slowly encroach on the region, and some model solutions bring
it close to the region as early as this weekend. Additionally,
deterministic runs are showing the potential for a shortwave
trough to move through on Friday, though there are significant
differences in the location of this trough, and thus the chances
for some additional light showers is low and uncertain.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Western Washington will remain on the back side of an
upper level ridge through Sunday. West to southwesterly flow aloft
will become more southerly by tonight. Light offshore flow in the
low levels will continue tonight, but will transition to onshore
on Sunday.

Satellite this afternoon shows mostly clear skies across western
Washington, with conditions at all area terminals reporting VFR.
Expect VFR conditions to continue through the evening hours. Marine
stratus will push northward along the coast and inland into areas
southwest of the Sound overnight into Sunday. This looks to bring
IFR to LIFR conditions to coastal terminals, like KHQM. Stratus
may linger along the coast through the day Sunday, lifting by the
afternoon hours.

KSEA...VFR conditions. Northerly winds 6 to 10 knots. Winds will
become light again overnight and increase during the afternoon and
evening hours again on Sunday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...High pressure over the northeastern Pacific will
interact with thermally induced low pressure along the coast into
Sunday for generally calm conditions across the area waters.
Areas of fog associated with low stratus moving into the area may
reduce visibilities across the coastal waters at times through
the Sunday morning hours. Onshore flow will increase again on
Sunday as the thermal trough shifts inland. Winds along the Strait
of Juan de Fuca will increase Sunday night into Monday and again
Monday night into Tuesday, with gusts to 25 knots possible. High
pressure will then build back into the coastal waters on Tuesday
and interact with another thermally induced trough moving up the
coast on Wednesday.

Seas over the coastal waters will generally persist between 3-5
feet into Sunday. A brief uptick in seas to 6-7 ft is possible
over the outer coastal waters Sunday into Monday, however expect
seas to subside back to the 3-5 ft range again by Tuesday and to
persist within this range through midweek.

.FIRE WEATHER...An upper level ridge will continue to promote warm
and dry conditions this weekend. This, along with offshore flow in
the low levels, will allow relative humidity values to drop as low
as 15-20 percent in the central and southern portions of the
Washington Cascades and mountain valleys. Winds have been locally
breezy at times as it funnels through the valleys. Relative humidity
values will struggle to recover overnight, only reaching 40-60
percent in the mountains, more moist in the valleys. Lastly,
conditions are unstable with mid-level Haines reaching 6. Fuels in
zone 659 have dried to where ERCs now exceed the 90th percentile.
Therefore, a Red Flag Warning has been issued for the central
Cascades from early Sunday morning through Sunday afternoon. Moist
and cool onshore flow will begin to develop Sunday evening,
providing a rapid relief to the critical fire weather conditions.

With fuels drying region-wide, will have to watch the potential for
some isolated thunderstorms over the Cascades on Monday. While
storms are not expected to be widespread enough for Red Flag
conditions, little precipitation is expected and there is some
potential for a new fire start.
