.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Another day of possible record breaking high
temperatures for the Western Washington interior today. Upper
level ridge over the area early this morning moving east later
today and tonight. Thermally induced thermal surface trough also
moving east of the area later today. Increasing low level onshore
flow will bring cooler high temperatures to the region beginning
Wednesday. Flat upper level ridge with weak low level onshore
flow Thursday through the first part of next week with high
temperatures remaining above normal for the interior.

* HEAT...Today will be the warmest day for the interior. Along the
  coast high temperatures will occur in the middle of the day.
  Some cooling all areas Wednesday. A Heat Advisory remains in
  effect for most of the interior through Wednesday afternoon. The
  heat advisory will end along the coast today.

* FIRE WEATHER...Dry, hot, and unstable conditions continuing
  today for the Cascades. Red Flag Warning remains in effect until
  11 pm tonight.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
upper level ridge over Western Washington with clear skies across
the area. Temperatures at 3 am/10z were in the mid 50s to near 70.

Upper level ridge over the area early this morning shifting east
later today. Thermally induced surface trough over the area early
this morning will move into the interior midday and east of the
Cascades late today. Temperatures aloft remaining very warm with
850 mb temperatures in the plus 20C to 24C range this afternoon.
Highs for the interior in the mid 80s to near 100. Highs along the
coast are going to be a tough call. A difference of a couple of
hours in the westerlies kicking around midday could result in a 5
degree plus error. The ensemble spreads for Hoquiam and Quillayute
highs today are around 15 degrees. Westerlies should kick in
along the central coast before the north coast making the central
coast a little cooler. Highs in the mid 70s to lower 80s.

Thermally induced trough east of the Cascades tonight. Increasing
onshore gradients with the KUIL-KBLI gradient getting above plus
3 mb and the KHQM-KSEA gradient peaking around plus 3 mb. This is
strong enough to push some marine air into the interior by early
Wednesday morning. Lows in the 50s and lower 60s.

Onshore gradients continuing Wednesday but weakening during the
day. Temperatures aloft cooling with the ridge axis east of the
area but 850 mb temperatures still in the plus 16C to 20C range
late Wednesday afternoon. In general 5 to 10 degrees of cooling
for the interior with more cooling along the coast. This puts
highs in the mid 70s to upper 80s for the interior and mid 60s to
lower 70s for the coast.

Little change in the pattern Wednesday night and Thursday with
flat upper level ridge over the area and varying degrees of low
level onshore flow. Cooling temperatures aloft combined with
the low level onshore flow will continue the cooling trend over
the interior with highs in the mid 70s to mid 80s. Highs along the
coast will remain in the mid 60s to lower 70s. Lows Wednesday
night with the onshore flow will mostly be in the 50s.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Little change in the pattern
Friday through the weekend with flat upper level ridge over the
area. 500 mb heights remaining in the mid 580 dms. Weak low level
onshore flow continuing through Sunday. Models hinting at a weak
trough that could enhance the low level onshore flow Monday. Even
with the trough, ensemble means on both the GFS and ECMWF keep
Seattle highs in the lower to mid 80s through the period including
Monday ( and further into the middle of next week ). With the
onshore flow, late night and morning clouds along the coast will
try to make their way inland in the early morning hours. At this
point it looks like the clouds will stay west of Puget Sound.
The low level onshore flow will keep high temperatures for the
interior in the mid 70s to mid 80s. Highs along the coast mid 60s
to lower 70s. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong upper ridge axis continues to gradually shift
east of the region with southwesterly flow aloft. The low level flow
is light onshore, but will increase tonight and Wednesday. Clear
skies will continue across the area today apart from brief IFR/LIFR
fog/stratus in the vicinity of KHQM 12Z-16Z. Increasing onshore flow
tonight will bring IFR/LIFR in stratus to coastal areas by around
06Z tonight. Stratus will spread locally inland tonight to around
KSHN by sunrise on Wednesday.

KSEA...Clear skies. Surface winds generally N/NW 5 to 9 knots
backing to light S/SW after 09Z Wednesday morning.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Broad surface ridging over the coastal and offshore waters
will remain in place through the week. Thermally induced low
pressure over the interior of Western Washington will shift
eastward tonight resulting in an increase in onshore flow for the
second half of the week. Small craft advisory westerlies are
expected in the central/east strait late this afternoon and tonight.
A weak weather system passing well to the north of the area will
increase the onshore flow further on Wednesday with gale force
westerlies a strong possibility in the central/east strait Wednesday
evening. A fairly static summer onshore flow pattern remains
Thursday into the weekend for diurnally driven increases in the
westerlies in the strait and occasional small craft advisory
winds/seas over portions of the coastal waters.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Another dry and hot day for the interior. Instability
over the Cascades will result in critical fire weather conditions
and a Red Flag Warning remains in effect today for the Cascades.
For the lower elevations of the central and southern Puget Sound
relative humidity values could get as low as the teens late this
afternoon. While not reaching Red Flag Warning criteria this hot
spell has dried out fuels rapidly so lets be careful out there.
Onshore flow will bring higher humidities beginning Wednesday.

.CLIMATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Some records in jeopardy today, high temperatures
Seattle 93 (2010), Olympia 95 (1985), Bellingham 85 (1979). Record
high minimum temperatures Seattle 63 (2006) and Olympia 59 (1979).
One thing to note is the low temperatures could occur late this
evening when the marine air arrives into the interior. To
account for daylight time the 24 hour day is 1 am to 1 am.

The record for consecutive days with highs 80 degree plus in
Seattle is 15 ( June 25th through July 9th, 2015 and July 30th
through August 13th, 1977 ). The current streak started July 4th.

There have been 5 Julys with no measurable rain in Seattle, 2021,
2017, 2013, 1960 and 1958 ( all 5 years had a trace of rain for
the month ). Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
