Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A series of weather systems will move across Western
Washington through the weekend. The first system will move through
this morning quickly followed by the second system tonight into
Saturday. A third system will arrive Saturday night into Sunday.
Small break in the action Monday and Tuesday as the next system
stalls offshore before moving inland Wednesday and Thursday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
weather system over Western Washington early this morning. Back
edge of the system is approaching the coast at 11z/3 am. Rain
associated with the system being reported along the coast and
from about King County southward in the interior. Temperatures are
in the lower to mid 40s.

Negatively tilted system moving through Western Washington this
morning. Rain spreading a little further north as the system
moves through but might not get as far north as Whatcom county.
Satellite imagery indicating no cold air behind the system
keeping post frontal showers at a minimum this afternoon. Highs
today near 50.

Leading edge of next system already approaching 130W and being
pushed along by a 150 knot westerly jet. This system will move
into Western Washington Saturday with rain out ahead of the
system spreading over the area this evening. Snow levels hovering
around 3500-4000 feet. Winter weather advisory in effect for the
Cascades tonight and Saturday for 3500 feet and above. There is a
chance Mount Rainier could get another 2 feet of snow with
another foot to maybe a foot and a half elsewhere between tonight
and late Saturday afternoon. Easterly surface winds will keep
temperatures cold enough in Snoqualmie Pass ( 3000 feet ) for snow
there as well tonight. Winds at Snoqualmie Pass turning westerly
Saturday which will warm the temperatures up just enough to bring
about an end to the snow in the pass.

After another short break Saturday evening the next system arrives
later Saturday night into Sunday. This feature aimed mostly into
Western Oregon with Western Washington on the northern edge. This
system is another juicy one with IVT values even on the northern
portion of the system around 500 kg m-1 s-1 for another round of
rain and mountain snow for the area. For those traveling through
the passes Sunday another winter weather advisory is likely so
prepare for winter driving conditions.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Models in good agreement
that the next system in the series Monday will fall weaken and
move northeast before it gets to Western Washington. Will have just
a chance of showers in the forecast. Possible atmospheric river
setting up offshore Tuesday. 00z models have a wave developing on
the backside of the front which will slow the front down as it
approaches Western Washington. Possible dry day especially for the
interior Tuesday. Models have been pretty consistent for multiple
runs with an atmospheric river settling up over Western
Washington Wednesday with the feature possibly hanging around
Thursday ( will depend on how deep trough digging south offshore
ends up. The deeper the trough the more it will push the
atmospheric river north of the area ). Temperatures near normal
through Wednesday then a little above normal Thursday. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft this early morning becoming
more westerly by 12Z before ending up northwesterly this afternoon.
East to southeasterly surface winds this morning turning southerly
this afternoon. Wind speeds generally 5 to 10 kts for the TAF period
with some variations. PWT, OLM and CLM seeing wind speeds in the
morning 5 kts or less, picking up this afternoon while HQM is
currently seeing speeds 10 to 15 kts with gusts up to 30 kts, but
should ease by mid-morning...and perhaps returning to these speeds
this evening and tonight.

Cigs largely VFR, with some isolated MVFR/IFR conditions present as
of 2 AM PST, however as incoming system spreads rain throughout the
CWA, likely to see cigs erode to more widespread MVFR conditions by
mid-morning. While some slight improvement is possible late this
afternoon, an additional system passing through the area starting
this evening with another round of rainfall will limit any lifting
and allowing MVFR conditions to persist for the remainder of the TAF
period.

KSEA...VFR conditions early this morning, likely falling down into
MVFR between 15-18Z. Given how slow cigs have been to lower, may
lean toward 17Z for upcoming TAF issuance. Will see how rain
currently moving in makes an impact before making final decision.
While there may be a break in the rain late this afternoon, another
system moving in this evening will bring another round of
precip...so while cigs may nudge upward a little, likely to remain
MVFR for rest of TAF period. Light and variable winds becoming east
to southeasterly with speeds 6 to 12 kts.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Conditions nowhere near as active as past 24 hours,
however still active enough to warrant some lingering headlines.
Seas remain well above 10 ft, thus keeping SCAs up over the coastal
waters. Winds will pick up there during the day though...adding
depth to the headline. With this headline persisting, so will the
rough bar for Grays Harbor. While SCA for the East Strait will be
allowed to expire early this morning, winds will pick up again this
evening, warranting a second headline. With more systems expected
through Monday, there remains the potential for additional headlines.

Seas 14 to 16 ft will begin to increase to 17 to 19 ft this evening
in advance of the next system before finally establishing a solid
downward trend starting Saturday evening, reaching 8-10 ft by Monday
morning.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>System today not creating hydrologically significant
precipitation. Feature tonight into Saturday producing 1 to 2
inches of rain over the south slopes of the OLympics. This will
keep the Skokomish River above flood stage through the weekend.
Other rivers in Southwest Washington will also be on the rise.
While the current hydrographs have the lower reaches of the
Chehalis cresting below flood stage over the weekend the crest
values are still only a few inches from flood stage. Break in the
rain Monday and Tuesday will allow all the rivers to relax in
Western Washington. The Skokomish could drop below flood stage for
a brief time before going back over flood stage with the rainfall
Wednesday and Thursday. Three to five inches of rain possible
along the south slopes of the Olympics Wednesday and Thursday will
put rivers flowing off the Olympics and the rivers in Southwest
Washington under pressure again late next week. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
