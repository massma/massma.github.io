Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
309 AM PST Tue Mar 4 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weather system will move through the region Tuesday
resulting in widespread rain, mountain snow, and breezy winds.
Drying is expected through the day Wednesday with dry conditions
by Thursday. A more active weather pattern may bring lowland rain,
mountain snow, and breezy to windy conditions late this weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>More rain for western WA
today as a cold front and negative tilted trough shift inland.
The air mass is slightly unstable along the the coast with a
chance of thunderstorms too. We`re in post-frontal flow this
evening with showers mainly over the coast and mountains. Snow
levels are around 3,000 ft with 1-3" of new snow over the Cascade
passes (with higher amounts over the volcanoes).

A cool upper low will drift overhead on Wednesday with the jet
diving south into southern CA. There`s a chance of showers
although most of the activity will remain to our south and over
OR/CA. Morning lows will dip into the 30s although most spots
will remain above freezing. Highs will reach the lower 50s or
close to average.

We`re under drier, north, flow on Thursday as a ridge arcs north
into B.C. Areas around the south sound may see freezing temps
during the early morning hours, with mid to upper 30s elsewhere.
The direr air mass will keep skies mostly clear with afternoon
highs in the 50s. 33

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...High pressure will shift
inland through the end of the week, deflecting precipitation to
our north and into B.C. Warmer weather is in store for western WA
with highs in the 50s to around 60 this weekend. A front slowly
shifts inland Sunday night and Monday for a period of wetter
weather and a few more inches of snow in the mountains. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Increasing SW flow aloft today as an upper-trough pushes
into the region. Its associated frontal system will usher widespread
rainfall into the area, entering the coast by 14-16z followed by the
interior by 18-20z Tuesday. Periods of MVFR are favorable,
especially under precipitation. A return to BKN VFR cigs appear
likely towards the second half of the day. With residual surface
moisture and high surface pressure, can`t rule out patches of fog
and low clouds developing overnight Tuesday into Wednesday morning.
Increasing S/SW winds Tuesday, gusts ranging 15 to 25 kts for most
areas.

KSEA...Cigs have fluctuated between MVFR/VFR so far this morning.
Rain will increase around 18-19z at KSEA with cigs lowering into
mostly MVFR this afternoon, before improvement in cigs to VFR in the
early evening (23-02z) as rain tapers. S/SE winds 5 kt and below
will increase from the S/SW west midday Tuesday through Tuesday
afternoon with gusts up to 15-25 kts. Low-end VFR expected
overnight.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A developing low center offshore will sweep a front across
area waters starting this morning into the afternoon. This system is
bringing gusty winds falling under small craft criteria along the
west and east entrances of the Strait, and northern interior waters.
HREF guidance has wind gusts above 35 kt at 90 to 100% chance of
occurrence. This along with current scatterometer analysis increased
confidence for the issuance of a Gale Warning for the outer coastal
waters this morning before lessening in the afternoon. Winds will
gradually subside Tuesday night/early Wednesday morning below small
craft criteria. Weak high pressure will rebuild offshore late
Wednesday night into Thursday. The next frontal system looks to
approach on Friday, potentially bringing another round of small
craft winds into the weekend.

Seas 5-7 ft building to 8-12 ft by this evening. Highest seas
prevalent over the outer coastal waters. Waves will decrease
slightly on Wednesday morning, before building again Wednesday
evening/night to 9-11 ft. Another decrease in seas Thursday morning
below 10 ft. Seas will then build to 10-13 ft over the weekend.

.HYDROLOGY...No river flooding through Friday. Potential wet
system next weekend could push the Skokomish River above action or
flood stage by the weekend. There has been a lot of variability in
the rainfall forecast for the weekend. This situation will be
monitored closely through the week and could certainly change in the
next few days. The threat for river flooding on other rivers appears
minimal at this time.
