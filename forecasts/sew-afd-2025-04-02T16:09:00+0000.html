Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
909 AM PDT Wed Apr 2 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Troughing will continue over the region today,
maintaining unsettled conditions across western Washington. A high
pressure ridge will build inland Thursday through Saturday,
bringing dry and warmer conditions. Wet conditions are on track to
return by the end of the weekend and into early next week as
troughing returns.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Previous discussion...Radar
imagery early this morning shows continued convergence zone shower
activity east of the Puget Sound, and high resolution forecast
models show this activity holding strong through the late morning.
Elsewhere, onshore flow will continue scattered shower activity
throughout the day with snow levels near 2500-3000 ft.
Accumulation amounts will be light, with up to a tenth of an inch
of rain across the lowlands and up to an inch or two of additional
snow over the mountains. Shower activity will taper off through
the evening hours as drier air enters the region. Cooler
conditions will persist today under southerly flow, with highs
several degrees below normal in the low 50s across the lowlands.

High pressure will build offshore on Thursday and amplify inland
through Saturday, allowing conditions to warm up and dry out with
plenty of sun. Temperatures will reach the 60s across the lowlands
by Friday, increasing into Saturday with potential (10% to 20%
probability) to reach 70 degrees east of the Puget Sound.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Rain will make a return to
western Washington by the end of the weekend, though models show
some disagreement over the timing. Ensemble consensus shows
precipitation spreading inland throughout the day Sunday, with
accumulations up to an inch. With warm temperatures in place, snow
levels will remain elevated on Sunday near 6000 ft. Troughing is
on track to continue into early next week, bringing in cooler
temperatures and periods of locally breezy conditions alongside
lowland rain and mountain snow.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showers will continue across the area this morning for
a mix of MVFR/IFR conditions. Conditions will be slow to improve
through this afternoon to VFR but will generally be on an upward
trend as showers start to dissipate by the late afternoon hours.
Latest guidance shows the convergence zone near PAE to linger
through much of the afternoon before finally tapering, which could
lead to changes in conditions at times. A turn to more
northwesterly winds is expected for more terminals this afternoon,
generally after 03Z.

KSEA...MVFR at the terminal this morning, with southerly winds of
8 to 12 kts. The lower extent of the area of rain is clipping the
terminal, keeping cigs at 015 to 020 feet. Showers may linger in
the vicinity through much of the morning hours before breaking out
to VFR after 19Z. Winds will remain southwesterly at 5 to 7 kts
before turning to a northwesterly after about 03Z between 5 to 7
kts. High res guidance seems to suggest that the duration of the
northerly winds will be limited, and suggest a return to
south/southeasterly flow around 07Z.

.MARINE...Winds through the Strait of Juan de Fuca have eased below
small craft advisory thresholds early this morning, with no
additional headline level winds expected in the near term. High
pressure will build into the area by the later half of the week.

Combined seas are in the 6 to 7 feet range, but will be decreasing
to 3 to 5 feet by Thursday as high pressure settles in. The next
time frame that could see headlines in terms of seas and potentially
stronger southerlies would be late in the weekend as the next front
possibly materializes later on Sunday.
