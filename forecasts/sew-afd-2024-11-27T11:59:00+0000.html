Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Some light showers will linger at times, especially
in the Cascades and along the coast. A weak disturbance Friday
brings slightly higher shower chances along with opening the door
to cooler air into the region. A drier pattern emerges late in the
weekend through early next week as high pressure builds solidly
over the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Fairly widespread (but light)
showers continue to stream across the region as a cooler
west/northwest flow pattern becomes established over the region.
Otherwise, relatively light winds and abundant low level moisture
is supporting low stratus and some areas of fog. Expect these low
clouds to continue through around mid-morning. Expect flow to
take on an increasingly northerly component later today and into
the Thanksgiving holiday, which should bring some drier air moving
into the region and limiting the shower coverage even further.
With the building high pressure, expect some overnight/morning
clouds and cool overnight temperatures. A weak impulse moving
south along coastal B.C. could provide a focus for some additional
showers and some cooler air later on Friday, but again, no
significant impacts are expected.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/... Ensemble guidance
continues to suggest that the dominant feature will remain a
relatively high amplitude across the far eastern Pacific and
extending into the Pacific Northwest. Again, there is a non-
trivial subset of ensemble members that suggest a few passing
disturbances in the flow could round the ridge and at least bring
a few showers to portions of the area. As mentioned in the short
term section, the associated precipitation amounts are relatively
light so while there is some mention of showers through the
weekend, it`s likely that there won`t be a significant round of
precipitation and only perhaps a few light showers at times into
the weekend. Meanwhile, with a shift to a cooler and somewhat
drier flow aloft, expect to see the air mass to cool a bit late in
the week and this weekend. This could bring overnight
temperatures down into the 30s (lower 30s in the coolest spots,
mid 30s for most of the Puget Sound Region) for a few mornings
during this time period. For the start of next week, still strong
agreement in the ensemble guidance suggesting a ridge remaining in
place, though increasing disagreement in just how strong it is
and where the ridge axis remains. The next organized frontal
system may begin to approach the coastline by around midweek to
bring a return of more widespread precipitation chances. 12<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light and variable surface flow continues across western
Washington early this morning, with a mix of ceilings. Generally,
cigs are MVFR to VFR, but the usually lower spots such as OLM are
seeing LIFR cigs and a mix of fog and mist. Presently, radar shows
some showers moving down the Strait of Juan de Fuca, as well as some
in central Puget Sound moving to the ENE. Given the high pressure
and relatively higher cigs, fog and lower stratus is likely to
develop over the next several hours. The highest probabilities for
cigs less than 2000 feet through 15Z this morning, 50 to 70 percent,
lie within the majority of Puget Sound terminals. Areas north of
KPAE may struggle to break out any sooner than 19Z to 21Z today.

KSEA...MVFR with passing rain showers currently. These showers will
continue to move to the ENE throughout the next several hours. High-
resolution guidance is suggestive of ceilings coming down throughout
the rest of the morning hours, with a 60 to 80 percent chance of
cigs less than or equal to 2000 ft through 14Z. Some models are more
suggestive of keeping MVFR cigs around the terminal into the
afternoon, with the earliest suggestion of some higher cigs by 18Z-
19Z. That said, it feels more realistic to assume that given ample
surface moisture and light flow, anything that develops has the
capability to linger into the early afternoon. From a wind
perspective, expect south to southwesterly flow through much of the
TAF period, with hints of a return to northerly flow after 00Z at 3
to 5 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will continue to build over the coastal
waters today into tomorrow and remain in place through at least this
weekend. Some surface fog and lower stratus is possible this
morning, limiting visibilities over Puget Sound, particularly in
areas north of western Snohomish county through the San Juan
Islands. Winds remain light northwesterly across the coastal waters
through the week, becoming southerly this weekend. Seas 2 to 4 ft
through the week, increasing to 6 to 8 ft this weekend as long
period swell arrives to the area from a system over Alaska.
