Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
1025 PM EDT Tue Sep 12 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front and wave of low pressure moving along it will
approach overnight. Both will move across on Wednesday and then
pass east Wednesday night. High pressure will then build in on
Thursday, remain centered to the west through Friday, then start
to weaken over the weekend. At the same time, Hurricane Lee is
forecast to pass offshore to our east.

Hurricane Lee.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No significant changes; updated for current conditions.

In the upper levels, a southwesterly jet approaches from the
Great Lakes. In the mid levels, the ridge moves farther east and
height falls will portend the approach of a trough. The
positive vorticity advection will increase late tonight. At the
surface, a weak wave of low pressure approaches along a cold
front. The main parent low will be in Quebec.

Clouds increase in coverage going into the overnight period with
increasing chances of rain showers. Thunderstorm chances develop
as well going into early Wednesday morning with the increase in
low level instability.

Forecast lows are on the warmer side with a combination of NBM
and consensus of all model guidance used, ranging from the lower
60s to near 70.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
Showers can be expected with heavy rain at times across the
entire area Wednesday, lingering into Wednesday night for
Southeast CT and Eastern Long Island as a cold front with
associated wave of low pressure move across. See hydro section
for details regarding the potential for flooding and the flood
watch in effect for the region. There is a marginal threat for
severe weather as well discussed more below.

The mode of convection will likely be a solid to broken squall
line moving into western sections of the region early Wednesday
morning and across the remainder of the region for the remainder
of Wednesday morning into afternoon. This is from analysis of
CAMs. Wednesday morning through Wednesday afternoon is when
much of the rainfall is expected.

In the upper levels, the southwesterly jet intensifies farther
south with the right rear quad of this jet close to the forecast
region.

For the mid levels, the positive vorticity advection will continue
to increase from west to east. Mid level height falls will continue
as the trough continues to approach from the west. The weak wave of
surface low pressure along the cold front will gradually move east
within the region Wednesday.

On Wednesday night, the upper level jet streak narrows and
intensifies north of the region. The mid level height falls continue
as eventually the trough axis moves in by early Thursday. At the
surface, the front and low pressure wave will both exit east of Long
Island.

Layer precipitable waters increase to nearly 2 inches Wednesday
and with parallel flow evident from low to upper levels in the
forecast models, training of showers and thunderstorms can be
expected which will mean multiple rounds of showers and
thunderstorms. CAPE profiles from BUFKIT soundings are tall and
narrow but there will be more shear than what was present back
on Monday, allowing for thunderstorms to have more movement.
This will somewhat limit the extent of flooding but with intense
enough thunderstorms, flash flooding cannot be ruled out. The
higher shear will allow for potential for some strong to severe
thunderstorms as well. CAPE will be limited but more
directional wind shear in the low levels will increase helicity.
There will be the possibility for some thunderstorms to have
damaging winds as well as exhibit rotation so a brief tornado
will be possible as well.

Showers are most widespread across western sections of the
region including NE NJ, NYC, Lower Hudson Valley, Western Long
Island and SW CT Wednesday morning into early Wednesday
afternoon. Showers are most widespread across eastern sections
of the region with the rest of Southern CT and Eastern Long
Island Wednesday morning through early Wednesday evening. There
is potential for showers and thunderstorms to linger for a
longer period of time for these eastern sections Wednesday
night.

Forecast highs Wednesday are on the cooler side and were chosen
from the consensus of all model guidance, only ranging from the
low to mid 70s. Expecting temperatures to be a little cooler
with the more northerly flow Wednesday night with a blend of
MAV, MET and NBM used for lows, ranging from the low 50s to low
60s.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
On Thu showers should be coming to an end out east early AM,
otherwise looking at a mostly sunny day with NW flow ushering a
drier air mass, with dewpoints lowering to the 40s/lower 50s.

For Fri, high clouds in advance of Lee will be on the increase,
otherwise temps/dewpoints look similar to those for Thu. Northerly
winds between inland high pressure and Lee will also be on the
increase to 15G25mph as the pressure gradient increases between
inland high pressure and the outer circulation of Lee.

Strongest winds associated with Lee should arrive Fri night and
continue into Sat, with winds backing NW on Sat as the hurricane
passes well east. The hurricane`s wind field will be expanding in
size as it moves northward, and winds especially across coastal SE
CT and ern Long Island could become strong, sustained 25-30 mph with
gusts up to 40 mph possible. Can`t rule out tropical storm force
winds in those areas right near the shoreline in areas with a good
NW-N exposure.

NBM PoP still clips ern CT/Long Island on the periphery of Lee, with
only light rainfall amts expected at most.

WAA starts early next week, with slight chance for showers and
possibly a tstm Mon/Tue.

.AVIATION /03Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front approaches overnight and moves across the
terminals Wednesday afternoon into Wednesday night.

VFR with showers developing late. There is a chance of
thunderstorms, late tonight into Wednesday morning, with
briefly heavy rain and gusty winds; conditions may lower to
MVFR. Timing of the onset of showers and thunderstorms remains
consistent from earlier thinking, however, possible that start
time is an hour later. Showers and thunderstorms will be
affecting the morning push. Lower confidence for thunder after
14Z/15Z, and storms may be more isolated, however, will continue
with the PROB30s. Showers end mid to late afternoon west, and
not til after 00Z Thursday east.

Light southerly flow continues through the overnight, with
light and variable winds outside of the NYC metro terminals.
Winds gradually become SW ahead of the front, and then W to NW
behind the front. Winds remain rather light with the passage of
the front, and gusts are not expected.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Amendments will be needed for timing of showers/thunderstorms,
and for lowering conditions. High confidence that showers and
thunderstorms occur, and moderate confidence with timing.


OUTLOOK FOR 00Z THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...

Wednesday night: VFR at the NYC terminals and west, showers,
with MVFR possible east, ending by late evening, 02Z, becoming
VFR.

Thursday - Friday: VFR. Northerly wind gusts around 15 to 20 kt
Thursday night through Friday night.

Saturday: Mainly VFR. NW wind gusts around 20 to 25 kt.

Sunday: VFR. West winds with gusts 15-20kt.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Ocean seas are building, with long period swells being
observed, but lagging behind previous forecast slightly, with
5-footers now expected to hold off until daybreak Wed. Adjusted
SCA start time accordingly.

SCA runs until 6 AM Thursday for all ocean zones. Non-ocean
waters remain below SCA threshold through Wednesday night.

Ocean seas should continue to build on Thu, reaching 5-8 ft by
late day Thu, 8-12 ft by daybreak Fri, and peaking at 9-14 ft
Fri afternoon/evening. Seas will then actually start to slowly
decrease Fri night into Sat as strong offshore flow counteracts
incoming swell, down to 8-12 ft by daybreak Sat, 6-8 ft Sat
evening, then below 5 ft by Sunday afternoon.

Attm think sustained N-NW winds or frequent gusts from Lee could
peak at tropical storm force (35-40 kt) Fri night into Sat,
mainly on the ern ocean waters/sound. Elsewhere, SCA cond likely
from Fri into Sat, with a few gusts up to 35 kt possible Fri
night/Sat AM.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...
Around 1 inch of rain is forecast for most locations from late
tonight through Wednesday evening with locally higher amounts
expected. The upper limit for these locally higher rainfall
amounts would be 2 to 3 inches locally.

There is a chance for flash flooding with any areas receiving
multiple rounds of showers and thunderstorms with heavy rain
especially in low lying, poor drainage and urban areas. A flood
watch is in effect for NE NJ, NYC, Lower Hudson Valley, Nassau
NY, and Fairfield CT from 4AM until 6PM Wednesday and a flood
watch is in effect for New Haven CT, Middlesex CT, and New
London CT as well as Suffolk NY from 8AM Wednesday until 2AM
Thursday.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
A high surf advisory has been issued for the Nassau/Suffolk
beaches for Wed, and for all the ocean beaches for Thu, as surf
heights increase to 6-8 ft on Wed and 7-10 ft on Thu. Hazardous
surf should continue into Sat, and may peak between 10-14 ft on
Fri, similar to the fcst wave heights at the offshore buoys. In
combination with higher water levels due to the new moon which
occurs on Thu, beach erosion may also become a problem on
Friday.

A high rip current risk statement has been issued for Wed thru
Fri, and will likely have to be extended into at least Sat based
on the current fcst track and intensity of Hurricane Lee.
