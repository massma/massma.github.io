Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
758 PM EDT Sat Jun 8 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure slides south of the area tonight. A cold front is
expected to move through on Sunday. A series of weak cold
fronts or troughs will move across the area Monday and Tuesday,
followed by high pressure building in for the middle of the
week. A frontal system may impact the area for the end of the
week.

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SUNDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak surface ridge will pass through the area tonight ahead
of an approaching cold front. Mid and high level clouds will
increase, mainly after midnight. Showers will develop toward
daybreak ahead of the shortwave driving the front east. Otherwise,
it should remain dry for much of the night with lows in the
upper 50s to low 60s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak cold front will move across during the late morning into
early afternoon hours along with a chance of showers. At this
time instability is limited and most forcing looks to stay north
of the CWA. Also, the timing of the frontal passage will limit
the chances of thunderstorms across the area.

Winds will be a bit gusty out of the SW ahead of the front and
then from the WNW behind it in the afternoon. Dry conditions
expected behind the front and into Sunday night.

Temperatures on Sunday will be in the upper 70s to low 80s with lows
in the upper 50s to low 60s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
**Key Points**

*Warming trend mid to late week, with increasing chances of above
normal temperatures.

*Mainly dry conditions through the period.

*A frontal system may impact the area with showers and
 thunderstorms Friday into next weekend.

An anomalously strong upper trough over eastern Canada and the
Northeast (2-3SD) will slowly lift out to start the week, but
before doing so one last piece of shortwave energy closes off
at the base of the trough Monday night into Tuesday. There are
some small differences between the global models in the
placement of the feature, but regardless of the solutions, the
forecast is mainly dry with the exception of a low chance of
showers across some of the interior Monday afternoon into early
evening. Thereafter, shortwave ridging aloft briefly builds
across the area midweek in tandem with surface high pressure.
While the upper flow flattens out with a fast flow from the
Northern Plains into the Northeast, this is brief as the upper
trough reestablishes itself by next weekend. The associated
frontal system brings increasing chances for convection, mainly
Friday into Friday night. Global models beyond this time point
toward significant height rises for the following week with the
potential for very warm conditions.

As for temperatures, generally stayed close to the NBM. While
the deterministic highs continue to be in the 10th-25th
percentile, not convinced with the thermal profiles to deviate
too much. This results in a gradual warming trend from the
middle to end of the week. Temperatures at the onset are close
to normal.

.AVIATION /00Z SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front approaches from the west tonight and passes across
the terminals late Sunday morning into early Sunday afternoon.

Mainly VFR through the TAF period. Showers may accompany the cold
front 13z-17z for NYC and Lower Hudson Valley terminals and
14-18z for Long Island and southern CT terminals. Conditions
may briefly drop to MVFR in the showers.

WNW winds will weaken this evening after sunset. A few gusts could
linger at 00z, but should quickly end by 01z. Wind will shift to the
SW through 04z, then become S early Sunday morning. S winds
increase after day break before quickly shifting to the W with
the cold front passage. Gusts 20-25 kt are expected Sunday
afternoon, but should begin subsiding in the evening.

  NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Gusts 20-25 kt possible through 01z.

Timing of wind shifts in the TAF may be off by 1-3 hours.

OUTLOOK FOR 00Z MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...

Sunday Night-Thursday: Mainly VFR.

.MARINE...
Conditions are expected to remain below SCA levels through
midweek. As strengthening southerly Thursday into Friday could
produce marginal SCA conditions.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
No hydrologic impacts are expected through the end of next week.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
For the Atlantic ocean beaches, expect a moderate rip current risk
on Sunday, but lowering to low on Monday. A southerly swell of
3-4ft@7s on Sunday will gradually diminish Sunday night into Monday.
A moderate risk may linger into the morning hours on Monday for
SE Suffolk beaches.
