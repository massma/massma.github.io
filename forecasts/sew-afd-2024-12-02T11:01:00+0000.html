Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
301 AM PST Mon Dec 2 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will continue to amplify into western
Washington into early this week, allowing for dry conditions and
periods of morning fog and low stratus. The upper ridge will weaken
towards the middle of next week as the next storm system approaches,
bringing in the next chance for widespread precipitation across the
region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>As of 2 AM PST, satellite
shows widespread fog expanding this morning across the Puget Sound
and surrounding lowlands, Chehalis Valley towards Grays Harbor, and
over the Hood Canal and through the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
Locally dense fog has limited visibilities in some areas to a
quarter mile or less, and low temperatures near freezing has
produced pockets of freezing fog. A Dense Fog Advisory has been
issued for much of the lowlands for pockets of greatly reduced
visibility through the late morning. With high pressure firmly in
place, expect a foggy commute and for conditions to slowly
improve into the late morning and early afternoon.

High pressure will continue to build northward into western
Washington throughout the first half of this week, maintaining dry
conditions and mostly sunny skies with near- normal temperatures.
Fog and low stratus will continue to redevelop each morning and
linger into the early afternoon hours, with some areas seeing dense
or freezing fog. There will continue to be little change to the
overall weather pattern day- to-day through Wednesday, with highs in
the upper 40s to lower 50s and lows near freezing across the
lowlands.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...A pattern change is on
track for the second half of this week as the upper ridge weakens
and troughing develops over the region. A disturbance will override
the ridge on Thursday, set to bring a quick shot of rain to the
region with snow levels near 7000 ft. A warm front will lift across
western Washington on Friday, bringing in another round of
widespread rainfall and warmer air that will bring temperatures into
the 50s across much of the lowlands. A cold front will follow close
behind on Saturday, maintaining chances for precipitation and
bringing snow levels down to 3000-4000 ft.
Ensembles favor a slightly drier solution for Sunday with weak
ridging building into the region. Rivers will see rises over the
weekend with the incoming precipitation, but flooding is not
expected.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure aloft remains in place over the region
today with light west to southwest flow aloft. The low level flow
remains weakly offshore. Widespread IFR/LIFR in fog and low clouds
with areas of surface visibilities 1SM or less across the interior
lowlands will persist through the morning before eroding partially
this afternoon. Widespread IFR/LIFR conditions will return tonight.

KSEA...LIFR with surface vsbys 1/2SM or less will persist through
18Z before lifting and scattering out toward 20Z. LIFR in fog and
low clouds will return near or after 06Z tonight. Surface winds
light and variable this morning become light N/NE this afternoon and
evening.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure at the surface and aloft will remain in
control through midweek. This will lead to abundant night and
morning fog with visibilities below 1 mile at times...especially
across the inland waters. The ridge will break down late in the week
with the first of a series of frontal systems arriving on Thursday.
Stronger systems will follow Friday and again on Saturday with
headlines expected for much of the waters. Seas will climb back over
over 10 feet across portions of the coastal waters by the weekend.
