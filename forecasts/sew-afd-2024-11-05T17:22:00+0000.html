Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
922 AM PST Tue Nov 5 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mountain snow showers will taper off early this
morning. High pressure building today into Wednesday will allow
for a period of dry and cooler conditions. A return to an active
pattern is then expected beginning Friday through early next week
with several systems moving through the area with additional rain,
mountain snow, and wind.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Still monitoring post-frontal convergence zone showers
and snow showers east of I-5 between I-90 and US-2. Some of the
radar returns have been heavy enough to keep the inherited winter
storm warning and advisory going through 10 am. Model guidance
shows the showers dissipating shortly after the current
expiration time. Otherwise remaining areas will see more clouds
than sun and cooler temperatures today.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Satellite imagery early
this morning shows cirrus moving in from the northwest over a
building upper level ridge and behind a departing shortwave trough.
Satellite and radar imagery also shows continuing light rain/snow
showers over the central Cascades due to strong moist onshore flow.
Snow has largely ended through the North Cascades, thus will cancel
the Winter Storm Warning this morning. Elsewhere, snow showers will
being to taper off later this morning, as will the Winter Storm
Warning north-central Cascades and the Winter Weather Advisory for
the south-central Cascades. The upper level ridge and associated
surface high pressure will build today and into Wednesday, allowing
for a period of drier and cooler weather, with high temperatures in
the low 50s and low temperatures in the low to mid 30s. A weak warm
front offshore that skirts by to the northwest keeps low chances for
light rain over the northwest coast, otherwise most of western
Washington will see decreasing clouds and even some sunshine
Wednesday and early Thursday. Increasing clouds on Thursday will
signal the return of more unsettled weather going into late week.
Thursday will be a bit warmer, with highs in the mid to upper 50s
and lows in the 40s as the low-level winds turn more offshore.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...The upper level ridge over
the region breaks down, allowing for a series of upper-level troughs
to move through the area. The exact evolution of the pattern is a
bit uncertain as the deterministic model solutions vary greatly in
terms of the strength, evolution, and timing of each system. In
general, chances for rain persist through the long-term period. A
weakening front looks to move through late Friday into Saturday,
with a stronger system Sunday into Monday that will likely have
better upper-level support. Snow levels will be high (above 6000 ft)
with the first system, lowering Saturday into Sunday, and the second
system will bring another round of substantial mountain snow. Winds
will also be breezy throughout this period. Temperatures look to be
fairly static, with highs in the low 50s with lows in the 40s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow aloft shifting more northerly as
upper level ridging shifts eastward, even though the ridge axis
remains off the coast. Light and variable surface winds in place for
most terminals this morning although there are some exceptions. SEA
has SE winds running 4-8 kts, PAE is a little bit ahead of the game
with winds already shifted to the north with speeds akin to SEA and
CLM is seeing westerlies running 8-12 kts. Most terminals, save for
CLM and HQM, will turn northerly early this afternoon and remain
there through tonight. CLM and HQM will remain westerly.

VFR conditions area-wide this morning and will remain that way for
the majority of the TAF period. Models are starting to suggest some
low clouds developing overnight, especially for locations prone to
lower cigs...which may see conditions devolve to MVFR to IFR around
12Z Wednesday. Forecast issue of the day will be trying to determine
whether or not this moist lower layer will extend further east to
terminals along the east side of the Sound. At this time, models are
leaning away from this prospect, but will continue to monitor.

KSEA...VFR conditions in place and will remain for most, if not all,
the TAF period. That said, mid to high level clouds will be over the
terminal throughout the day with amount/coverage varying from time
to time. S/SE winds this morning 4-8 kts turning northerly this
afternoon around 23Z with speeds remaining about the same.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Small craft advisories remain in place across the
coastal waters and west entrance today as seas remain hazardous and
post-frontal westerlies gradually ease. Winds in the Strait still
meeting low end SCA criteria at Race Rock and gusts at Smith Island,
so they are trending in the right direction. Thus will allow
headlines for Central and Eastern Strait to expire on time. Surface
ridging over the coastal and offshore waters will shift inland
tonight with light offshore flow developing. A warm front will brush
the coastal waters later today into tonight. High pressure will
remain over the waters Wednesday and Thursday. A weakening front
will arrive on Friday before a stronger system sweeps across the
waters Friday night into Saturday.

Double digit seas will gradually drop below 10 feet by tonight and
remain there through much of the week ahead before building again
this weekend as a series of frontal systems reach the waters.  27/18<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No river flooding is expected in the next 7 days.
The systems this weekend into early next week will need to be
monitored with rises on area rivers forecast, though relatively
lower snow levels should help limit the overall flood potential.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
