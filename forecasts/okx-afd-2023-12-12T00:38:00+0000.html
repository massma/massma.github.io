.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will build in from the southwest through Tuesday,
then weaken Tuesday night. A cold front will approach late
Tuesday night and pass through early Wednesday, followed by
strong high pressure building from the west from later Wednesday
into Friday. The high will weaken on Friday, allowing a weak
cold front to pass through from the north early Saturday, with
strong high pressure returning for the weekend. Unsettled
weather may make a return on Monday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM TUESDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>In the wake of deepening low pressure that has pulled north into
SE Canada, high pressure has begun to build in from the south
and west. The pressure gradient remains tight between the two
systems, with still some gusts 30-35 mph in the metro area and
across Long Island. Winds should gradually diminish tonight, and
bands of stratocu should also dissipate, with mostly clear skies
in most places overnight, and low temps largely below freezing.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...
A much quieter regime sets up for the bulk of the remainder of
the week as high pressure largely dominates.

Brief zonal flow aloft in the wake of the departing trough on
Tuesday will give way to another northern stream trough, which
will sends a dry cold front through the area early Wednesday
morning. Ahead of it, a rather tranquil day is on tap. With
little moisture in the column, more sun than clouds can be
expected as afternoon highs in the low to mid 40s, or just a
couple of degrees below normal for the time of year. The relaxed
pressure gradient will allow much lighter winds than on Monday,
with a modest SW flow prevailing. Temperatures overnight fall
back into the 20s across the interior, and the 30s along the
coast.

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
A deep longwave upper trough swinging across ern Canada will
send a cold front through early Wed. CAA in its wake should
maintain temps a few degrees below normal into Thu night as
strong high pressure builds across.

After the upper trough passes, building heights aloft will lead
to a quick warming trend for Fri into early next week. A weak,
dry frontal boundary may sink through from the N early Sat,
accompanied by a band of low to mid level clouds at most but no
appreciable change in temps for the weekend, which should remain
dry as another strong sfc high builds across.

Evolution of a low pressure system to the south early next week
is very uncertain per divergent model solutions, with the
ECMWF keeping the low suppressed well to the south via a more
amplified nrn stream trough while the GFS brings the sys slowly
up the coastal plain. Model guidance during that time at least
has better agreement on a moistening low level maritime flow
bringing clouds into the area Sunday night-Mon, also low chance
PoP mainly for Long Island and SE CT.

.AVIATION /00Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure builds in during the TAF period.

VFR. WNW diminishing early this evening to mostly 20-25 kt.
Frequent gusts then drop off by midnight. They may become more
occasional before ending. Winds shift W late tonight, then
become SW around 10 kt with possible occasional gusts to 20 kt
Tue afternoon.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...
Gusts may become more occasional before ending around 04Z.

Winds are expected to average around 310 magnetic through this
evening, however, medium confidence that winds will tend to
favor north/right of 310 magnetic through 03Z-05Z, then
south/left of it thereafter for all but KEWR, which should more
likely prevail south of 310 magnetic.

OUTLOOK FOR 00Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

Tuesday Night: VFR. SW winds G15-20kt possible in the
afternoon.

Wednesday: VFR. NW winds G20-25kt in the afternoon.

Thursday through Saturday: VFR.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Extended the Gale Warning on all waters until 10 PM with still
some 35-40 kt gusts on the ocean waters, and replaced it with
SCA on the remaining waters. Winds should gradually diminish
tonight from west to east tonight, then hazardous ocean seas
should continue into Tue-Tue night, with WSW flow also gusting
up to 25 kt on the ocean Tue night.

SCA cond on the ocean and perhaps on some of the near shore
waters surrounding Long Island on Wed, with W flow gusting up
to 25-30 kt and ocean seas 5-6 ft, should expand to all waters
late day Wed into Wed night as winds shift NW and cold air
advection increases. These conditions should last into Thu AM on
the ocean and the eastern Sound/bays.

As strong high pressure building in from the west weakens Thu
night-Fri night and a secondary cold front passes off the New
England coast, the pressure gradient should increase enough to
allow a return of minimal SCA cond to the ocean waters, with NW
winds gusting up to 25 kt and seas possibly briefly building to
5 ft Fri AM.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
