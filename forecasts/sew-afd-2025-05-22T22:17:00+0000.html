Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
317 PM PDT Thu May 22 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Warmer and drier conditions develop across Western
Washington through the end of the week as high pressure builds
over the region. A approaching front may bring some showers in
the mountains Monday and a slight pause on warmer temperatures,
but dry and warm conditions return early next week. Another
disturbance approaches again around the middle of next week with
lower confidence in the pattern by this time.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Temperatures have
warmed into the 60s for much of the interior already this
afternoon under mostly sunny skies across much of the region,
while some banks of clouds remain along the mountains and
extending into the lowlands of Lewis County. With zonal flow in
place over the region and light low-level flow, not seeing much
change over the next 24 hours or so. Expect another day with
primarily sunny skies and temperatures again near normal on
Friday. It`s worth noting that some spots with clear skies and
light wind could drop into the upper 30s in the typically colder
spots, while most of the area will bottom out in the 40s.
Looking ahead to Saturday, the heights will rise over the region
in response to the upper low dropping from the Gulf of Alaska.
This will bring warming across the region with afternoon
temperatures into the 70s for the interior.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...The upper ridge remains
in place this weekend, with Sunday likely the warmest day for
most Expect temperatures to reach well into the 70s and a few of
the warmest spots could even approach 80. With the offshore
trough in place and the ridge axis shifting east, there is some
potential for increasing southwesterly flow aloft to perhaps
bring a focus for some convection near the Cascades late Sunday
or early Monday. While the chances for thunderstorms remains
somewhat low (around 10%) at this time, those with outdoor plans
in the Cascades over the holiday weekend will want to maintain
aware of this potential. With the passing disturbance on Monday,
expect temperatures to run a few degrees cooler with increasing
clouds and a cooler air mass.

Another round of higher heights on Tuesday/Wednesday with
another ridge building over the area will bring another round of
temperatures will into the 70s for the interior as southerly
flow aloft settles over the region. Confidence in the details of
the forecast break down around midweek with ensemble guidance
split between maintaining the high pressure over the region and
warmer temperatures to persist and allowing the next front to
push through the Pacific Northwest and bring slightly cooler,
cloudier conditions with a return of rain chances.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Flow westerly aloft as the upper-level pattern
trends more zonal. For tonight, mostly VFR is in store for
terminals but isolated MVFR cigs are possible. A 30-50% chance
of cigs below 3,000 ft exists for KHQM, KPWT, and KPAE overnight
into Friday morning. Onshore flow keeping surface winds at a
westerly component this afternoon between 5-10 kt but winds are
to decrease in magnitude tonight. More widespread VFR expected
on Friday.

KSEA...VFR conditions expected through the TAF period. Winds WNW 5-
10 kt this afternoon before becoming lighter and variable overnight.
Cloud coverage will vary throughout the period but again, cigs aren`t
expected to be less than 5,000 ft.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will maintain into the weekend. A weak
disturbance is still on track to dissipate before making it to the
coastal waters on Friday. As a result, impacts are unlikely. What
we`ll have to watch is diurnal westerlies through the Strait of Juan
de Fuca. For tonight, HREF guidance has a 60-80% chance of SCA gusts
(21-25 kt) occuring over the central/east strait. This is a marginal
situation as gusts appear to be infrequent but we`ll continue to
monitor the threat this afternoon-early evening.

The next front is currently forecast to arrive on Monday, with high
pressure remaining stubborn over the coastal waters shortly
afterwards. High pressure may trend into Wednesday as well but of
lesser strength.

Seas 3-5 ft tonight into Friday. A slight uptick in seas is expected
again Saturday night into Sunday, with seas building towards 5-7 ft.
Seas then look to persist within this range through the early part
of next week.
