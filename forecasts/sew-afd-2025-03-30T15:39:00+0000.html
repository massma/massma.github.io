Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
839 AM PDT Sun Mar 30 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Weak high pressure will provide drier and mild
conditions today for most areas. Another disturbance arrives
tonight with additional chances for showers and a return to
cooler conditions through the middle of the week. Drier and
warmer conditions then return as high pressure rebuilds into
Western Washington toward the end of the week.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No changes made to the
forecast this morning. The previous discussion can be found below
along with updated aviation and marine sections:

High level clouds are already spreading over the region early
this morning ahead of the next system offshore. The low level flow
will turn increasingly offshore today and this will aid in
boosting temperatures...particularly across the interior
lowlands...where lower 60s are expected this afternoon. Shower
activity should hold off along the coast until late this afternoon
then gradually spread inland tonight. The air mass will start off
rather dry in the low levels...and this along with the showery
nature looks to limit QPF. Scattered showers will continue into
Monday across Western Washington as the upper level low wobbles
just offshore. The upper low is expected to move onshore over
Oregon on Tuesday taking most shower activity with it...leaving
much of Western Washington more dry than wet with near seasonal
temperatures.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Model agreement is a
little better in the long term, though certainly not optimal.
Western Washington will remain on the back side of broad upper
troughing over the Western U.S. Wednesday into Thursday with
another disturbance digging southward over the western Canadian
provinces. This keeps a chance of showers in the forecast, but
it`s not a particularly wet pattern. Ensemble clusters are showing
better agreement toward the end of the week with some high
amplitude upper ridging building into British Columbia. There`s
still some uncertainty with the strength of the ridge, but 500
millibar heights in the lower to mid 570s dam and weak low level
offshore flow could boost much of the area into the mid to upper
60s by Saturday with plenty of sunshine. Looks like I`ll need to
clean up the barbecue and tune up the bike. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southerly flow will continue aloft throughout the
period as a trough meanders offshore. Conditions are mostly VFR
for the majority of the area terminals this morning, except for
KOLM, KCLM, and KPAE in patchy fog. Satellite shows high clouds
streaming northward over the area this morning. Expect fog to
dissipate by the late morning hours as N/NE winds start to pick up.
VFR conditions are then expected for much of the afternoon and
evening, though the next round of rain will begin to move up from
the south between 00-03z Monday and could bring with it instances
of MVFR cigs/vis. A mix of VFR and MVFR is expected overnight
Sunday into early Monday. Easterly wind gusts up to 20-25 kt are
favored today for some terminals such as KHQM.

KSEA...VFR conditions expected to persist through much of the
TAF period, however a brief window of MVFR cigs exists this evening
(likely between 00-03z) as the next round of rain moves into the
terminal. However, probabilities for the occurrence remain low
(around 20%), so the most likely forecast suggests VFR. Northerly
winds 7-12 kt will switch and become more easterly between 18-20z,
with gusts to 25 kt possible at times. Winds will transition to
the SE and persist at 5-10 kt tonight before becoming light early
Monday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Offshore flow will increase this morning as a 990 mb
surface low develops well offshore. With it, breezy easterly winds
through the strait are favored as a SCA remains in effect for the
northern coastal water zones. Some isolated SCA gusts are possible
in the West Strait during this time. A southerly wind switch
during this afternoon-evening will allow for SCA winds to expand
to the remainder of the coastal water zones through Monday.
Additional headlines may need to be expanded to some inland water
zones such as East Strait, Admiralty Inlet, etc. on Monday as
well. The pattern will remain active into Tuesday but uncertainty
exists midweek onward. Seas 4 to 6 ft today will increase to 7 to
9 ft on Monday and may briefly build to above 10 ft on Monday
night.

.HYDROLOGY...The Skokomish River will remain in action stage into
midweek, but overall QPF through the week ahead does not look
sufficient to produce any flood concerns there or along any other
rivers across the region through the upcoming week. 27
