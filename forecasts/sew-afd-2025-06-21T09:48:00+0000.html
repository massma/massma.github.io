.SYNOPSIS...

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surge of moisture will wrap
around an upper level low centered over eastern WA/OR and bring a
quick round of stratiform rain across western Washington this
morning. An additional quarter to half an inch remains possible
through this afternoon, with locally higher amounts in the
mountains. Snow levels around 5000-5500 ft this morning will allow
for an inch or two of new snow at the higher elevation peaks and at
Paradise. Rain will taper off Saturday night, though a few showers
may linger over the mountains Saturday night into Sunday. Elsewhere,
conditions dry out Sunday and on Monday as high pressure begins to
reestablish itself over the region.

High temperatures today will remain in the 60s but the warming trend
begins Sunday with highs a few degrees on either side of 70.
Monday`s highs should reach the mid to upper 70s. Lows will remain
in the mid 40s to low 50s.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Tuesday remains on track to be
the warmest day of the next seven with highs reaching the low to mid
80s. In the upper levels, flow is split behind the departing upper
level low but we will be under the influence of a ridge that extends
north into British Columbia. A couple of weak shortwave troughs look
to push quickly through the area with the main impact being cooler
temperatures, back into the 70s, cloudy skies, and slight chances
for light rain showers through Friday. 62<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper low will continue to progress eastwards into
the interior Northwest into Saturday for increasing northerly flow
aloft. VFR/MVFR cigs early this morning with increasing stratiform
rain sliding southwards across Western Washington. Widespread MVFR
cigs expected generally after 10-12z through the early afternoon for
most sites, with areas of IFR as well, mainly along the coast, and
within areas of heavier precipitation. In addition, brief vsby
reductions are possible towards 3-5 SM in rainfall through this
morning. Some improvements towards VFR by late Saturday afternoon
into Saturday evening with drier conditions. S/SW surface winds.

KSEA...VFR cigs early this morning with abundant mid clouds. Rain
will increase this morning (mainly around 10-12z) with rain at times
through the morning. Cigs will lower to MVFR also between 10-12z. A
brief period of IFR cigs cannot be ruled out either this morning.
Vsbys may also briefly lower towards 4-6 SM in the rain. Cigs are
expected to remain MVFR into the afternoon, before some improvements
to VFR generally around 22 Sat to 00z Sun. S/SW surface winds. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weather system will continue to progress east of the
region on Saturday. High pressure will build over the waters on
Sunday. Elevated northwest winds will continue over the Coastal
Waters through this afternoon, before dissipating Saturday night. A
Small Craft Advisory remains in effect for the outer Coastal Waters
due to a combination of winds and seas through the afternoon. An
onshore flow pattern will then continue next week, resulting in
periods of increased west winds through the Strait of Juan de Fuca,
particularly Sunday evening, and again Tuesday evening.

Seas will build to 10 to 11 feet for the outer Coastal Waters this
morning, before subsiding below 10 feet Saturday evening. In
addition, the period will only be 8 to 9 seconds through Saturday,
resulting in choppy seas for the outer Coastal Waters. Seas will
further subside to 4 to 6 feet Sunday into Monday. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
