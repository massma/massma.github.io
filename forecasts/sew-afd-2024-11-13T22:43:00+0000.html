Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
243 PM PST Wed Nov 13 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showery and cool conditions will persist through
Thursday before an upper ridge brings a short break in the active
weather to the area on Friday. Cool and unsettled conditions
return over the weekend and persist into early next week as
another system moves into western Washington.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A deep upper level trough
stemming from the Gulf of Alaska will continue to spread shower
activity inland across western Washington today, with periods of
breezy winds and embedded convection along the coast. Instability
from the offshore low has also generated locally heavy rainfall in
stronger showers that have developed, with rain rates approaching an
inch to an inch and a half per hour. As cooler air continues to move
onshore, snow levels will continue to lower to 4000 ft by later this
evening. As the storm system slowly shifts eastward, showers will
continue across the region overnight and will slowly decrease in
coverage throughout the day Thursday. The bulk of the remaining
moisture with this storm system is on track to fall over the Olympic
Peninsula and North Cascades, where potential remains for 1 to 3
additional inches of liquid. The lowlands are on track to see
rainfall totals between now and Thursday of half an inch to an inch.
Higher elevations of the North Cascades are still on track to see
significant snowfall, while the higher peaks elsewhere will see a
few inches of additional snow accumulation.

The upper trough axis will shift across the Pacific Northwest late
Thursday into Friday, allowing for conditions to mostly dry out.
High resolution model guidance suggests some isolated light shower
activity could linger throughout the day on Friday under moist north
to northwest flow aloft. Temperatures are on track to top out in the
upper 40s across the lowlands on Friday, bringing snow levels down
to roughly 2500 ft. With cold road temperatures, the Cascade Passes
could see light snow accumulations on Friday from any showers that
develop over the mountains.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...The region will see
little relief from wet conditions, with another storm system moving
in on Saturday. Widespread precipitation and breezy winds will once
again move into western Washington by Saturday afternoon, with
ensembles favoring unsettled conditions to continue through
Thursday. Snow levels will rise above 4500-5000 ft on Saturday as
tropical moisture moves in, then fall to 2000 ft by Monday morning
with continued shower activity. The Cascade Passes will likely see
accumulating snowfall towards the end of the weekend, though exact
amounts are uncertain at this time.
Precipitation is favored to continue into Tuesday, with a low (10%
to 15%) probability of a rain snow mix across the lowlands early
Tuesday morning.

Ensemble cluster analysis shows a strong signal for high pressure
building over the western US by mid-week next week, which would
usher in dry and warmer conditions. However, lots of uncertainty
still remains in the timing and intensity of the high pressure if it
does develop. Long range climate models favor a shift to above-
normal temperatures by the end of next week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough axis continues to drive a strong
cold front, and trailing surface trough through Washington today.
Cool air aloft has maintained the unstable air mass this afternoon
with these frontal boundaries. Areas of moderate to at times heavy
precipitation continues over a majority of the terminals this
afternoon. The strongest showers (with isolated thunderstorms) have
been over the coastal waters and along the coastline. Some of these
storms have been strong enough to produce hail, and wind gusts up to
45 kt (as observed at KHQM). Heavy rain over terminals has been
enough to drop visibilities down to IFR at times. The storm threat
will wind down over the coastal waters.

High resolution guidance shows isolated storms continuing over the
coastal waters through this evening (with the storm threat
diminishing through the afternoon/evening). Guidance also shows more
widespread moderate to heavy showers moving over major Puget Sound
terminals this afternoon (after 21Z). The thunder threat is
significantly lower inland, but cannot rule out heavy rain over the
terminals (reducing visibilities), and gusty winds from any outflow
that takes place. Outside of stronger showers/storms, winds will be
sustained out of the southwest at 10-15 kt (gusting to 25 kt)
through tonight, reducing to 10 kt Thursday morning. Ceilings will
continue to remain MVFR/VFR through the afternoon, but will become
widespread MVFR tonight into a majority of Thursday.

KSEA...VFR ceilings continue this afternoon with light/moderate
showers in the vicinity of the terminal. Guidance shows more
widespread showers moving over the terminal between 21-00Z
(potentially reducing visibilities down to IFR, as well as producing
gusty winds). Outside of the stronger showers, the winds will remain
out of the south at 8 to 12 kt gusting to 20 to 25 kt through
tonight (reducing further to 10 kt Thursday). Ceilings will drop to
MVFR later Wednesday night into a majority of Thursday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front and trailing surface trough continue to pass
through the region today. Gusty non-thunderstorm winds have
continued today, and are expected to diminish this evening over the
interior waters. Isolated showers and thunderstorms will continue
over the coastal waters through the afternoon and evening (with the
thunder threat diminishing Thursday morning. There has been enough
shear to produce rotation in several of the storms over the coastal
waters, and there will be a risk of waterspouts with the strongest
storms through the afternoon. Otherwise, hail, gusty winds, and
lightning will be possible with activity ahead of the frontal
boundary.

Behind the frontal boundary, ridging will rebuild offshore Thursday.
Winds will diminish tonight into Thursday morning. Next chance of
gusty winds will be with another system Saturday into early next
week. Hazardous seas of 16 to 20 feet will begin to subside later
today, but will remain at or above 10 feet into early Friday. A
return of double digit seas is expected later this weekend as
another larger swell train arrives behind the weekend frontal
system.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front is currently passing over western
Washington this afternoon. Showers with localized heavy rain has
been observed ahead of the front, which will continue for the next
few hours this afternoon. These showers should have limited
additional effects on area rivers.

Rivers will continue to rise tonight, particularly through the
Olympic basin and North Cascades, where the heaviest rainfall has
been observed. Rivers will crest tonight into early tomorrow before
beginning to fall. The Skokomish River, which is currently at
moderate flood stage, will crest tonight and is expected to fall
below flood stage Thursday night. The Bogachiel river has crested
well below flood stage.

Currently no additional river flooding is forecast at this time.
Another system will move through the area this weekend. Snow levels
will fluctuate, ranging from 2000 to 4000 ft throughout the weekend.
The amount of flooding will depend on temperatures and the QPF
forecast as it evolves through the week, which will continue to be
monitored.
