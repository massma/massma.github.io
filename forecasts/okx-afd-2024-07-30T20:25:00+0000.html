Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
425 PM EDT Tue Jul 30 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak cold front or surface trough approaches from the west
tonight into Wednesday, passing through during the evening
hours Wednesday. A series of weak fronts then move through the
area Thursday through Monday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Shortwave ridging between an upper low over eastern Canada and
an upper trough over the Ohio Valley will largely keep the area
quiet this evening. There were a few cells breaking out in eastern
PA. Latest HRRR shows the possibility of something isolated this
evening north and west as the cap weakens. The main activity over
central PA will be the primary focus, which lifts NE through this
evening in conjunction with the aforementioned upper trough. CAMs
generally weaken this convection due to the loss of daytime
instability, bringing it into western portions of the area
around or shortly after midnight. By that time, there is very
little CAPE, so expecting mainly showers with a few thunderstorms.
The associated upper trough does provide some lift, enough to
think that whatever convection makes it here may work east
across coastal areas into Wednesday morning. There is no severe
weather threat at this time due to lack of instability and a
weakly sheared environment. However, with PWATs increasing to
around 2 inches, brief downpours are possible.

Gusty south winds up to 25 mph will continue along the immediate
coast for the evening, then gradually dissipate.

For Wednesday, any showers and thunderstorms over eastern
sections in the morning lift NE. However, with the upper trough
slowly working across the area and a destabilizing airmass,
expect redevelopment. Initially, expect the development north
and west of NYC, but working east through the day. There could
be multiple bands translating W to E with the individual cells
tracking SW to NE. While it will not be raining much of the
time, there is a good chance for most locations to see a shower
and/or thunderstorm. Thus, rain chances are in the 50-60 percent
range. Once again severe is unlikely, but can`t rule out a
severe thunderstorm across the interior where the higher CAPE
will exits.

Increasing cloud cover tonight with the approaching upper trough
will limit cooling overnight, but will keep temperatures cooler
on Wednesday. Lows will generally be in the 70s with high in
the 80s, warmest away from the immediate coast. Right now, heat
indices around 95 are forecast to be spotty across metro NE NJ.
Should we realize more sun than forecast, values could be more
widespread.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The cold front or surface trough push through the area
Wednesday evening, ending the threat of shower and
thunderstorms. Winds will shift around to the west with some
lowering of dew points, but still very humid. Skies will clear
as well. Lows will be in the upper 60s well north and west, to
the lower and middle 70s elsewhere.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Key Points:

* Multiple rounds of showers and thunderstorms possible each day
  into Monday.

* Heat index values over 95 likely Thu/Fri and possibly into the
  weekend, especially for NE NJ, the NYC metro area, the lower
  Hudson Valley, and the interior CT river valley.

An active upper flow will be in place through much of the period,
with the area on the southern fringe of the westerlies and several
upper level disturbances moving through, which should bring diurnal
convection each day through Monday. The best days for convection
look to be Thu and again Sat/Sunday. Coverage may be more limited on
Fri as any lead disturbances ahead of a closed low over the Ohio
Valley will be moving through downstream shortwave ridging.
The closed low is poised to affect the area through the weekend.

Heat should begin building on Thu with deep mixing and downslope
flow, with more in the way of sunshine before any afternoon
convection. High temps will be in the lower/mid 90s away from south
facing shorelines, with heat index values in the 90s, possibly
touching 100 in urban NE NJ, parts of NYC, and scattered locations
across CT/Long Island just in from the shoreline where higher
dewpoints may advect in from off the ocean/Sound on afternoon sea
breezes.

Shortwave ridging on Friday should allow for heat and humidity to
continue to build, before potential for late day/evening convection
ahead of the aforementioned lead shortwave.

Friday should feature high temps similar to those on Thu  but
slightly higher dewpoints, with 95+ heat index values expected for
most of the area, and reaching/surpassing 100 mainly across NE NJ
and parts of NYC.

Temps for the weekend may not be quite as warm but could be offset
by higher dewpoints to yield 95+ heat index values in spots,
especially NE NJ and in/around NYC.

Heat advisories will likely be needed for parts of the area for Thu-
Fri, and possibly into the weekend. There will be little relief at
night as temperatures bottom out in the upper 60s and 70s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Small Craft Advisory for the ocean waters has been extended
into Wednesday due to a combination of marginal southerly gusts
to around 25 kt and seas building to 5 to 6 ft. Highest gusts
will be the first half of tonight, mainly between Sandy Hook and
Fire Island Inlet. This is due to an enhanced low-level jet
just east of NJ and into the NY Bight. SCA gusts are expected
for the south shore bays the first half of tonight as well.
Marginal SCA conditions for seas around 5 ft could linger into
Wednesday evening before subsiding. However, confidence to
extend the SCA into that time was low.

Increasing/persistent S-SW flow may allow ocean seas to
build to 5-6 ft late Sat night into Sunday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Multiple rounds of showers and thunderstorms are possible
tonight into Wednesday, again on Thu, and also this weekend.
While widespread flood impacts are not expected, localized urban
and poor drainage flood impacts are possible.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A high rip current risk should continue into Wed with S flow 15
kt and incoming 5 ft/7-sec period swells. Winds diminish and
turn more SW-W on Thu, but still expect at least a moderate
risk due to residual 3-ft swell.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.OKX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>CT...None.
NY...High Risk for Rip Currents through Wednesday evening for NYZ075-080-
     081-178-179.
NJ...None.
MARINE...Small Craft Advisory until 2 AM EDT Wednesday for ANZ345.
     Small Craft Advisory until 6 PM EDT Wednesday for ANZ350-353-
