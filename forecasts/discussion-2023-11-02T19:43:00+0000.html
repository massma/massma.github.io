.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure centered along the Mid Atlantic states pushes
offshore by early this evening and remains over the western
Atlantic with a weak cold front stalled north of the region
through Monday. Low pressure passes to the north Tuesday into
Wednesday, dragging a cold front through the area.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM FRIDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A near zonal upper flow continues tonight as surface high
pressure along the Mid Atlantic coast drifts into the western
Atlantic. With a weak southwest to west flow develop weak warm
advection sets up and continues through tonight. Good
radiational cooling will set up with clear skies and winds
decoupling. Outlying areas will see temperatures just about as
low as Wednesday night/Thursday morning, while the NYC metro
area and along the coast will be up to 5 degrees higher.
overall, temperatures will be 5 to 10 degrees below seasonal
normals. Frost likely becomes widespread inland, however, with
the growing season now over will not be issuing a frost
advisory. Along the coast areas of frost will develop later
tonight, becoming a little more widespread toward morning as dew
points slowly rise. For these locations where the growing
season remains on-going, with patchy frost and low confidence on
a longer period of areas of frost will not be issuing a frost
advisory.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM FRIDAY MORNING THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper zonal flow persists Friday and Friday night with
surface high pressure remaining across the Western Atlantic.
Low level warm advection continues with highs Friday nearing
normal Friday night`s lows a few degrees above normal. Clouds
will be on the increase Friday night, especially across the
northern tier as a shortwave approaches. The increased cloud
cover will keep temperatures from falling quickly Friday night.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure remains nearby the region this weekend.
Meanwhile, an upper level trough will will move through eastern
Canada. A cold front associated with this trough will remain
well north of the region through the weekend. While the weekend
is expected to remain dry, expect a varying mix of sun and
clouds throughout the weekend.

High pressure remains over the region Monday with another dry
day expected. The next frontal system is expected Monday night
into Tuesday as low pressure moving out of the Great Lakes
region passes well north of the area, sending its associated
cold front across the area Tuesday morning. There are some
differences with timing and placement of the low, so will stick
fairly close to the NBM/previous forecast for now. Expecting
just chance POPs through this period. The low and the front move
well off to the east for Wednesday, however some forecast
guidance is hinting at another potential low for Wednesday into
Thursday. So will continue to mention chance POPs for now.

Temperatures will be at or above normal for this time of year
Saturday through Wednesday then fall below normal for Thursday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
