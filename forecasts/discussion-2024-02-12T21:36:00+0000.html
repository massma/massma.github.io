Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
436 PM EST Mon Feb 12 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure west of the Appalachians will redevelop off the
Delmarva coast Tuesday morning, intensify and pass south of Long
Island Tuesday morning, then head well out to sea Tuesday
afternoon and night. High pressure will then return from
Wednesday into Thursday before an Alberta Clipper low passes
through Thursday night into Friday. A series of weak lows may
pass across during the weekend before high pressure returns next
Monday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM TUESDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Overcast high clouds over the area attm will give way to lower
clouds poised just SW of NYC across Philly metro and southern NJ
this evening, with a few areas of light rain/drizzle to the SW
over the DC metro area into Virginia. This precip will advance
NE this evening, reaching the area around or just after
midnight. P-type will likely start off rain at the coast with
temps falling thru the 40s and 30s and a weak elevated warm
nose, then mix with snow/sleet toward daybreak as heavier precip
starts to arrive and cools the column. Inland precip should be
primarily snow.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>* Winter storm to impact the area on Tuesday.

* Winter storm warnings issued for NYC metro and Long Island,
  where there is higher confidence in at least 6 inches of
  snowfall.

* Guidance continues to trend south. Forecast was originally
  based on the 12Z GFS/NAM but made some last-minute changes
  based on the 12Z ECMWF/NAM. This could put the metro area and
  Long Island more under the axis of higher QPF, with lesser
  amts north/west of NYC than originally anticipated.

Model guidance has continued to trend south, with the 18Z
ECMWF/NAM showing a tad less phasing with a northern stream
shortwave trough moving through the Great Lakes. This shift
should lead to lower snowfall amts quite a bit across the
interior, and put the axis of highest QPF either right over
the NYC metro area/Long Island or just south. At the last minute
blended the 12Z ECMWF with the 12Z GFS/NAM which were farther
north. Did not change headlines inland but lowered snowfall amts
to the 6-9 inches range across the interior, and if the
southward trend continues it is possible that northern areas may
less less than 6 inches of snowfall.

Meanwhile confidence has increased enough in higher snowfall
totals for the NYC metro and Long Island to upgrade watches to
warnings for those areas. Amts will be in the 4-7 inch range
around the NYC metro area were blyr temps will remain a little
warmer than areas to the NW and also across Long Island. Per
earlier forecasts of favorable deformation/frontogenetic
forcing near the coast and negative EPV* atop the frontogenetic
layer, there could be some slantwise instability and perhaps
some isolated thunder as the heaviest precip moves across in the
morning.

QPF of 1.00-1.25 inches expected only across the NYC metro area
and Long Island, with lesser amts of 3/4 to 1 inch to the north.

Snow ratios at the coast will likely be low at the onset, but
then increase as the snow becomes heavy (with rates at least
1-2 inches/hour) and low level winds become more northerly.

In addition, NE-N winds at the height of the storm will gust to
30-40 mph, strongest along the coast. This could further
restrict visibilities. However, with the wet nature of the
snow, blowing snow should be at a minimum and any blizzard-like
conditions should be short-lived.

NW winds on the back side of the low gradually subside Tuesday
night with clearing skies. Lows will be close to normal, in the
20s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No major changes have been made to the long term Wednesday
through early next week.

Key Points:

* Temperatures look to be below normal through the weekend
  before a slight warming trend early next week.

* A fast moving clipper system passes across the northeast
  Thursday night followed by another potential fast moving
  system early in the weekend.

High pressure builds towards the eastern seaboard on Wednesday.
The ridge axis will be over the area Wednesday night before
shifting offshore on Thursday. The deterministic and ensemble
means are in good agreement on this scenario. A fast moving
Alberta Clipper low continues to be signaled on the guidance for
Thursday night. The latest consensus takes the surface low
north of our area, which introduces slightly warmer air.
Moisture is still limited, but there is a brief window Thursday
night for enough lift to raise PoPs to high chance. NBM precip
probabilities continue support predominately snow showers
inland, but mainly rain with some wet snow mixed in towards the
coast. If the low were to trend further south, colder air and
higher chances of a period of snow showers could occur across
the entire area. This is a fast moving system which limits the
amount of precip that could fall.

High pressure briefly returns Friday before modeling diverges
Friday night into the weekend. Another fast moving northern
stream shortwave approaches and could bring another clipper type
low. It is beginning to look like the northern stream will be
more suppressive and force any southern energy well south of the
area. It is still about 6 days out so the evolution could still
change. PoPs on the model consensus remain low with just a
chance of snow showers Friday night into Saturday. Uncertainty
increases further on Sunday as there could be another piece of
northern stream energy passing through, but moisture right now
looks very limited. High pressure may return early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /21Z MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>*Significant winter storm to impact the terminals on Tuesday

High pressure remains in control through this evening. Low pressure
approaches the region from the southwest tonight, passing south of
the area on Tuesday.

VFR with light winds for the rest of today into early this
evening. Precip arrives generally 04-06z for most terminals with
MVFR following within an hour or two. Precip begins as rain or
a rain/snow mix at the coast, but changes to snow with IFR
conditions for all terminals by 11-13z. A low end chance
remains that some ice pellets mix in during the transition from
rain to snow, but this should be brief and confidence is not
high enough to include in the TAF. Snow then continues through
early Tues afternoon, and will be heavy at times during the
morning. Dry with VFR arriving late afternoon.

Winds under 10kt through around midnight. NE winds then increase
late tonight and will probably be strongest during the morning
push with sustained winds around 20kt and gusts around 30kt.
Winds back toward NW Tues aftn with gust still around 25kt.

Forecast Airport Snowfall Totals:

KJFK/KLGA/KEWR/KTEB/KSWF: 5-8 inches

KISP/KHPN/KBDR/KGON: 6-10 inches

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

No unscheduled amendments expected through 03Z Tuesday.
Amendments will probably be needed for flight category changes
and timing of precip changes. There is a chance that the onset
of precip and lowering flight categories are forecast to be a
few hours too soon, and there`s a chance that precip begins as a
rain/snow mix or all snow.

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

Tuesday afternoon...Snow ending and improving to VFR by late.
NW winds G25kt.

Tuesday night through Wednesday night...VFR. NW winds G20-25kt
during the nighttime and around 30kt daytime Wed.

Thursday: VFR.

Thursday night: Chance of MVFR and snow showers or mixed
rain/snow showers. NW winds G25kt late.

Friday: VFR. NW winds G25-30kt.

Saturday: Chance of MVFR/IFR with snow showers.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>NE winds increase tonight ahead of an approaching deepening low
pressure system from the southwest. The low then passes just
south and east of the ocean waters on Tuesday. This will allow
winds to reach gale force on the ocean on Tuesday, with a gale
warning remaining in effect. SCA in effect elsewhere with gusts
mostly 25-30 kt, though a few gusts to 35 kt may be possible on
the eastern Sound and the bays of Long Island. Winds on the
waters will weaken somewhat Tuesday night as the storm departs,
with SCA cond continuing mainly on the ocean and ern waters.

A steepening pressure gradient Wednesday will lead to SCA
conditions on all waters with potential for gale force gusts on
the ocean. Winds begin to weaken on the waters Wednesday
night, falling below SCA levels Thursday before potentially
reach SCA levels Thursday night into Friday. Ocean seas will be
elevated through Wednesday night before briefly subsiding below
5 ft Thursday. Elevated seas are briefly possible Friday but
should be below SCA levels next Saturday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...
There are no hydrologic issues expected at this time.

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
* Minor coastal flooding is likely during times of high tide
  through tonight.

* Widespread minor and some moderate coastal flooding becoming
  more likely with the Tuesday morning/midday high tides.

Forecast continues to be heavily based on Stevens NYHOPS
guidance, which has been performing reasonably well over the
past 24 hours.

Have decided to leave the coastal flood statement for coastal
Fairfield/Westchester running through early this afternoon
with the expectation of minor thresholds just being reached at
the Stamford and Bridgeport gauges. A better chance of more
widespread coastal flooding will be possible tonight, so have
gone ahead and issued a coastal flood advisory for tonight`s
high tide cycle.

A coastal flood advisory remains in effect for the south shore
of Nassau County for the high tide cycles today and tonight.
Further west, most of the guidance has the high tides falling
just short of reaching minor thresholds.

Depending on how some of the tides behave with todays high tide
cycles, a statement or advisory may be needed tonight. Areas
that might eventually need an advisory include southwestern
Suffolk, southern Queens, southern Brooklyn, Lower NY Harbor and
parts of western Long Island Sound. Nassau County already has
an advisory up.

Have not changed any headlines for Tuesday, there`s enough
confidence in moderate flooding to put up a coastal flood
watch for Southern Nassau County. Localized moderate coastal
flooding is possible for Southwestern Suffolk County. Otherwise,
widespread minor coastal flooding is looking more probable for
all but along the eastern Sound and along Peconic/Gardiners
Bays. Just like Monday night, there`s still time to gain more
confidence in the extent of minor flooding before issuing
headlines. Timing of a wind shift from NE to N on Tuesday brings
some uncertainty on how quickly some drainage help could occur
as well as the amount of time the north shore of Long Island is
exposed to a more direct onshore flow.
