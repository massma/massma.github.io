Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
406 PM PDT Mon Jul 8 2024

.SYNOPSIS....Very hot conditions will continue through the first
half of the week under a strong upper level ridge. Some relief is
expected mid-week as the ridge pivots eastward and weekend, though
above normal temperatures and dry conditions will persist through
the start of next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure overhead
will continue to maintain very hot and dry conditions across
western Washington. Most locations in the interior will again
increase a few degrees tomorrow over today`s high temperatures,
with areas of Moderate (orange) to Major (red) HeatRisk for much
of the region apart from the coast.  Overnight lows will also
remain in the lower 60s for areas inland, making for slow relief
from the very hot daytime highs.

Tuesday will to be the warmest days of the week for most of the
interior with the upper ridge axis moving eastward over the
region and the thermal trough shifting eastward. This will bring
some light onshore influence back to the immediate coast into the
afternoon, but again little help for the interior. The current
Heat Advisories remain unchanged for areas along the coast and
nearer the water, but it was extended to cover Tuesday night and
into Wednesday for the Everett to Tacoma corridor and all of the
Cascades. Expect that the metro area and the Cascade valleys and
foothills will remain quite warm into the day Wednesday as not as
quick to receive the cooling influence of the marine air. Cullen

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Warm temperatures are
favored to continue through the rest of the week as western
Washington remains on the periphery of a strong ridge drifting
eastward over the southern US. While light onshore flow will keep
the coast in the low 70s, areas inland will see highs in the low
to mid 80s through the period. Ensembles also remain in good
agreement over dry conditions through the week, with virtually no
signal of incoming precipitation.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong upper level ridge remains in place over western
Washington with west to southwest winds aloft. VFR conditions through
the TAF period with clear skies. A shallow marine layer looks to
redevelop along the coast tonight, bringing IFR/LIFR conditions to
KHQM beginning late tonight, burning off quickly after 15Z Tuesday.
Winds remain generally northerly 5 to 10 kt, becoming light tonight,
then increasing again tomorrow.

KSEA...VFR through the TAF period. Winds northerly, wavering from NW
to NE, at 5 to 10 kt, decreasing late tonight into early tomorrow
morning.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Thermally induced low pressure remains in place across the
interior of Western Washington with broad surface ridging over the
coastal and offshore waters. Surface high pressure will continue to
build and push eastward towards the coast through the week. A
westward push down the Strait of Juan de Fuca is expected Tuesday
evening, which warrants a Small Craft Advisory for the Central and
East Strait of Juan de Fuca, with a 60-80% chance for Small Craft
Advisory gusts. A stronger push is expected Wednesday evening, where
there exists a 50-70% chance of gusts up to gale force in the East
Strait of Juan de Fuca. Widespread Small Craft Advisory winds look
to develop Wednesday evening as onshore flow increases.

Seas 2 to 4 ft will increase on Wednesday into Thursday as winds
increase up to 6 to 8 ft, potentially reaching near 10 ft in the
outer coastal waters Thursday evening.

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will result in continued hot and dry
conditions through the first half of this week. Instability over
the Cascades will result in critical fire weather conditions
through at least Tuesday and a Red Flag Warning remains in effect.
For the lower elevations of the central and southern Puget Sound,
RHs will be in the teens and 20s but the combination of relatively
light winds, and limited fuel readiness will result in elevated
but perhaps not critical conditions. We will continue to monitor.
Weak onshore flow will bring somewhat higher humidities, late
Wednesday through Thursday. That said, temperatures will remain
well above normal with dry conditions through the next week.
