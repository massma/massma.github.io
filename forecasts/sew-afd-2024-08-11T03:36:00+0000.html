Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
836 PM PDT Sat Aug 10 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Warm conditions will continue today across the
interior with cooler conditions along the coast. Thunderstorms
will remain possible over the Cascades with areas of smoke and
haze aloft. Upper level troughing over the region will persist
over the region the next several days, promoting onshore flow
and cooler temperatures.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Another active afternoon
across the North Cascades with numerous thunderstorms moving
southeast across the mountains of Whatcom and Skagit counties.
Elsewhere, lingering haze and some scattered clouds were the story
with daytime highs running around 5 degrees or so cooler than this
time yesterday. Onshore flow will bring a return of marine stratus
into the interior tonight. The forecast remains on track this
evening, and the previous short/long term sections follow.

An upper low will drop down from British Columbia on Sunday and
deepen the troughing over the Pacific Northwest through the
remainder of the short term period. Another round of thunderstorms
will be possible across the North Cascades on Sunday, however
probabilities will be lower than today and generally persist at
15-25%. Onshore flow will increase and we should see less
smoke/haze over western Washington from nearby wildfires. Another
round of stratus will move inland overnight into Sunday morning,
though expect clouds to take a little longer to scatter out on
Sunday. Temperatures will be cooler as a result, topping out in
the 70s across the interior and mid 60s along the coast.

Upper level troughing will keep temperatures cooler on Monday and
Tuesday, with highs topping out in the 70s across the interior
and 60s along the coast. Additional rounds of stratus look to
move inland during the overnight and early morning hours both
days. Isolated thunderstorm chances are still possible for the
North Cascades on Monday afternoon and evening.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Troughing will continue
to influence the Pacific Northwest from mid to late week, promoting
onshore flow and slightly below normal temperatures in the 60s
and 70s. Another upper level low looks to drop down from the
north late in the week, potentially bringing some chances for
precipitation over higher terrain by next weekend, though will
need to see how this pattern evolves over the next several days.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest flow aloft with upper level troughing
continuing over western Washington. Mostly clear skies and VFR
conditions prevail across most of the area, except along the Pacific
coast where marine stratus continues to persist resulting in IFR
conditions. Some convective clouds over the Cascades with
diminishing thunderstorm activity. Aforementioned stratus should
push inland once again overnight tonight across the interior, with
widespread IFR to LIFR coverage by 12Z Sunday. Ceilings will be slow
to dissipate but should return to VFR by midday. Winds will remain
southwesterly 5 to 10 kt throughout the TAF period.

KSEA...VFR conditions this evening and tonight with mostly clear
skies. Marine stratus and IFR ceilings will return overnight around
12Z Sunday. Ceilings may rise a touch to low-end MVFR tomorrow
morning, but then should slowly scatter out by around 21Z Sunday.
Winds remain southwesterly 5 to 10 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Broad high pressure over the East Pacific with low
pressure inland will maintain northwesterly onshore flow over the
area waters. Diurnally driven pushes down the Strait of Juan de Fuca
will occur each evening. Inherited SCA panning out in the Central
Strait...but not so much in the East Entrance. Models remain
consistent in allowing these speeds to spread eastward and as such
will leave headline in place unchanged. Winds are expected to pick
up across the coastal waters tonight, but the strongest winds should
be largely confined to the outermost portions of the area. After
tonight, winds look to largely remain below thresholds through next
week.

Seas 4 to 5 ft will increase tonight up to 6 to near 9 ft into the
outer coastal waters. With the dominant period being 8 seconds,
waves will be steep. A Small Craft Advisory remains in effect for
steep seas in the outer coastal waters from tonight through Sunday
afternoon. Seas will subside on Monday back to 3 to 5 ft and remain
like so through the week.
