.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A wet and cooler weather pattern will continue into
Saturday as an upper level low moves through western Washington.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low is
beginning to move into western Washington this afternoon, with
increasing shower activity into the evening. Recent radar imagery
depicts these scattered showers across the interior, with most of
the activity located within the South Sound. Additionally, the
air mass continues to be unstable this afternoon, with a chance of
thunderstorms possible into early this evening. Latest hi-
resolution guidance highlights most of the possible thunderstorm
activity to likely be in the SW interior, although cannot rule out
a thunderstorm over Puget Sound. The primary impacts from any
thunderstorms that do develop will be heavy downpours, lightning,
and some small hail or graupel. Snow levels will drop to around
5000 ft with a few inches of snow possible on the higher peaks in
the mountains.

The upper level low will continue to move through western
Washington into Saturday, with the bulk of the shower activity
falling tonight into Saturday morning. Shower activity will
gradually decrease through Saturday, although a few showers will
likely linger in the mountains. High temperatures will remain in
the mid 60s for the interior.

The upper level low will move eastward on Sunday, allowing for
conditions to dry out across the area and warm up slightly, with
temperatures in the upper 60s and low 70s across the interior.
Conditions will continue to dry out as a broad high pressure
builds on Monday across the region, with temperatures warming into
the mid to upper 70s across the interior, with areas along the
water in the mid 60s.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...High pressure will remain
over the area over midweek, with temperatures in the interior
warming into the low to mid 80s, likely being the warmest day in
this stretch. Uncertainty lies going into the end of the week,
where ensembles are hinting at cooler but drier conditions, but
also a chance of some weak systems crossing the area. For now,
have kept mostly dry conditions resuming throughout the long term
period with high temperatures in the upper 60s into lower 70s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper-low will meander over the region through
Saturday. Variable flow aloft is prevailing as a result. VFR area-
wide this afternoon with isolated MVFR. Can`t rule out more
instances of MVFR cigs during this time under heavier showers.
Mostly VFR slated to remain this evening but MVFR cigs will return
between 08-12z Saturday with steadier rainfall. IFR possible as
well. VFR returns by Saturday afternoon as conditions trend drier.

KSEA...VFR currently with showers in the vicinity of the airfield.
VFR slated to remain tonight, but steadier rain will arrive with
MVFR cigs around 10-11z Saturday. Southerly wind gusts upwards of 20
kt are possible around this time. MVFR expected throughout the
remainder of Saturday morning before gradually lifting to VFR during
the afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure meandering over the region through Saturday.
It`ll progress off and away on Sunday, with high pressure building
in its wake. A weak system will dissipate over the coastal waters
Monday. High pressure building again Monday night and Tuesday before
an additional system arrives midweek.

A SCA remains in effect for the central/eastern Strait while a new
SCA has been added to the outer coastal waters for winds as well
starting late tonight. These headlines should be allowed to expire
on Saturday, with the Strait of Juan de Fuca in the morning followed
by the outer seas in the afternoon.

Seas building to near 10 feet later tonight into Saturday for the
outer coastal waters before subsiding Saturday night.
