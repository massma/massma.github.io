Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
305 PM PST Tue Feb 18 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper ridge over the region will move inland
tonight, allowing for a warm front to move into western Washington.
Lowland rain and mountain snow are expected across the area as a
trailing front moves across the region on Wednesday. Another weak
ridge will build into the region Thursday, though western Washington
will still see some rain chances through Friday as another series
of fronts approach the region. An atmospheric river looks to move
into western Washington over the weekend, bringing heavy rain to
the area into early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge over
the region this afternoon will push inland tonight, allowing for
a warm front to move into the area. Radar is already starting to
show some light precipitation moving into the central coast this
afternoon. Expect rain to continue to make its way inland from
the southwest tonight. Snow levels will start out between 3000-3500
feet across the Cascades, so expect to see some light snow for
the mountains tonight.

Rain will then continue for the lowlands and snow for the
mountains on Wednesday as a trailing occluded front moves across
the area. Snow levels will increase to 3500-4500 feet Wednesday
for additional mountain snow. Easterly winds at Snoqualmie early
Wednesday morning ahead of the front could keep the pass cooler.
Cannot rule out the possibility of a slight chance of freezing
rain at Snoqualmie Pass, but current temperature profiles look
more favorable for snow at this time. Expect snow accumulations to
generally be between 5-7 inches for Stevens and Snoqualmie Pass,
with higher amounts of 8-11 inches possible for areas like
Paradise and White Pass through early Thursday. Thus, a Winter
Weather Advisory is in effect for the south-central Cascades of
Pierce and Lewis counties. Total rainfall amounts for the lowlands
will primarily range between 1-1.5 inches for the coast and from
a couple tenths of an inch to three quarters of an inch for the
interior through early Thursday. Breezy conditions are also
expected in the Cascade foothills, the coast, and north of
Admiralty Inlet ahead of the frontal system and generally look to
range between 25-40 mph. Highs will trend into the upper 40s to
low 50s across the area.

Showers will then taper by late Thursday morning as a weak upper
level ridge moves back into the region. A chance of light precipitation
does still exist for the coast and northern interior, however, as
a warm front rides the ridge and brushes the region to the north.
Highs will be in the upper 40s to low 50s across western
Washington.

A trailing cold front is slated to push into western Washington
on Friday and weaken over the area. Overall precipitation amounts
look to remain rather light, with most lowland locations currently
only looking to receive a couple hundredths to a tenth of an inch
of rain. Areas along the coast could see locally higher amounts
towards a half an inch. Snow levels will generally look to hover
between 4000-5000 feet, so only expect light amounts of snow for
the mountains. Highs will be in the low to mid 50s.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...A wetter weekend is on tap
for western Washington as an atmospheric river scenario develops
Saturday and looks to remain over the region into early next
week. While there`s still a decent amount of spread in ensembles
regarding the precipitation amounts across western Washington at
this time, have trended the forecast towards the wetter side of
the distribution for now. Have the QPF trending closer to the
90th percentile of the NBM for areas along the Olympics and 50th
percentile for the Cascades. With snow levels expected to rise
between 6000-7000 feet on Saturday, expect significant rises on
area rivers over the weekend. Rain chances look to continue into
Tuesday as latest guidance hints at another, quicker moving system
traversing the region. Temperatures over the weekend and into
next week look rather mild, generally trending in the low to mid
50s for highs and low to mid 40s for lows. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft will become southwesterly and
increase tonight into Wednesday as a frontal system moves towards
the area. Generally VFR/MVFR this afternoon across Western
Washington with increasing high clouds ahead of the next system.
Cigs will mainly fluctuate between VFR/MVFR tonight into Wednesday
afternoon, with predominantly MVFR for the coast for the majority of
the period, although brief improvements possible. Rain will also
spread onshore through this evening, and slide eastward into Puget
Sound tonight through Wednesday morning. Lowering of vsbys towards 3-
5SM possible in rain during this period, especially for the coast.
Otherwise, S/SE winds will increase tonight into Wednesday, becoming
breezy for some areas.

KSEA...VFR expected into tonight. Cigs may lower to MVFR between 08z-
10z as rain increases into Wednesday morning. Otherwise, low-end VFR
expected into Wednesday afternoon before cigs lower Wednesday
evening. Periods of rain on Wednesday. Light S/SE winds through this
evening. E/SE winds will increase Wednesday morning, with gusts of
20 to 25 kts possible on Wednesday, before winds shift more SW
Wednesday evening. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A warm front will lift northwards across the offshore
waters into tonight for increasing southerly winds. Another front
will then move through on Wednesday for continued increased winds.
Gales are expected for the Coastal Waters and portions of the inner
Coastal Waters through midday Wednesday. A Gale Warning has also be
issued for the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca due to increased
southeast winds tonight into Wednesday. Small Craft Advisories
elsewhere for the Strait of Juan de Fuca and northern inland waters.
Winds will transition more westerly for the Coastal Waters Wednesday
afternoon. A Small Craft Advisory has been issued following the
gales for the outer Coastal Waters, and will have to monitor any
potential gale force gusts Wednesday afternoon as well. Otherwise,
winds will briefly subside on Thursday.

Additional weather systems are expected Friday through the weekend
resulting in increasing winds and the potential for Small Craft
Advisories or gales for some of the area waters. Seas will build to
10 to 17 feet tonight into Wednesday morning. Seas will then remain
above 10 feet, especially for the outer Coastal Waters through
Thursday morning. Seas will subside later Thursday before building
again on Friday through the weekend. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A pair of frontal systems will move across
western Washington tomorrow and Friday. Snow levels will remain in
the 3000 to 3500 ft range. No river flooding is forecast with these
systems, but this looks to push the Skokomish river into action
stage on Thursday into Friday.

Model consensus remains will that an atmospheric river is expected
to setup over the region this weekend and potentially into Monday.
This will be a much warmer and moist system with snow levels pushing
into the 6000 to 7000 ft range. There remains discrepancies in the
total duration and strength of this system, but there is a high
probability (70-90%) of receiving at least 3 inches of widespread
rain through much of the Olympics and Cascades by Monday morning,
with the highest amounts focused along the south/southwest Olympics
(where there is a 30-60% probability of seeing at least 5 inches of
rain) and the central Washington Cascades.

The latest forecast has the Skokomish River cresting around the
minor/moderate threshold Sunday. Many rivers in the central Cascades
and Southwest Interior are forecast to get into action and close to
flood stage this weekend into early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
