Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
819 PM PDT Sat Oct 12 2024

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>We`ll see a quiet evening across W WA as an upper-ridge
maintains. Marine layer action offshore will push inland
overnight with a cloudy start to the day in the cards for the
coast and possibly into Puget Sound. Can`t rule out patchy mist
squeezing out of it. Overnight lows are to fall into the mid 40s
to mid 50s. The previous discussion remains below along with an
updated marine/aviation section.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...An upper level ridge over western Canada and
Washington ill produce dry and mild conditions this weekend. The
weather becomes more fall like next week with as multiple frontal
systems impact the region via atmospheric rivers. The potential
exists for substantial rainfall, high mountain snow, and locally
gusty winds, especially in the second half of the work week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...Morning fog coverage has
completely cleared (based on visible satellite), and blue sky
dominates western Washington this afternoon, thanks to an upper
level ridge over the state and up into western Canada.
Most places are seeing temperatures in the 60s (just after 1 PM
PDT) - and they will continue to rise into the upper 60s to low
70s this afternoon. Sunday will be a similar start to Saturday
morning, with low cloud/fog coverage in the morning (especially
south of Puget Sound). Any low cloud/fog coverage will lift up by
mid to late Sunday morning, with a few more clouds hanging around
Sunday afternoon (and upper 60s/low 70s for highs).

The pattern changes late Sunday night/Monday as the ridge begins
to depart the region, giving way to a large-scale upper level low
and trough from Alaska digging down the Pacific coastline. The
jet max will help funnel in limited moisture from the Pacific
(setting this system up as a weaker atmospheric river event Monday
through Tuesday via a cold front). Rainfall amounts with this
first system will be light, with mean average QPF totals right now
averaging around a tenth to a quarter of an inch in the lowlands,
half an inch for the north Cascades, and half an inch to an inch
along the coast/Olympics. The 25th and 75th percentiles of the NBM
fluctuates the previously mentioned estimates by a tenth to two
tenths of an inch of precipitation. Will continue to monitor and
fine tune potential totals getting closer to the system`s arrival.

Additionally, there`s an increase in the potential of sneaker
waves along the coastline Monday (which may impact anyone
recreating along the coastline, including beaches). The front will
also bring cooler temperatures, with highs dropping to around 60
by Tuesday (lows still in the 40s and 50s).

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...A second atmospheric
river event is expected to impact the region Wednesday through
Friday. Ensembles show that the trough axis (and an additional
cold front) will move across the state Wednesday, with a surface
trough and strong jet max on the back side of the trough peaking
at over 130 knots. This will funnel more moisture into the region
for what will likely be several days of continuous precipitation
across western Washington. What people across western Washington
will likely see with this system is first: breezy winds with the
front coming through Wednesday (right now appears local areas may
see gusts at or over 20 mph), snow levels dropping to around 4,000
feet (producing snow at elevations at or greater than that
level), and periods of rain. With this system still being 4 days
out, amounts are still hard to pin down (due to the wide range of
possible totals in the NBM). Once the system gets closer and
confidence in the amounts increase, the forecast details will be
more fine-tuned, with this being the first fall-like system in the
state.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>South to southeasterly flow aloft this evening into
tonight as W WA finds itself in split flow with a ridge to the north
and an upper level low passing through OR to the south. As these
features move eastward overnight, flow aloft will shift more
southwesterly by Sunday morning as an upper level trough over the
Pacific becomes the dominant factor. Surface flow largely light and
variable through much of the TAF period for most terminals, with
occasional southerly winds from time to time. Speeds will remain
less that 5 kts for the most part, however some spots along the
coast may see speeds 4-8 kts starting late Sunday morning.

VFR conditions in place this evening will degrade by early Sunday
morning with most models indicating some fog development for many
terminals. Of course this is a given for those more prone to this
development...such as PWT, OLM and HQM...but models also making
suggestions that SEA and BFI may be impacted as well. Key factor in
limiting any kind of advection is the fact gradients over the area
remain pretty weak. While this ordinarily might be a factor for not
including SEA/BFI in on the action, fog present Saturday morning in
that area suggests that a repeat performance may be in store for
Sunday morning. Inherited TAFS have included this prospect and will
likely not make any alteration to that for the 06Z issuance.
Widespread VFR conditions are expected to return Sunday after 18-20Z.

KSEA...Above fog discussion applies. VFR conditions will remain for
this evening and much of tonight. Latest models show cigs falling to
IFR with vis reductions in the 09-12Z time frame. Output is only
slightly less impactful than what is in current TAF, so will leave
inherited reduction to 1/4SM OVC001 in place for now. VFR conditions
return after 18-20Z and remain in place for the remainder of the
day. High clouds expected to roll in toward end of TAF period in
association with incoming pattern change expected for start of new
week.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light winds are expected for the interior waters with
south to southeast winds over the Coastal Waters into Sunday.
Southerly winds will increase, especially for the Coastal Waters,
Sunday afternoon into Monday morning as a front moves across Western
Washington. At this time, there is approximately a 60-80% chance of
Small Craft Advisory winds for the majority of the Coastal Waters,
with the highest probabilities along the outer Coastal Waters. Will
advise overnight shift to act on latest guidance for headline
consideration. Heightened seas Monday into Tuesday will pose
additional beach hazards such as sneaker waves. Please refer to
details within the above short-term forecast discussion. South winds
will also increase for portions of the interior waters Monday
morning, particularly Admiralty Inlet and eastern Strait of Juan de
Fuca, but speeds likely to remain below SCA criteria. A stronger
front looks to move through Tuesday night into Wednesday for another
period of breezy winds. In addition, a post-frontal westerly push is
expected through the Strait of Juan de Fuca later on Wednesday.

Seas 6 to 8 feet into Sunday. In the southern portion of the coastal
waters, caution should be exercised into Sunday as there is
potential for nearly squared seas. Seas expected to build further to
11 to 13 feet Sunday night into Monday, subsiding briefly below 10
feet on Tuesday before rising again Wednesday and into Thursday.
