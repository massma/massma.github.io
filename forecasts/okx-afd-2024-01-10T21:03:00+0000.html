Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
403 PM EST Wed Jan 10 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure moves northeast into southeastern Canada tonight. A
weakening clipper system passes north of the area late Thursday into
Thursday night. Another strong low pressure system will track
to our west and impact the area Friday night into Saturday. High
pressure briefly builds in for the rest of the weekend into
early next week. A coastal low may impact the area sometime
early to mid next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure at the surface will head into northern New
England and southeastern Connecticut tonight, slowly weakening as it
does so. This will allow the pressure gradient to gradually relax
through the night, which will mean diminishing winds. Winds have
been lower then forecast all day, and winds of 45 to 50 mph do not
seem likely at this point, even with cold advection getting
underway, therefore, have cancelled the Wind Advisory for the entire
area, as gusts should be limited to the lower 30 kt range or less
for the first few hours of the evening. An isolated gust may reach
the 45 to 50 mph range this evening, especially for eastern areas,
but this is not enough to warrant the continuance of the advisory.
Gusts diminish to around 20 mph by daybreak.

In the upper levels, some very weak riding out ahead of an
approaching weakening shortwave from the central Great Lakes region
moves across northwestern New England and southeastern Canada. This
will allow for dry conditions tonight.

Despite clouds being on the decrease with the low exiting the
Northeast, the breezy conditions will keep temperatures above normal
for this time of year, in the upper 20s to middle 30s across much of
the area.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH 6 PM THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The upper level shortwave and its associated surface low will move
into the western Great Lakes region Thursday, then into northern New
England tonight, weakening as it does so. Dry conditions will
continue Thursday and Thursday night. High temperatures continue to
be above normal, in the lower to middle 40s.

Weak high pressure at the surface builds in quickly, moving overhead
by daybreak Friday. This will allow for some colder temperatures,
especially in the outlying areas, but still above normal for this
time of year. Lows will be in the middle 20s in the outlying areas
to middle 30s in the metro area.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

Thereafter, SCA will likely need to be issued for waves on the ocean
and central and eastern sound waters. Waves on the ocean waters
start off this evening around 10 ft to as high as 17 ft and will
diminish through Thursday, but will remain above 5 ft through the

coastal flooding continues to recede this evening. Breaking
waves of 10 to 15 ft along the oceanfront will result in beach
flooding and scattered dune erosion with this evening high tide.

tide Friday night and Saturday with another deep low tracking
west of the area.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
