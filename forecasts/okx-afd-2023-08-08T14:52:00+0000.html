Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
1052 AM EDT Tue Aug 8 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front will move through this morning into this
afternoon. High pressure builds in for tonight into Wednesday
and then offshore Wednesday night. This will be followed by a
storm system on Thursday. High pressure then returns for Friday
and lasts into at least part of Saturday before another system
potentially impacts us later in the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The heavy rain showers and thunderstorms has pushed east of the
forecast area. The cold front is currently moving through
western and central portions of the area. Otherwise, the
forecast is on track.

Expecting the cold front to be east of the region by mid to
late afternoon, as westerly winds become gusty and advect in
drier air. The parent low will still be in Northern New England
moving to the northeast. Model BUFKIT soundings also show a
prominent inversion developing above 800mb which should really
limit the instability and thereby diminish the thunderstorm
threat going through the remainder of the afternoon. With the
drier air, shower coverage will become less and less and shift
to just the interior which will be closer to the higher positive
vorticity and cold pool aloft with the trough axis moving in.

Temperatures forecast were a blend of MOS consensus and the NBM,
with values ranging from the upper 70s to lower 80s. Forecast
dewpoints to start the morning are near 70 but by mid to late
afternoon will be lowering down in the 60s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
For tonight, in the mid levels, a trough axis will be moving east of
the region with nearly steady height tendency with more of a zonal
flow setting up.

At the surface tonight, the low will be moving northeast out of
Northern New England and towards the Canadian Maritimes. Across the
local region, high pressure will build in from the south and west.

Dry weather is expected tonight. Subsidence will not be as strong
with zonal flow aloft and without ridging. However, with some
subsidence and positive pressure tendency, clouds are expected to
decrease through the night. The combination of partially clearing
skies and winds staying up within the boundary layer will lead to
temperatures not radiatively cooling effectively. NBM and consensus
of all guidance used for low temperatures, a less vast and
relatively warmer range staying mainly within the 60s.

For Wednesday, mid level ridging occurs but surface pressure remains
nearly steady as the center of high pressure stays south and west of
the area. Low pressure stays also in the Canadian Maritimes. Dry
conditions remain and do expect more sun with that subsidence aloft.
Breezy westerly flow also remains and will help provide a very warm
but not too humid day. Max temperatures forecast are well into the
80s but with dewpoints just in the upper 50s to lower 60s, heat
indices will not be a factor. Apparent temperatures will be nearly
the same as the actual temperatures.

For Wednesday night, the mid level ridge moves into the region and
eventually east of the region by early Thursday morning. At the
surface, high pressure will move east of the region and
offshore. This will allow for surface winds to become more
southerly. In addition, clouds will start to move in from the
west out ahead of the next low pressure system. Once again, not
optimal radiational cooling, with forecast lows ranging from the
low 60s to low 70s.

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
Low pressure tracking through SE Canada then drags a cold front
toward the forecast area. This along with the potential of a
weak offshore low passing nearby brings chances of showers and
maybe a thunderstorm Thursday into Thursday evening. High
pressure returns for Friday with a dry day, then low pressure
emerging from the northern Great Lakes Region is progged to pass
to our north Saturday night into Sunday. This will bring a
chance of showers and thunderstorms mainly from Saturday
afternoon through Sunday evening. The flow aloft may then become
slightly cyclonic on Monday, bringing a diurnal threat of a
shower or thunderstorm.

Temperatures through the long term period are expected to be near
normal with with high temperatures mostly in the lower and middle
80s.

&&

.AVIATION /15Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure passes north of the area this morning, dragging a
cold front across the terminals.

Showers/storms across eastern Long Island and southeast
Connecticut have ended. MVFR ceilings still persist through
about noon, with VFR expected to prevail thereafter. An
isolated shower cannot be ruled out at the Lower Hudson Valley
terminals this afternoon.

SW winds around 10 kt will veer to the W and increase to
15-20kt with gusts 22-28kt by early afternoon. A few higher
gusts to around 30 kt possible. Sustained winds and gusts likely
weaken a bit tonight, but should still see gusts 16-20 kt at NYC
terminals into early Wednesday morning.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Improvement to VFR could be delayed by 1-2 hours.

Onset of wind gusts may be delayed by 1-2 hours. A few peak
gusts up to 30 kt possible this afternoon.

OUTLOOK FOR 12Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

Wednesday: VFR. W wind gusts around 20 kt.

Thursday: VFR.

Thursday Night-Friday: Mainly VFR. Chance of showers and MVFR. A
slight chance of thunderstorms Friday afternoon.

Saturday: Mainly VFR. Slight chance of afternoon showers and
thunderstorms mainly for NYC north and west.

.MARINE...
SCA for the ocean goes through tonight and for east of Fire Island
Inlet on ocean goes until 14Z Wednesday. SCA on non-ocean waters
18Z this afternoon until 04Z Wednesday. Otherwise, sub-SCA on
non-ocean waters until 18Z this afternoon and late tonight into
Wednesday morning. For Wednesday afternoon through Wednesday
night, sub-SCA conditions for all waters.

Thereafter, mainly sub-SCA conds expected on all waters into late
week.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
Occasional heavy rain and minor flooding possible, mainly
across eastern sections of the region for Eastern Long Island
and Southeast Connecticut through early this afternoon where
there could be more thunderstorm activity. Otherwise, mainly
dry for this afternoon and dry conditions tonight through
Wednesday night.

Heavy rain is possible late Thursday into Friday, but at this
time there remains too much uncertainty to determine any
potential hydro risk.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
A high rip current risk for all Atlantic-facing beaches expected
today as seas build to around 5 ft with gusty 15 to 20 kt winds.

Moderate risk of rip currents forecast at the ocean beaches on
Wednesday.
