Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
815 PM PST Sun Dec 22 2024

.SYNOPSIS...The active pattern continues with multiple frontal
systems moving through the area bringing periods of rain, mountain
snow, and gusty winds. The focus shifts towards Christmas into
late next week with potentially higher-impact systems with heavy
rain and snow and gusty winds, especially when combined with
holiday travel.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Rain tapering off tonight
with a break expected on Monday. There`s a rain/snow mix in the
passes with a change over to rain expected overnight as winds turn
westerly and snow levels rise. Large swells reaching the coast on
Monday and a High Surf Advisory is in effect. 33

Previous discussion...A cold front is currently sitting just
offshore and moving through the area this afternoon, with rain
showers moving across the area. Snow levels are fairly high across
the region (around 5000 ft). Light easterly flow is keeping
temperatures near freezing at the surface over the passes with
light snow showers and some light accumulation. Precipitation will
taper off tonight. Monday looks to be mostly dry through the day
with the next system Monday night into Tuesday. The warm front
will move early Tuesday morning with mostly rain. Easterly wind at
the passes will keep the snow levels locally lower for another
period of a few inches of accumulating snow. East winds will also
pick up area wide early on Tuesday, with the strongest winds
expected through the Cascade gaps, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and
the Pacific Coast, where gusts 30 to 40 mph are possible. The
cold front will move through later in the morning on Tuesday,
allowing winds to ease Tuesday morning and stratiform rain will
transition to scattered showers.

Another break in the rain is possible Tuesday night before a more
substantial system arrives Christmas Day. This system looks to be
the wettest compared to the previous systems with more of an
atmospheric river type setup. Most of the rainfall will be over
the Pacific coast and the Olympics, where widespread 3 inches of
rainfall, with local peaks 4-5 inches are expected. Around an inch
of liquid precipitation is expected for the lowlands and the
Cascades. Snow levels will be higher to the west, around 4000-5000
ft, while closer to pass level over the Cascades, with
significant accumulating snowfall above 3000 ft in elevation,
especially later in the day into Wednesday evening. Winds will
also be very gusty on Wednesday, with strong south to
southeasterly winds along the coast and the north interior being
the strongest.

In addition to precipitation, building waves along the coast will
create several periods of high surf conditions, with the first
being Monday, with additional periods of high surf possible
Tuesday into Wednesday. Waves will initially be long period, with
significant wave run-up and erosion being the primary impacts
Monday before large breakers become more likely early Tuesday and
Wednesday.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...An extended wet period will
continue Boxing Day into next weekend for continued rain, heavy
mountain snow above 3500 ft, and periods of gusty winds. The upper
level pattern looks messy with many back-to-back waves with
little to no breaks between them. This will cause impacts from
rain and snow to slowly increase through the weekend. High tide
levels will also begin to increase next weekend, and with the
active pattern showing no signs of slowing down, this could create
impacts as early as next weekend even though the highest tides
will not occur until the first week of January.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper trough and associated front is moving onshore
across Western Washington this evening. Southwest flow aloft will
become west to northwesterly overnight into Monday as shortwave
upper ridging moves across the area. The flow aloft will become
southwesterly and increase Monday night as another front
approaches the area.

A mix of VFR and tempo MVFR ceilings in scattered showers will
prevail into early Monday morning. Primarily VFR ceilings are
expected much of Monday with increasing high/mid level moisture by
afternoon ahead of the next front. Ceilings will lower to MVFR in
rain along the coast 03Z-06Z Tuesday with said conditions
spreading to the interior terminals in the early hours of Tuesday.
Gusty S/SE surface winds will develop along the coast Monday
evening and spread to portions of the interior lowlands overnight.

KSEA...Ceilings will occasionally dip to around 2500 to 3000 ft
at times with area of showers shifting onshore this evening.
Otherwise, expect ceilings at or above 3500 feet through Monday
morning. Increasing high and mid clouds are in the cards for
Monday afternoon with rain probably not reaching the terminal
until near or after 06Z Tuesday. Surface winds southerly 8 to 12
knots through the overnight then easing early Monday morning and
backing to E/NE 5 to 8 knots in the afternoon. Gusty S/SE winds
will develop Monday evening/night as occluded front moves into
the area. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak surface ridging will briefly build across the
interior waters early Monday in the wake of a front that is
moving onshore this evening. Easterly gradients will tighten
during the day on Monday as a surface low deepens to around 980
millibars 400 nautical miles west of Hoquiam late Monday
afternoon. It is expected to continue to deepen to sub 970
millibars as it lifts northeastward toward Haida Gwaii Monday
night. This will push an occluded front across area waters early
Tuesday. Gales are likely with this front across the coastal
waters and near the entrances to the strait with small craft
advisory conditions across all other waters.

A secondary system will quickly follow on its heels Christmas
night into Boxing Day. Similarly, this system also has strong
potential to produce another round of gales (or stronger) for the
coastal waters and strait entrances. This pattern is expected to
persist into next weekend as a series of vigorous fronts and
strong surface lows impact the waters. Seas look to remain quite
hazardous for the foreseeable future with wave heights over the
coastal waters remaining in the 15 to 20 foot range much of the
time. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A series of frontal systems will move through western
Washington next week and bring several rounds of precipitation.
The most hydrologically significant system will be the atmospheric
river arriving Christmas into Thursday, with few breaks in the
precipitation late week into next weekend.

Currently, the Skokomish river is the only river of concern before
Christmas - minor flooding is occuring. There is a chance it may
dip just below minor flood Wednesday but will likely remain in the
upper end of action stage. The system Wednesday will potentially
push the river into moderate early on Thursday and looks to remain
in flood stage through at least late-week.

Wednesday`s system will also increase the level of concern to
other area rivers in the Olympic Peninsula and the Chehalis Valley
area where higher snow levels (4000-5000 ft) will prevail. Lower
snow levels are expected over the Cascades, but with chances for
significant perception continuing through late week, significant
rises and additional river flooding cannot be ruled out going into
next weekend. Additionally, this precipitation will enhance the
risk for landslides across the area which may create significant
impacts to holiday travel.
