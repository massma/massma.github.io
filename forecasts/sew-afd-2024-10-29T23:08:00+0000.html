.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Temporary weak upper level ridge will move through
tonight bringing an end to the shower activity. A series of
frontal systems will move through the area through Friday. The
system moving through later tomorrow will bring breezy winds,
lowland rain, and mountain snow. The systems for Thursday and
Friday will not have as much wind and precipitation. Unsettled
weather will continue over the weekend with another front arriving
the first part of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows a
lot of cumulus clouds over the area this afternoon. Shower
activity has decreased significantly this afternoon with just a
few showers left from Snohomish County northward. A few sunbreaks
allowed temperatures to warm to near normal, in the lower to mid
50s.

Temporary upper level ridge moving through the area tonight
bringing about an end to what is left of the shower activity.
Skies will clear briefly this evening into the early morning
hours before the high clouds ahead of the next system reach the
area. Lows in the upper 30s to mid 40s.

Next frontal system reaching the coast Wednesday afternoon. Rain
out ahead of the front spreading over the area in the morning.
Cool unstable air mass behind the front for a chance of
thunderstorms over the coastal waters and along the coast late in
the day. Breezy conditions developing along the coast and over the
Northwest Interior with gusts as high as 35 mph. With rain most
of the day temperatures will be on the cool side with highs in the
upper 40s to mid 50s.

Front moving through the interior of Western Washington Wednesday
evening with steady rain changing to more showery precipitation.
With the lack of daytime heating even with the cool unstable air
mass moving over the interior chance of thunderstorms remaining
west of Puget Sound Wednesday evening. Snow level near 3500 feet
but precipitation amounts will only create a few inches ( 2 to 4
inches ) of snow for the mountains. The exception will be in the
Cascades in Pierce and Lewis county where the snow level will be a
little higher, around 4000 feet, but the precipitation amounts
will be higher ( 5 to 9 inches ). A Winter Weather Advisory has
been issued through 12z Thursday morning. Lows upper 30s to mid
40s.

A brief lull Thursday morning for the interior with another
frontal system moving quickly across the Pacific reaching Western
Washington late Thursday. Rain out ahead of the front along the
coast in the morning with the rain spreading inland late
morning/midday. Not as windy with this front. Highs in the lower
to mid 50s.

Last system in the series moving into the area Friday. The
operational runs have this system mostly moving inland south of
the area. The ensembles indicate a more northerly track keeping
rain in the forecast. Little change in the temperature scenario
with lows upper 30s to mid 40s and highs lower to mid 50s.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Unsettled weather
continuing through the weekend. Not a lot of agreement in the
operational runs with the GFS bringing a weakening front into the
area Saturday night while the ECMWF has an upper level trough
moving through Saturday followed by a weak upper level ridge. The
ensemble solutions agree with the operational runs. All of the
ensembles have a least a few wet solutions for each period over
the weekend keeping a chance of showers in the forecast. Better
agreement on a stronger frontal system arriving the first part of
next week. Some differences in the timing with the ECMWF moving
the front through Monday while the GFS is 12 to 18 hours slower
with the frontal passage. ECMWF ensembles a little slower than the
operational run so forecast leans toward the GFS solution with
rain Monday night into Tuesday morning. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak upper ridge over the region will shift eastward
tonight with increasing southwesterly flow aloft as a frontal system
approaches the area. Ceilings will gradually improve this afternoon
and evening as the air mass dries and low level offshore flow
develops. Ceilings will deteriorate to low MVFR in rain along the
coast by mid-morning Wednesday with said conditions spreading to
interior terminals 18Z-20Z.

KSEA...Ceilings are gradually lifting this afternoon. Increasing low
level easterly flow will dry the low levels and high level clouds
will increase ahead of an approaching frontal system. Ceilings will
abruptly drop back to MVFR in rain by 19Z or 20Z Wednesday.
Additionally, low level wind shear is likely just ahead of the front
Wednesday morning with low level easterly flow and strong southerly
flow developing aloft. Surface winds light southerly backing to E/SE
tonight and rising to 8 to 11 knots Wednesday A.M. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak surface ridge over the inland waters will shift
eastward tonight. An occluded front will move through the coastal
waters Wednesday morning then push inland in the afternoon. Gale
warnings are in effect for the coastal waters and east entrance to
the strait with small craft advisories for the remainder of the
strait and Northern Inland waters. Winds will ease Wednesday night
into Thursday as a filling surface low tracks southeastward across
the offshore waters. Weak surface ridging rebuilds over the waters
later Friday into Saturday before a weak front arrives during the
later half of the weekend.

Coastal seas will build back into double digits Wednesday afternoon
and Wednesday night and remain hazardous into Friday. Seas are
expected to drop below 10 feet late in the week, if only briefly,
before building back above 10 feet early next week. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
