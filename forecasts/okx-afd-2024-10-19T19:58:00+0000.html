Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
358 PM EDT Sat Oct 19 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure remains in control for early week. For Wednesday, high
pressure moves out into the Atlantic. A cold front approaches from
the west Wednesday night, moving across early Thursday. Another area
of high pressure gradually builds in from the west thereafter.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SUNDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure continues to dominate the weather pattern tonight.
Clear skies and light winds will allow temperatures to fall into the
30s and 40s, with the NYC metro remaining in the 50s. The usually
colder spots, especially well north and west of NYC will see chance
for frost once again. Not sure the frost development will be
widespread enough for any headlines so have decided to hold off for
now.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure remains over the region to end the weekend, however a
southwesterly flow develops during the day Sunday. This will allow
temperatures to be a bit warmer than what get observed in the near
term. Expect temperatures on Sunday to climb into the lower and
middle 70s across much of the area. The only exception will be
across the far eastern portions of the CWA where highs may only
reach the upper 60s. Some of the models area hinting at a weak
trough passing over the area Sunday afternoon, this may result in
just a few clouds late Sunday afternoon into the evening. Otherwise,
expect a mostly sunny day.

For Sunday night, clear skies continue with generally light winds.
however with a warming trend underway, overnight lows only fall into
the 40s and 50s. A few isolated spots may fall into the upper 30s.
With the warmer conditions, frost will be much less likely.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Main upper jet well north of the region early into the midweek,
followed by more of a dip in the jet going into late week. Mid
levels convey ridging Monday through Tuesday. Mid levels then show
ridging moving offshore for midweek as a shortwave moves across. A
longer wavelength mid level trough then moves in for late week.

At the surface, high pressure remains in control for early in the
week but will be moving out into the Atlantic Tuesday night into
Wednesday. A cold front then approaches from the west, eventually
moving across early Thursday. Then, airmass with origins in SW
Canada into North Central US starts to work its way into the region
thereafter into the start of next weekend. High pressure will make
its return.

The long term forecast period from Monday through the start of next
weekend does not have much of any rainfall in the forecast. Just a
slight chance with a cold front moving across late Wednesday night
into Thursday. Cold front with much westerly flow in atmosphere will
not have much moisture to work with. If any rain occurs, it will
probably be quite low amounts. Airmass will eventually become colder
by mid to late week. Temperatures trend from well above normal early
into mid week to closer to normal going into late week.

Used the NBM 90th percentile for high temperature forecast for
Monday and Tuesday. Substantial warm air advection expected. Used
the MEX guidance for low temperature forecast for Monday night and
Tuesday night to better capture radiational cooling with greater
spatial differences in temperature. Thereafter have NBM forecast for
temperatures with minor adjustments.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
