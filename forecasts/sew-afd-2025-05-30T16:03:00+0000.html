.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the region will bring warmer and
drier conditions. A weak frontal system will move over the region
on Saturday. Weak disturbances moving over the region will keep
precipitation chances for the Cascades into early next week. The
next frontal system arrives on Thursday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The inherited forecast
remains on track and no significant updates were made this
morning. Please refer to the previous discussion below, as well as
as an updated aviation section.

Warm and dry weather returns today with a weak ridge over the
region. Highs in the interior will reach the 70s to lower 80s this
afternoon. The coast will be cooler and in the 60s with NW flow.
The ridge exits east on Saturday while a trough moves in from the
west. This trough will bring showers to the coast during the
morning, with showers reaching the interior from late morning to
afternoon. We`re under post-frontal onshore flow Saturday night
with showers mainly focused in the interior (convergence zone) and
the Cascades. Onshore flow prevails on Sunday with weak troughing
over the NW. Showers are mainly to our north in B.C. with a weak
disturbance. Temps are close to average with highs in the mid to
upper 60s. 33

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...An offshore ridge is
nearly stationary next week, keeping WA under N/NW flow. The
forecast is mainly dry through the period with average to slightly
warmer than average temperatures. By midweek, the flow becomes
more westerly with light showers returning as a weak system rolls
in. 33/29<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>VFR conditions will prevail through the TAF period.
Expect clear skies to continue today, with increasing cirrus
clouds tonight. Winds are light north/northeasterly and will
become more north/northwesterly through the morning hours,
peaking at around 5 to 10 kt this afternoon.

KSEA...VFR conditions prevail though the TAF period. Light
northeasterly winds persisting at the terminal this morning. Winds
will become northwesterly over the next few hours and increase to
5 to 10 kt by this afternoon.

.MARINE...Broad surface high pressure over the Pacific Northwest
is lending itself to tranquil conditions over coastal waters
today. A weak frontal system will move through Saturday morning.
Then, a strong 1036 mb high pressure system will quickly usher in
behind the front. This will allow for breezy northwesterly winds
to develop, beginning Saturday afternoon. A thermal surface trough
attempts to develop along the coast, but looks to be mostly
confined to southern Oregon into California, where the strongest
winds will be along the West Coast. These winds will persist all
the way through at least Tuesday as the high slowly retreats
westward. Wind speeds look to remain in the Small Craft Advisory
category, but gusts to low-end gale force cannot be ruled out
during this period.

As for the interior waters, a westerly push down the Strait of
Juan de Fuca is expected Saturday afternoon/evening behind the
frontal system which looks to reach Small Craft Advisory criteria.
Following, west/northwest winds will prevail into early next
week with no additional headlines expected at this time.

Seas remain 4 to 6 ft today. Seas begin to increase Saturday
afternoon up to 8 to 12 ft and will remain there through Tuesday.
Waves may reach as high as 12-14 ft in the outer coastal waters
during the periods of strongest winds. The dominant period will be
quite short, around 7 to 8 seconds, making for very choppy seas
Saturday evening through Tuesday.
