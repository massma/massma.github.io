Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
953 PM EST Tue Dec 3 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure over the Tennessee Valley will remain in control
through tonight and early Wednesday as it slides farther southeast
and eventually off the southeast coast. A strong clipper low will
pass to the north and impact the area Wednesday night through
Thursday night. High pressure builds back in from the west
Friday and into the weekend, sliding offshore Sunday. An area of
low pressure may then approach the region early next week.

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Snow showers/flurries will be possible over eastern LI before
midnight, otherwise mostly clear conditions as a shortwave heads
farther out to sea to our east. Wind gusts should subside soon too
now that the initial shot of CAA in association with the
shortwave is ending.

High pressure centered over the Tennessee Valley will remain in
control through the near term and will continue to slide
farther southeast. The pressure gradient over our area weakens
slightly tonight, and in turn, the winds weaken. Stuck mainly
with the NBM for lows for now, but given little cloud cover,
some areas may be able to cool below current forecast lows. MOS
guidance was not too much lower than the NBM, so manually
lowered the usually cool spots a couple of degrees lower than
the NBM.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/...
The aforementioned high that will be sliding to our south will move
offshore by Wednesday afternoon. In response to this and an
approaching clipper low, mid and high level clouds increase and
winds become southwesterly. Highs could reach the low 50s across
Long Island and the coast, but most will see highs in the 30s to low
40s.

The aforementioned clipper low will impact the area Wednesday night
through Thursday night. Potent shortwave energy that originated from
near the north pole will dive down and aid in deepening this low as
it passes to our north. The GFS continues to show the upper level
trough becoming negatively tilted just to our west, but other
guidance has this happening later or not at all. Regardless,
this system will bring rain, snow, strong winds and cold air.

There has been little change in the precipitation forecast. The
rain/snow line as been pretty steady across guidance for several
cycles now. All snow is expected across the Lower Hudson Valley and
interior NJ and CT to start Wednesday night, becoming a rain snow
mix Thursday morning and then ending as lighter snow later on
Thursday. The highest QPF continues to be out east where all rain is
expected, so as far as snow totals go, still expecting sub-Advisory
totals (few hundredths to a couple of inches). There will be periods
of moderate rainfall across the Twin Forks and eastern CT. Rainfall
totals there will be between 0.50 and 0.75 inches. No hydrologic
impacts are expected.

The more impactful weather from this system will likely be the
strong winds. A Wind Advisory is now in effect for the entire area.
SW winds pick up Wednesday evening and night, but winds and gusts
look to peak Thursday behind the cold front with deep mixing in cold
air advection. There is good consensus in NAM and GFS forecast
soundings that the mixed layer at least briefly reaches 800mb
(~2km). The NBM also has the mixed layer depth around 1.5-2.0km
Thursday afternoon. Winds at that level look to be 45 to 50
knots. With strong cold advection this should lead to at least a
period of 45 to 50 mph wind gusts at the surface.

Winds gradually lower Thursday night. Cold air rushes in behind the
system and lows should be in the 20s for most. Combined with the
winds, wind chill values will be in the single digits and teens.

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
Key Points:

 * A chilly and windy Friday.
 * High pressure and gradual warming Saturday and Sunday.
 * Uncertainty surrounding rain chances Monday-Tuesday.

As the Alberta Clipper low continues to exit far to our northeast on
Friday, high pressure simultaneously builds in from the west. A
tight pressure gradient remains to start Friday, but gradually
relaxes into the evening. NW wind gusts between 25-35 mph are
possible into the early afternoon, before gradually subsiding in the
late afternoon and evening on Friday as they turn to a more westerly
direction.

Much cooler air filters in post-front, leading to a cold Friday with
highs in the 30s. Some interior areas are currently forecast to
barely stay below freezing Friday afternoon. Given the breezy
weather, wind chills will be in the 20s across the area Friday
afternoon. Friday night, lows will be in the 20s to mid-teens. A
bias-corrected model blend (BCCONSAll) was used for low temperatures
Friday and Saturday night to account for colder spots due to
radiational cooling, since winds would be lighter, allowing more
radiational cooling.

High pressure moves nearby Saturday then to our south and southeast
Saturday night into Sunday, bringing winds in from a more
southwesterly direction. This will lead to gradual warming through
the weekend. Highs on Saturday remain in the 30s for most, but a few
southern coastal areas may reach the low-40s. Saturday night lows
will be in the low-20s to near freezing. Sunday will be much warmer
a heights build aloft under a longwave ridge and warm air advection
takes place at 850mb along with a continued SW wind. Highs will be
in the low/upper-40s on Sunday then into the upper-20s to upper-30s
Sunday night.

Monday and Tuesday a series of lows are expected to traverse the
region, aided by a strong jet stream. However, model guidance still
varies widely on timing, location, intensity, and even the number of
lows that could develop and impact us. For now, going with a rainy
solution given the likely warmer temperatures. Capped POPs at 50%
due to the uncertainty surrounding these systems.

.AVIATION /03Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure remains in control through Wednesday afternoon. A
cold front then approaches late Wednesday night.

VFR through at least 00z Thursday, then a chance of MVFR and
rain, snow, or a mixture of the two Wednesday night. Better
overall chances of precipitation will be east of the city
terminals.

NW winds before midnight 10-15kt with gusts 20-25kt should
become more WNW at around 10kt overnight and last through Weds
morning. Winds then increase from the SW in the afternoon with
gusts around 20kt. SW winds increase further Wednesday night
with gusts 25-30kt.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB)TAF Uncertainty...

No unscheduled amendments expected.

OUTLOOK FOR 00Z THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...

Wednesday night: Varying conditions across the terminals:

* KSWF: Snow likely with MVFR/IFR cond expected and
  accumulation close to an inch.

* KHPN/KBDR/KTEB/KEWR/KLGA/KJFK: MVFR and mixed rain/snow
  likely.

* KISP/KGON: Rain with MVFR with a chance of IFR.

* SW winds G20-30kt at the NYC metros and along the coast.

Thursday: MVFR cond possible with lingering rain/snow showers,
improving to VFR by afternoon except at KGON. W winds G25-30kt
early, increasing to G40kt by afternoon.

Thursday night: VFR. WNW winds G35-40kt early, gradually
diminishing to G20-25kt late at night.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A shortwave has helped kick up winds over the past couple of
hours with widespread SCA conditions. Since winds will subside
in the next couple of hours and prevail below advisory
thresholds, no plans to issue a short-fused and short-lived SCA
for tonight.

A clipper system is still on track to pass to our north and bring
strong winds to the area. The Gale Watches have been converted to
Gale Warnings on all waters. A Small Craft Advisory is in effect for
the ocean waters and eastern Sound for Wednesday afternoon for 25 kt
gusts ahead of the gale conditions. By Wednesday night, gale
conditions are expected on all waters, although more marginal for
the NY Harbor, western Sound and Central Sound. By Thursday, gusts
peak at 40 to 45 kt. Seas also peak Thursday at 12 to 14 feet, with
waves on the central and eastern Sound reaching 5 to 7 feet.
Conditions gradually lower Thursday night to Small Craft Advisory
criteria and then below SCA level by early Saturday. Sub-SCA
conditions are then expected through the start of next week.

The long duration of offshore winds combined with the strong
offshore winds we are expecting with this system could result in
abnormally low water during the Thursday afternoon and evening low
tides. This is mainly for the NY Harbor and western NY Sound. This
will have to monitored over subsequent forecast cycles, but a Low
Water Advisory may be needed as navigation could be difficult in
shallow waters.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
