Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
914 AM PST Sun Nov 17 2024

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The forecast remains on track as showers push inland
across western Washington today. Some of which may produce
rumbles of thunder as a slight chance (15%) exists. Any lingering
rainfall at the passes should transition to snow as snow levels
fall to 2,000 ft behind a passing cold front. The previous
discussion remains below along with an updated aviation section.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...Cool and unstable post frontal air mass moving into
Western Washington this morning. Upper level trough remaining
over the area into early Tuesday keeping unsettled weather in the
forecast. A strong frontal system approaches late Tuesday and
pushes through Wednesday with possible high winds in the Cascade
foothills Tuesday night. The active pattern will likely continue
into next weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Satellite imagery and
shows cold front moving inland early this morning. Steady
precipitation out ahead and with the front with widely scattered
showers behind the front. Increasing west northwesterly flow aloft
with the front creating a rain shadow in the Central Puget Sound.
Temperatures were in the mid 40s to lower 50s.

Cold front will be out of the area later this morning. Cool and
unstable post frontal air mass moving over Western Washington the
remainder of the day. By late afternoon 500 mb temperatures will
be below -30C over the entire area. Snow levels will drop to near
2000 feet. Shower activity will increase as the cold air moves
inland. The destabilizing of the air mass will create the
potential for thunderstorms especially west of the Puget Sound and
possibly in a developing convergence zone later this afternoon
over Snohomish county. High temperatures will not be much
different than the current temperatures, near 50.

Cool upper level trough remaining over the area tonight.
Convergence zone over Snohomish county dissipating overnight. The
convergence zone will extend into the Cascades with the best
chance for the highest new snow accumulations in the Cascades near
Stevens Pass. Lows tonight in the mid 30s to lower 40s.

Nothing organized for Monday and Monday night. Cool and unstable
air mass remaining over Western Washington keeping showers in the
forecast. 500 mb temperatures remaining below -30C through late
Monday night. New snow amounts in the Cascades will ease as the
shower activity becomes more widespread. Will stay with the winter
storm warning until 10 am/18z Monday. Total snow accumulations
from late this morning through Monday morning in the 6 to 18 inch
range. Higher amounts most likely near Stevens Pass.

Changes in the pattern taking shape Tuesday as a very strong low
develops well offshore. Very cold air spilling out of the Gulf of
Alaska running into warm sub tropical air around 150W. Throw in a
160 knot jet core and you have the ingredients for bombogenesis.
The operational ECMWF has the surface low going from 1000 mb at
06z Tuesday near 41N/143W to 959 mb at 18z Tuesday near 45N/133W.
Low turning north Tuesday afternoon with the low center remaining
west of 130W. Rate of intensification decreasing with the low
near 950 mb at 06z Wednesday. The operational GFS is similar to
the ECMWF in track and strength. Front associated with the low
also offshore but close enough to spread rain over the area later
Tuesday. The strongest impacts from this system initially is the
possibility of high winds in the Cascade foothills Tuesday night.
Not only do the cross Cascade gradients decrease rapidly,
bottoming out near -14 mb on some models, the winds aloft show
good flow reversal. Model 850 mb winds easterly at 30-40 knots
while the winds at 700 mb are south southwesterly at 40-60 knots.
This flow reversal brings up the possibility of mountain wave
activity Tuesday evening. Always hard to predict where the
mountain waves will surface if they develop. In past mountain wave
events Enumclaw, Buckley, Black Diamond and as far west as Maple
Valley have been hit by surfacing mountain waves. A little too
early to issue a high wind watch. A weaker low or a more westerly
track, certainly possible with the rapid intensification, will
result in lighter winds for the foothills. This scenario will be
monitored closely in the next 48-60 hours.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Confidence in the
extended models beyond Wednesday not very high. Front moving into
Western Washington Wednesday for a wet and breezy day. Beyond
that the operational and ensemble solutions show a lot of
variability. There is a general trend that it will remain wet over
the area through at least Friday. Some of the solutions for
Saturday have the storm track sagging south leaving Western
Washington dry. These solutions are in the minority right now but
there are certainly more dry solutions for Saturday on the 00z
runs this morning versus yesterday morning. The operational ECMWF
takes the strong surface low Wednesday and moves it west and
weakens it then it makes a left turn and comes back towards
Western Washington before it takes a turn southeast aiming at
California closer to the weekend. The GFS moves the strong low
Wednesday off to the northwest Thursday with two surface lows
forming off the west coast Friday. The ensemble means keep things
wet into Saturday and given the high degree of uncertainty that
is what we are going to go with in this forecast package. Felton

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft will gradually become more west-
southwesterly through the day today as an upper level trough axis
moves onshore. At the surface, a frontal system continues to move
across the interior of western Washington this morning, bringing
rain and breezy winds to some of the area terminals. Surface winds
generally persist out of the S this morning and will shift more to
the W/SW in the wake of the frontal system. Wind gusts to 20-25 kt
across the interior terminals have finally tapered off this morning.
Expect scattered showers moving onshore throughout the day. A Puget
Sound Convergence Zone (PSCZ) is likely to develop across
King/Snohomish counties this afternoon and will linger through this
evening.

Expect conditions to remain mostly MVFR through the much of the
day, with some TAF sites likely only seeing some improvement towards
VFR conditions by late afternoon. Some locations more prone to lower
cigs (such as KOLM, KPWT and KPAE) may see MVFR conditions persist
through the remainder of the TAF period. Isolated thunderstorms
will be possible for terminals along the coast and for areas
generally south and west of the Sound today, though confidence
remains too low for inclusion in TAFs at this time.

KSEA...MVFR conditions expected through much of the day. A slight
improvement towards VFR conditions is possible, but is not likely
until the late afternoon/early evening hours. Gusty S/SW winds this
morning have eased in recent observations, and will generally
persist out of the SW at 7-12 kts through the day. Latest guidance
indicates the PSCZ will remain near the King and Snohomish County
lines and not drift toward the terminal. Confidence remains low,
however, so will need to continue to monitor CZ trends between the
23-02Z timeframe. 14/Kristell<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...A frontal system continues to push across the region
early this morning. Gusty winds overnight will gradually ease
across the area throughout the morning hours, allowing for the
small craft advisories and gales to gradually come down over the
next few hours. A small craft advisory will remain in place for
the coastal waters, however, with seas generally ranging between
9-11 feet this morning. Expect seas to build towards 12-18 ft by
tonight and for small crafts to likely be extended across the
coastal waters and West Entrance of the Strait through Monday.
Models have been consistent in regards to an intense sub 960-millibar
surface low deepening over the offshore waters Tuesday night.
While there remains uncertainty regarding the exact track and
strength of this system, expect another round of strong winds to
develop over the coastal waters. Latest NBM probabilistic
guidance indicates a 50-60 percent chance of gusts reaching Storm
Force criteria (48 kts or greater) across portions of the coastal
waters Tuesday afternoon and evening. In addition to strong winds,
seas are expected to build significantly over the coastal waters,
with GEFS probabilistic wave guidance indicating a 60-70 percent
chance of waves building to greater than 20 ft by 12Z Wednesday.
Winds will gradually subside through the day Wednesday, however
expect the period to remain active with additional systems
expected to move into the region late in the week. 14

.HYDROLOGY...Precipitation rates have decreased significantly in
the last few hours over the Olympics. The Skokomish River is
still below 16 feet, flood stage is 16.5 feet, and barely rising.
With the steady rain ending with the frontal passage and colder
air moving into the area it is going to be hard for the Skokomish
to get to flood stage this morning.

The next hydrologically significant event will be in the middle
of the week. There are some indications of another atmospheric
river setting up somewhere over or near the region Wednesday. This
would have the potential to bring steadier rain and higher snow
levels, which could lead to the potential for flooding later this
week. Felton
