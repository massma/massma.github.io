Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
331 AM PDT Fri Jul 26 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak upper level trough slides across the region
today and remains through the weekend. A passing front Monday will
bring widespread rain chances to the area, with showers lingering
into Tuesday as the upper trough moves through. Weak high pressure
aloft begins to build again toward midweek.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow continuing this
morning with some patches of low stratus evident near the coast
and near the western Strait of Juan de Fuca this morning. With the
weak upper trough in place over the region, not expecting much
change in the pattern into the weekend. Onshore flow will persist
and mostly dry conditions continue, though an embedded disturbance
may be enough to bring a few light showers to the North Cascades
Saturday afternoon or evening. Otherwise, temperatures holding
close to normal for this time of year with some morning clouds and
abundant afternoon sunshine.                        12

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Confidence has slightly
increased in the potential for a stronger frontal system to sweep
across Western Washington around Monday. With a relatively
impressive tap of moisture (for this time of year) spreading
into the region, there`s still around a 70% or better chance of
measurable rain area-wide with at least even chances of a
measurable rain across portions of the mountains. This will be a
brief break with the cooler temperatures and rain, though, as
ensembles suggest a return to the high pressure by around midweek.
This will again bring a return of above normal temperatures for
the late stages of next week, as temperatures in the interior
climb into the 80s and a drier pattern returns.     12<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Flow aloft is becoming light northwesterly with an upper
level low (east of the region now), and high pressure over the
Pacific. A weak onshore push this morning will bring low MVFR
stratus (to potentially IFR) for terminals along the coast, and as
far east as the Olympics. This will retreat to the ocean through the
morning hours. Light patchy fog is also possible briefly this
morning around sunrise. Otherwise expect clear to mostly clear skies
at remaining terminals today. Winds out of the north/northwest 6 to
10 kt.

KSEA...VFR expected today (few to scattered VFR clouds possible this
morning that will burn quickly after sunrise). Northeast winds
becoming north-northwest 6 to 10 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore to northwest flow will continue via low pressure
east of the Cascades, and high pressure over the coastal waters in
the Pacific. The small craft advisory has expired in the
central/east Strait of Juan de Fuca overnight, and the next best
chance of a breezy push through the Strait coming up to 20 kt is
Saturday afternoon and evening.

This morning: satellite was showing areas of potentially low stratus
from Quillayute to Neah Bay to Port Angeles (which may reduce
visibilities in some areas). This stratus will retreat to just off
the coastline today. Northwesterlies winds will pick up over the
outer coastal waters. The probability of winds exceeding 20 kt (or
gusting to 25 kt) dropped to around 20 percent, which did not raise
enough confidence in a small craft advisory for today (but still
cannot rule out a gust exceeding 20 kt). The seas will range from 4
to 6 feet with a period of 15 seconds, subsiding to 3 to 4 feet next
week.

A frontal system will move through the region early next week. At
this time the threat for breezy winds impacting small craft is low.
