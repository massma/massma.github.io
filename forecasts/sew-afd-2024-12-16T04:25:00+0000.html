Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
825 PM PST Sun Dec 15 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A series of fronts will maintain unsettled conditions
across western Washington through Tuesday morning. An atmospheric
river will bring in significant precipitation mid-week alongside
warmer temperatures and breezy winds, though the exact details
remain uncertain. Unsettled and warmer conditions are favored to
continue through the end of the week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The latest forecast
remains on track with no updates this evening. A warm front will
continue to lift across the region tonight, bringing in steady
precipitation that will continue to pivot northward through Monday.
Winds will continue to pick up, primarily along the coast and
over area waters, overnight as the front slides northward. Snow
levels will hover between 1500-2500 ft with this system, and while
ensembles show a low (20% to 30%) chance of 6 inches of snowfall
through Snoqualmie and Stevens Passes, the early morning timeframe
may cause travel impacts during the morning commute. A Winter
Weather Advisory remains in effect for much of the Cascades
through Monday afternoon with accumulations of roughly 2 to 6
inches above 3000 ft, with the heaviest snowfall occurring in the
early to mid morning. By Monday afternoon, precipitation will
change over to showers with a few sun breaks and highs nearing the
50 degree mark across the lowlands.

Another wave of showers will move northward across western
Washington Monday evening into early Tuesday morning as a weak
disturbance passes overhead. This will generate little more than
breezy winds across the coastal waters and light precipitation
with snow levels near 2500-3000 ft.

An atmospheric river storm system will move into the region on
Tuesday, lifting a warm front and subsequent cold front across
western Washington mid-week and bringing in heavier precipitation
and breezy winds. While models continue to show differences over
the timing and intensity of this storm system, models highlight
the potential for significant rainfall with snow levels closer to
5000-6000 ft over the Olympic Peninsula. Ensemble mean forecasts
show 48 hour liquid totals of around 5 to 7 inches along the
northern coast and over the Olympics, while the 90th percentile
shows a potential worst- case scenario closer to 8 to 10 inches.
The northern half of the western Washington Cascades could also
see significant rain and snow with liquid amounts around 4 to 6
inches, and the lowlands could see rainfall amounts between 1 to 2
inches. With snow levels also low during the onset of this event,
significant snow over the Cascades and a period of freezing rain
Tuesday night into Wednesday morning through the passes cannot be
ruled out. However, the exact details of the evolution of this
atmospheric river event remain uncertain and will continue to be
monitored. The incoming precipitation will likely cause
significant rises to area rivers, with river flooding favored to
occur but confidence is low over the areal extent and severity.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Operational models are in
good agreement over some brief drying on Thursday, but details
remain uncertain heading towards the end of the week. Troughing
is favored to continue offshore as a high pressure ridge builds
over the western US, but the forecast will be highly dependent on
how westward the high pressure develops. Ensembles favor the
unsettled pattern to continue, with potential for additional
significant precipitation and warmer temperatures.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West to northwest flow aloft will back to southerly and
increase late tonight into Monday as another upper trough and
associated frontal system approaches the region. Mid to high level
clouds continue to work their way into the area tonight, with light
rain working its way from southwest to northeast. With this, expect
ceilings to gradually lower to MVFR from 06Z-12Z tonight. MVFR
ceilings look to prevail into Monday through most of the TAF period,
though a brief rise to VFR is possible Monday afternoon/evening at
the Seattle area terminals. East winds will prevail through the TAF
periods, locally gusty at times near gaps in terrain late tonight
into Monday morning.

KSEA...VFR with high and mid level clouds increasing this afternoon
and tonight. Developing easterly flow should dry out the low levels
to some degree tonight and preclude the development of MVFR ceilings
until 09Z-12Z Monday. Low MVFR in rain expected much of Monday.
Surface winds easterly 5 to 10 knots through much of the TAF period.
Winds switch to southerly again mid-late morning on Monday before
returning to easterly Monday afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak surface ridging shifts eastward and a warm front will
lift northward over the coastal and offshore waters tonight.
Easterly gales will continue across coastal waters and the west
entrance to the strait with small craft advisory strength easterlies
expected across the remainder of the strait and northern inland
waters tonight into early Monday morning. A weakening occluded front
will push inland during the morning on Monday. Broad troughing will
remain poised over the offshore waters through much of the week as a
series of systems pivot onshore with many periods of gusty winds
over the area waters.

Although coastal seas have dropped below 10 feet, they will build
back into double digits tonight and likely remain hazardous for
much of the foreseeable future thereafter.

.HYDROLOGY...Area rivers will rise with additional precipitation
through Tuesday morning ahead of an incoming atmospheric river
event that will cause significant rises to area rivers. Latest
deterministic forecasts show incoming liquid amounts of 4 to 7
inches over the Olympic Peninsula between Tuesday and Wednesday,
with up to 4 inches over the Cascades. Snow levels will also be
elevated during this event, lifting as high as 6000-7000 ft
Tuesday night. The 90th percentile shows potential for up to 8 to
10 inches of liquid over the Olympic Mountains mid-week, which
would contribute to significant river flooding. The exact details
of this mid-week system remain uncertain, but at this time the
Skokomish River is forecast to enter Moderate Flood Stage on
Wednesday with multiple area rivers reaching Action Stage.

Additional incoming precipitation towards the end of the week
maintains the threat of river flooding across western Washington,
but models continue to show large differences and the forecast is
uncertain.
