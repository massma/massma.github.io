Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
340 AM PDT Fri Nov 1 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Unsettled weather continues through the weekend, with
the bulk of the precipitation expected today as a weather system
moves across Western Washington. Another stronger frontal system
is expected on Monday with lowland rain, breezy winds, and
mountain snow. Drier weather possible midweek.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Widespread, steadier showers
continue across Western Washington early this morning with an
upper low lingering offshore. Precipitation will likely peak in
intensity through midday for most of lowlands, but showers will
continue through early Saturday as the trough slowly progresses
eastward. The primary impact through early Saturday will be
continued mountain snowfall. Forecast QPF amounts have generally
risen over the last 12 hours, thus increasing snowfall amounts,
particularly in the North Cascades. Latest snow total forecasts
generally range 10 to 15 inches as a storm total for Mt. Baker Ski
Area, with amounts of 8 to 12 inches for Rainy Pass. For this
reason, the Winter Weather Advisory was upgraded to a Winter Storm
Warning into tonight for this area. Winter Weather Advisories
also continue for the central and southern Cascades, with
additional snowfall amounts heaviest around Mt. Rainier.

Showers may briefly taper off later tonight into Saturday morning
for Puget Sound and Olympic Peninsula, with continued light
precipitation for the Cascades. Another weakening front will bring
an uptick in precipitation potential Saturday night into early
Sunday morning. In general, unsettled weather continues over the
weekend, particularly for the Cascades. Temperatures will remain
slightly below normal through the weekend, with highs in the upper
40s to mid 50s.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...A rather potent storm
system will move into British Columbia on Monday, bringing lowland
rain, gusty winds, and heavier mountain snow to Western
Washington. Ensembles have trended higher with QPF for this system
Monday into Monday night, thus increasing the mountain snowfall
totals for this period. Snow levels look to range 3500 to 4500
feet, with accumulating snowfall for Stevens Pass. In addition,
ECMWF EFI (Extreme Forecast Index), which helps identify periods
of anomalous weather conditions, is highlighting winds on Monday
for areas of Western Washington. This is evident further looking
into individual EPS members. NBM probabilities (from Everett
northward, along the water) range 50 to 90 percent for the 24 Hour
Max Wind Gusts exceeding 45 MPH from 06z Monday through 06z
Tuesday. All in all, this helps increase confidence in breezy
conditions with this system on Monday, in addition to the mountain
snowfall. For those drier weather fans, ensembles highlight
ridging building into the Pacific Northwest beginning Wednesday
into Thursday. There remains a lower chance for rain during this
period, mainly along the BC border, but majority of ensemble
members remain drier overall. Temperatures begin cooler Monday and
Tuesday before warming Wednesday and Thursday into the mid to
upper 50s. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West-southwesterly flow aloft as an upper-low churns
just west of the Vancouver Island coast. Mostly VFR currently
observed but MVFR cigs will become more widespread as the morning
progress. Slight improvement possible to VFR during the afternoon
but, continued rainfall won`t make it easy with localized visibility
reduction at play. A mixed bag of VFR/MVFR conditions are likely to
continue overnight into Saturday as rain breaks into showers.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings at this time and remaining through the morning.
Meager improvement to low-end VFR is possible towards midday but,
continued rainfall will help to keep visibilities down. HREF Grand
Ensemble has 60-70% probabilities of vis less than 6sm during this
time. East southeast surface wind between 8 to 12 kt becoming more 5
to 10 kt for the second half of the day. Winds transition more SSW
overnight into early Saturday along with a mix of VFR/MVFR
conditions.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A 1000mb surface will continue to fill and track into WA
today. Headlines remain with SCA continuing for the coastal waters
and Grays Harbor Bar for high seas. Buoy observations continue to
show waves around 10 to 11 ft. A SCA for winds also remain for the
East Strait this morning. These products will be allowed to expire
today as marine weather is forecast to become more benign than seen
recently. These conditions will trend into Saturday but seas will
increase above 10 ft once again by early Sunday morning and building
upwards of 15 to 20 ft on Monday as a potent surface low passes to
the north, slamming into Haida Gwaii. Here we`ll see the return of
strong winds across area waters before conditions peter out into
Tuesday as surface ridging takes hold and remain through midweek.
