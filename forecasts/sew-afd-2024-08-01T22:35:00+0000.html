Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
335 PM PDT Thu Aug 1 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure aloft will strengthen into the end of
the week for a trend toward warmer and dry conditions. The upper
ridge will weaken somewhat early next week and onshore flow will
strengthen for a modest cooling trend, but temperatures look to
remain above normal with dry conditions continuing. Weak
shortwaves may pass over the area this weekend and into the
beginning of next week, creating a marginal thunderstorm potential
over the Cascades.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A broad upper level ridge
will remain the primary feature driving the weather over western
Washington. Some light easterly winds in the low levels this
morning has brought some light smoke and haze over the crest into
eastern King and Pierce counties. This will get pushed back east
tonight. Smoke in the upper levels will be brought in from the
south tonight and into tomorrow, which may act to slightly limit
(perhaps only a degree or two) tonight`s low and tomorrow`s high.

Today looks to be the warmest day on the Pacific coast, with
high temperatures in the 80s for most, into the 90s through the
Southwest Interior and the Cascade Valleys. Tonight`s low also
looks to be the warmest across the region, reaching the low to mid
60s. Friday will be the warmest day through the Puget Sound
lowlands as the ridge begins to creep eastward--into the upper 80s
to low 90s. Temperatures along the coast will be about 10 degrees
cooler, into the 70s.

Saturday and Sunday will be fairly similar as the ridge continues to
slowly shift eastward. Sunday may be a touch warmer through the
interior lowlands, but not by a significant amount.

Overall, HeatRisk values remain Orange/Moderate across most of the
interior lowlands north of Pierce County Friday and onward, down
to Yellow/Minor elsewhere.

There is the potential for a weak shortwave to move through the
area this weekend, which may permit some elevated instability over
the Cascades and spawn a thunderstorm or two, but model consensus
is not quite there yet and the moisture profile is fairly dry, so
potential is very limited at this moment. More certainty will come
on the details once we enter the hi-res model time frame.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...The ridge remains parked
over the Four Corners region through the extended, with western
Washington likely remaining dry and with above average
temperatures. Models are hinting at the potential for some
shortwave troughs to pass through the region, but solutions are
quite divergent. Despite the uncertainty this will be something
to watch as that indicates the potential of thunderstorm activity
over the Cascades.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure remains over the region with mostly
clear skies. Flow aloft becoming southwesterly and continuing into
Friday. May see a few high clouds at times, especially increasing
overnight. Some smoke toward the Cascades as smoke from regional
fires drifts into the region. VFR through the period with the
exception of patchy fog around the coast after 12z for a few hours
with ceilings around 500 ft or lower and restricted visibility. This
will clear by 17z Friday morning.

KSEA...Breezy northerly winds this evening will gradually ease
overnight. VFR continues under mostly clear skies with increasing
high clouds overnight. Winds likely become light southerly tonight
through Friday.                                             12<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Thermal low pressure along the coast will shift inland
tonight with a brief reversal to southerly winds across much of the
waters. However, high pressure rebuilds over the northeastern
Pacific this weekend through early next week. This will maintain
mostly diurnally driven winds with stronger northerlies over the
coastal waters and westerlies through the Strait of Juan de Fuca
each afternoon and evening. Winds may get close to advisory criteria
in the central/eastern Strait Friday evening and may need an
advisory. Meanwhile, seas over the coastal waters will build to
around 7 feet toward the weekend and will be rather steep given the
persistent northwest winds. This is particularly the case beyond
about 20 nm from shore.                                        12<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
