Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
509 AM EDT Fri May 31 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will build toward the area through Friday, and
remain in control through Saturday as it moves off the Mid
Atlantic coast. A weak disturbance will approach late Sunday and
move across Sunday night into Monday morning. High pressure will
then take control of the weather through Wednesday before a cold
front approaches on Thursday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Clouds with the weak trough (now to the south) are still over
the area mainly from NYC north/west, with a few sprinkles also
in the NYC area. These should move SE, with a mostly sunny start
to today. Some mid level clouds may move across the area,
especially inland and across Long Island this afternoon. N flow
10-15 mph with a few gusts to 20 mph should back NW by
afternoon, and there may be a SW sea breeze along the immediate
south coastlines late this afternoon.

High temps today should be on the warm side, near 80 in urban NE
NJ and in the mid/upper 70s elsewhere.

Skies become mostly clear tonight, with NW winds diminishing to
5-10 mph through this evening in the metro area and becoming
light elsewhere. Low temps will range from the lower 60s in
NYC, to the upper 40s in the interior valleys and Long Island
Pine Barrens.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.SHORT TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure sfc and aloft will be in control this weekend,
with temps reaching 80-85 in most areas both days. Most south
facing coastlines should remain on the cooler 70s, less so on
Sat with a prevailing W-NW flow, more so on Sunday as a 10-15 kt
S sea breeze develops in the afternoon. An approaching shortwave
trough could get close enough to yield a slight chance of
showers by late day Sunday west of the Hudson River.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The upper ridge flattens Sunday night into Monday as a shortwave
approaches from the west. Associated weak low center is progged
to pass not too far south of us during this period. Chance of
showers with this system through Monday morning, with the
highest overall chances for southern sections.

Heights aloft recover somewhat in the wake of the shortwave
Monday night and Tuesday before falling slowly on Wednesday.
Mainly dry through this period with subsidence and capping, but
cannot rule out a shower north and west of the city Tuesday and
Wednesday afternoons where there`s a chance of a little CAPE
building. A better chance of showers and thunderstorms arrives
on Thursday with the approach of a cold front and pre-frontal
trough.

NBM was used for temperatures. Each day will feature highs above
normal, ranging mostly from the mid 70s to lower 80s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /09Z FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure builds in today.

VFR. N-NNW winds around 10kt through the morning push,
increasing slightly thereafter with gusts 16-20kt. Winds back
westerly for some coastal terminals during the afternoon. NW
winds under 10kt tonight.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Gusts might be only occasional. Winds should prevail north of
310 magnetic through the morning, then a chance that KEWR
occasionally shifts south of 310 from approx 18z through the
rest of the afternoon. KJFK should prevail south of 310 after
around 21z, but may occasionally shift south of that as early as
around 18z. Chance that KJFK does not shift south late day/early
evening with a sea breeze.

OUTLOOK FOR 09Z SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...

Late tonight through Sunday: VFR.

Monday: Showers and MVFR possible in the morning, then VFR.

Tuesday: MVFR or lower cond possible in afternoon/early evening
showers, mainly NW of the NYC metro terminals.
