Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
323 PM PDT Tue Sep 24 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weather system will move across the region on
Wednesday, bringing more widespread rain, breezy winds, and a
chance of isolated thunderstorms to the area. Another system will
move into the region Thursday night into Friday, before conditions
dry out over the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Temperatures rebounded
nicely today after widespread morning fog. Highs are mainly in
the 70s this afternoon with 60s near the water. Expect a quiet
night tonight with increasing clouds and lows in the 50s.

Wednesday brings more fall-like weather as the ridge exits east
and a trough moves inland. Temps will be back in the 60s and
cooler than normal. We may see a little light prefrontal precip
during the morning, then rain increasing through the afternoon as
the main frontal band moves in. The air mass is slightly unstable
over and near the Cascades where isolated thunderstorms are
possible. Showers will shift toward the King/Snohomish line during
the evening with a strong onshore push and setup for a Puget Sound
convergence zone.

We`ll see a brief break on Thursday, then more rain and wind
moving through the region heading into Thursday night and early
Friday. Again, more widespread rainfall amounts for the whole
region with wetting rains in the mountains. Winds will be breezy
overnight Thursday along the North Coast and North Interior with S
gusts to 30-40 MPH. 33

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The weekend forecast, for
now, is looking cool but quiet with weak troughing over the
region. Not much moisture or forcing over the region with
generally dry conditions. Highs will reach the lower to mid 60s
with lows in the 40s and 50s. Broad high pressure covers the Pac
NW moving into early next week, keeping the weather mild. Rain
returns Monday night or Tuesday as the ridge pushes east. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Skies have cleared to widespread VFR conditions with a
few low clouds lingering over the Strait of Juan de Fuca and some
mid to high clouds streaming into the north. MFR to IFR ceilings
expected to return to area terminals this evening along the coast
then through the interior after 06/07Z. Light north/northeast low
level winds will gradually back to the south to southwest across the
area after 06z this evening ahead of approaching frontal system.
This system will bring light rain to the area Wednesday with breezy
to gusty winds.

KSEA...VFR conditions will linger into the early morning with
stratus expected to redevelop 9/10Z - 1500 to 2500 feet, with a 70%
chance of ceilings below 1000 feet after 12Z. Northerly surface
winds 4-6 knots will return to southerly late tonight building to 8-
10 kt by late morning. Light rain should move into the terminal by
19Z.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure will linger over the coastal
waters this evening with northerly/onshore winds and seas over the
coastal waters generally 7 to 9 ft. A relatively strong frontal
system on track to bring backing winds to south-southwest late
tonight into Wednesday followed by northwest winds behind the front.
The resulting push of westerlies through Strait of Juan de Fuca is
expected to bring small craft winds, 20 to 30 kt, with around a 20
percent chance of gusts hitting 34 knots or greater. Seas are
expected to come up a bit to 9 to 10 ft with this front as well.
Another, what continues to look stronger, front is expected to
follow on the heels of the first - moving into area waters late
Thursday. This will bring another round of stronger winds with a
higher likelihood of gusty southeasterlies ahead of the front
followed by another strong push through the Strait of Juan de Fuca
during the afternoon and evening hours. Seas are expected to build
further with this system - into the 13 to 16 ft range over the outer
coastal waters Friday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
