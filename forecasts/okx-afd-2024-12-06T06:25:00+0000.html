Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
125 AM EST Fri Dec 6 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will dominate through the weekend, although a
developing warm front may pass through or nearby to our north
Saturday night into Sunday. A storm system may then bring a series
of weak troughs or warm fronts Monday through Wednesday before
dragging a cold front through during Wednesday into Wednesday night.
High pressure then builds back in on Thursday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM THIS MORNING/...
Continued to lower winds speeds based on current observations.
This has prompted the cancellation of the Wind Advisory. There
may be isolated gusts that reach advisory criteria over the next
couple of hours, but it is not expected to be widespread.
Otherwise, look for dry, breezy, chilly conditions for the rest
of the night.

Polar upper low slides through northern New England tonight,
with associated trough axis crossing this evening. At the
surface, secondary cold front passes though by early evening
with reinforcing shot of cold air and invigoration of WNW winds.

BUFKIT soundings and HRRR wind gusts continued to suggest 20-30
gusts 45-50 mph through this evening, with occasional 30-35 with
gusts to 55 mph behind reinforcing cold frontal passage. Wind
Advisory remains in place for the entire area through 10pm.
Winds gradually come down overnight as pressure gradient
gradually weakens and low level lapse rates stabilizes, closer
to 15-20 gusts to 30-35 mph by early Friday Am.

Dry conditions expected overnight, with sct to locally bkn
strato cu under cyclonic flow.

Coldest wind chills of the season so far late tonight into
early Fri morning, with lower to mid teens for city/coast and
single digits interior.

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM THIS MORNING THROUGH 6 PM SATURDAY/...
Deep upper trough remains over the region on Friday, with
cyclonic flow around intense Nova Scotia low Friday AM giving
way to surface ridging building in from the SW late Fri/ Fri
Night.

Cold advection continues on gusty WNW flow (15-25 mph with
gusts of 30-35 mph) through the day Friday, with surface temps
likely hard pressed to get out of the 20s interior and above
freezing for the city/coast with 850mb temps dropping to close
to -15c. Windchills only rising into the upper teens interior
and lower 20s city/coast.

Otherwise, scattered to locally bkn strato-cu under slow to
relent cyclonic flow and approach of late day backside
shortwave/surface trough.

Winds slowly subside Fri Night with high pressure building to
the southwest, but still appears to be enough of a gradient and
low- level mixing to preclude widespread radiational cooling.
Most places will get down into the lower 20s, with upper teens
interior, and mid 20s for NYC/NJ metro. Windchills once again
dropping into the lower to mid teens.

&&

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...
Key Points:

 * Chilly, dry Saturday.
 * Warming Sunday into next week.
 * Next round of rain on Monday.
 * Another shot of getting wet mid-week, next week. Low chances for
   frozen precip.

Heights aloft gradually rise through the weekend as a ridge builds
in from the west. Winds remain from the west 10-15 mph on Saturday,
gusting 15-20 mph. Cold air remains aloft, with highs only expected
to be in the mid-30s to around 40 with lows Saturday night in the
low-20s to low-30s. Saturday remains mostly sunny, but cloud cover
increases Saturday night as gradual warm air advection starts up at
850mb.

A weak surface low passes to the north in Canada on Sunday. Its far
enough removed from the area for most of us to remain dry, but a few
isolated light snow showers are possible for northern interior
locations closer to the low on Sunday. No accumulation expected.
Highs on Sunday will be in the mid-40s to low-50s with lows in the
upper-20s for the northern interior to near 40 for southern coastal
locations.

As a ridge centers over the region on Monday, as small shortwave
trough embedded within the the longwave ridge with pass through on
Monday. This occurs in tandem with a warm front advecting in
moisture from a low in the lower plains and gulf states as another
low deepens over the northern Great Lakes. Rain showers look likely
across the area due to warmer temperatures in place following the
warm frontal passage. The rain will taper Monday evening and early
night west to east.

Tuesday night into Wednesday night a trough approaches from the
west, which also pulls in a low from the souther plains and brings
it across the northeast. Widespread showers look likely, particularly
ahead of and along a frontal passage. Model guidance still varies on
the timing of the front, so exact timing for the best chance of
showers is still lower confidence, but the chance for rain looks
good. Warmer temperatures in place will prevent chances for frozen
precipitation until the exit of the front where a window of
opportunity for frozen precip is possible in the interior Wednesday
night. This, however, is still subject to change given this is at
the end of the forecast period.

&&

.AVIATION /06Z FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
The terminals will remain between strong low pressure to the
northeast and high pressure to the south and west through Friday.

<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Gale warnings continue on the ocean waters through the pre-dawn
hours. SCA will be needed thereafter through at least tonight

For the remaining waters, SCA conds through tonight, but there
still may be a gust or two up to 35 kt over eastern LI Sound and
Gardiner`s Bay before sunrise today.

A brief period of sub-advisory conditions for all waters
Saturday evening, then winds increase again late at night into
Sunday with SCA conds redeveloping, especially on the ocean.
Improving conditions for Sunday night, but some parts of the
ocean may still be at advisory thresholds through the entire
night.
