Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
322 AM PDT Tue Jun 10 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weakening upper level ridge over the region and
increasing onshore flow will produce cooler temperatures across
the area today. A weak upper trough will approach Western
Washington on Wednesday then settle over the area into early next
week. This will lead to cooler temperatures, increased cloud
cover, and occasional chances for mountain showers and coastal
drizzle.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow continues to
increase as thermally induced low pressure shifts east of the
Cascades and upper ridging overhead weakens. The HQM/SEA gradient
is over 2 millibars early this morning with marine air flooding
inland as noted by some gusty winds at Shelton earlier with
stratus spreading inland through the Chehalis Gap. High
temperatures across much of the interior will be some 10 degrees
or more cooler over yesterdays high temps while coastal areas may
struggle to get north of 60 F. The cooling continues into
Wednesday as low level onshore flow increases yet further ahead
of a weak upper trough. Some stratus will likely make it into the
interior lowlands on Wednesday morning and high temperatures will
drop several more degrees with highs around Puget Sound mostly
within a couple degrees either side of 70. A weak upper trough
axis will swing onshore during the day on Thursday. At this time,
it still appears to remain mostly dry. Though it will likely
produce mostly cloudy skies, slightly below normal temperatures,
and a couple of mountain showers and/or coastal drizzle.


.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...A mean upper trough position
remains just offshore Friday into early next week with a series of
weak disturbances rotating onshore. This will produce little in
the way of impacts for the area with temperatures trending a
little below normal. Some of the Euro ensembles try to bring a
more significant trough onshore just beyond the 7 day period, but
this is notably absent from much of the GFS ensembles which lends
a fairly high degree of uncertainty to the forecast much of next
week. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Zonal flow aloft becoming southwesterly Wednesday
morning with weak upper level trough approaching the area. Low
level onshore flow increasing late this afternoon into early
Wednesday morning.

IFR stratus along the central coast extending over the Lower
Chehalis Valley will continue to slowly spread east making it as
far as Pierce county by 13z. The stratus will dissipate 16z-19z.
Slightly stronger onshore flow Wednesday morning will push the
stratus as far east as the Central Sound for a few hours between
12z-18z. Outside of the stratus mostly clear skies.

KSEA...Mostly clear skies. Good chance IFR stratus reaches the
terminal for a couple of hours Wednesday morning. South wind 4 to
6 knots becoming westerly 4 to 8 knots 18z-21z and northwesterly
21z-03z. Winds returning to southwesterly by 06z. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure over the offshore waters with lower
pressure inland through the week. High pressure will build over
the waters Saturday. Northwesterly flow will persist over the
coastal waters the next several days. Diurnal westerly pushes
across the Strait expected in the evening hours through the
period.

Small craft advisory northwesterly winds over the outer coastal
waters with seas 10 to 13 feet through at least Friday. Winds and
seas slowly subsiding Friday night into the weekend.

Small craft advisory today for the inner coastal waters for 10
foot seas. Seas subsiding tonight into Wednesday.

Gale watch for the Central and Eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca for
westerly winds possibly as high as 35 knots Wednesday evening.
