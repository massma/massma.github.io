.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge over the area today and tonight
moving east Monday. Upper level trough dropping down from the
Gulf of Alaska moving through Monday night into Tuesday morning.
Stronger upper level ridge building over the area Tuesday night.
The ridge will remain over the area through the weekend. Low level
flow going offshore later Thursday into Friday pushing high
temperatures above normal.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows flat
upper level ridge building over Western Washington early this
morning. Doppler radar has a few fizzling showers over the North
and Central Cascades. Cloudy skies over the area with some holes
in the cloud cover over the South Puget Sound. Temperatures at 3
am/10z were in the 50s.

Flat upper level ridge continuing to build over Western Washington
today. Low level flow has gone light overnight. This plus a deep
layer of low level moisture will keep skies cloudy over Western
Washington this morning. Eventually the subsidence from the ridge
and the late August sun ( note the sun this time of year is
equivalent to late April sunshine ) will dissipate the low level
moisture leaving partly to mostly sunny skies by mid afternoon.
With the subsidence and the deep layer of low level moisture could
see some areas of drizzle get squeezed out of the layer this
morning. Temperatures getting a slow start with the cloud cover.
Even with the upper level ridge overhead highs a little below
normal, in the mid 60s to lower 70s.

Flat upper level ridge remaining over the area tonight. Upper
level trough moving out of the Gulf of Alaska moving a little
faster than previous model runs. The trough will still be north of
Vancouver Island by 12z Monday but that will be close enough to
throw some high clouds over at least the northwest portion of the
area. Lows tonight in the 50s.

Upper level ridge moving east Monday with the upper level trough
axis reaching the offshore waters by 00z Tuesday. Showers out
ahead of the trough spreading over the northwest portion of the
area in the afternoon with the highest pops along the north coast.
Highs a little warmer with filtered sunshine in the morning and
increasing clouds in the afternoon, in the mid 60s to mid 70s.

Upper level trough axis moving inland late Monday night with
showers spreading across the entire area. Lows in the mid 50s.

Trough axis east of Western Washington Tuesday afternoon with
shower activity coming to an end for the most part in the morning.
Good onshore push behind the trough giving breezy/windy
conditions near the Strait of Juan de Fuca and over the Northwest
Interior. Skies clearing somewhat in the afternoon but with the
cooler air mass still over the area highs only in the 60s.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Models continuing with
the scenario of a stronger upper level ridge building over Western
Washington beginning Tuesday night. Ridge remaining over the area
through the weekend. 500 mb heights in the mid to upper 580 dms.
Thermally induced surface trough moving up the Oregon coast
Thursday making it to the Washington coast Friday. This will turn
the low level flow offshore and push high temperatures above
normal Friday and Saturday, in the mid 70s to mid 80s. Highs
Wednesday in the mid 60s to mid 70s, Thursday 70s and lower 80s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge will build into Western Washington
today with north to northwesterly flow aloft continuing. Low level
moisture remains in place west of the Cascade crest with widespread
low MVFR or IFR ceilings. Conditions will gradually improve with low
level moisture scattering out and VFR conditions developing for most
of the region by 20Z-22Z.

KSEA...Low MVFR or occasional IFR ceilings in residual low level
moisture will persist through 18Z then gradual lift to VFR near or
after 20Z. Surface winds light S/SW through this morning then
veering to light northerly by this evening.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak surface ridging will build across the waters today
before shifting inland Monday morning ahead of an approaching weak
frontal system. Increasing onshore flow behind the front on Tuesday
will likely lead to some headlines for the coastal waters and
portions of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Additionally, persistent
post-frontal northwest winds over the coastal waters will lead to
some choppy conditions as we approach mid-week. A more typical late
summer pattern develops for the second half of the week as broad
surface ridging strengthens over the offshore waters and thermally
induced low pressure deepens over the Inland Northwest. This will
lead to diurnally driven increases in onshore flow.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.CLIMATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Friday and Saturday in Seattle tied the record for the
coldest back to back days in August since records started at
