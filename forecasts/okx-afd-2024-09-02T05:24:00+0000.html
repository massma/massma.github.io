Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
124 AM EDT Mon Sep 2 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
A cold front passes across the area tonight. High pressure will
then build east through the middle of the week, gradually
moving offshore mid to late next week. A frontal system may
approach the area Friday into next weekend.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM THIS MORNING/...
Forecast remains on track this evening. A cold front just NW of
the area will swing through overnight. No additional showers are
expected as the atmosphere has dried out considerably. There is
some lingering low level moisture along the south fork of Long
Island and southeast Connecticut that has led to some low clouds
and/or patchy fog. Increasing flow with the frontal passage
should erode this moisture. Breezy N/NW winds behind the front
will bring in a much drier air mass to start the week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM THIS MORNING THROUGH 6 PM TUESDAY/...
Northern stream trough will slowly slide over the region Monday into
Monday Night and gradually east on Tuesday. At the surface,
high pressure gradually build in from the west on Monday and
then overhead on Tuesday.

Dry and seasonably warm conditions on Monday with gusty N/NW winds
and sct aft/eve cu development ahead of approaching secondary cold
front. Secondary cold front crosses Mon eve with reinforcing
short of Canadian airmass. The mixed low-levels should keep
temps from radiatively bottoming out, but still lows in the 40s
across outlying areas and 50s NYC/NJ metro.

Sunny and slightly below seasonable temps on Tuesday as heart of
Canadian airmass settles over the region.

&&

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...
High pressure moves overhead Tuesday night into Wednesday morning,
then gradually pushes offshore Wednesday night into Thursday. Skies
are expected to be clear to mostly clear during this time frame. The
high remains offshore Friday leading to a return flow from the
south, which means increasing temperatures and dewpoints late next
week and an increase in cloud cover.

Conditions look to become unsettled next weekend as a frontal system
approaches from the west. At the same time, low pressure develops
along an old frontal boundary to the south, which also may approach
the area. Guidance still varies in timing and placement of these
systems. The 12Z GFS and GDPS bring the coastal low over the area
while the 12Z ICON keeps it far out to sea. The 12Z ECMWF develops
two coastal lows, kicking one out to sea, then another up the east
coast. Ensembles also vary, with some bringing a coastal low up the
coast into our area while others keep it far out to sea. Until this
event comes more into focus, exact impacts will be hard to pinpoint.

Highs during the long term will be in the 70s. Lows Tuesday night
into Wednesday morning will dip into the upper-40s in the interior
and into the 50s almost everywhere else. Thereafter, overnight lows
are expected to warm to the 50s and 60s by the weekend due to
increased cloud cover, warm advection, and a more humid air mass in
place.

.AVIATION /06Z MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front was passing through the region at 05Z, from
southeastern New England and into the New York City metro area,
and into southeastern Pennsylvania. High pressure builds in
slowly from the west through Monday night.

VFR. Any lingering IFR fog at KGON at the beginning of the
forecast period will quickly improve as drier air moves into the
region behind a cold front.

Winds will be NW to N behind a cold front, with initial cold
frontal passage wind gusts 17kt to 23kt. Gusts redevelop early
in the morning, 12Z to 14Z, increasing to around 20kt, and then
end during the evening. Timing of the onset and ending of the
gusts may be off an hour or two.


 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Timing of beginning and ending of gusts may be off by 1-2
hours.


OUTLOOK FOR 06Z TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...

Late Monday Night-Thursday: VFR.

Friday: VFR. A slight chance of a late day shower.
