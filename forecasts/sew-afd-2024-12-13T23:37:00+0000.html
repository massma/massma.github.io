Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
337 PM PST Fri Dec 13 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong frontal system moving into Western Washington
tonight and Saturday will produce gusty winds, lowland rain,
mountain snow, and high surf conditions. Coastal flooding is
expected to impact the shorelines throughout the weekend. A series
of additional frontal systems will cross the area into the middle
of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light rain continues to
gradually spread northward across the area this afternoon ahead of
an approaching frontal system and associated surface low offshore.
The surface low, now about 400 nautical miles west of Astoria,
will continue to deepen overnight as it lifts northeastward. As it
moves into the Washington offshore waters tonight, gradients will
begin to increase...reaching -8 to -10 millibars between Astoria
and Quillayute by Saturday morning. The surface low is expected to
make landfall over central Vancouver Island by late Saturday
morning as an occluded front sweeps inland across Western
Washington. The strongest winds with this system are expected
along the coast and across interior areas from around Everett
northward. This system will generate high surf along the coast
with seas reaching around 20 feet by mid-morning Saturday. All of
this will coincide with Perigean Spring Tides and inundation of
2.5 to 3.5 feet above ground level on Saturday...for the potential
of major coastal flooding along the coast and moderate coastal
flooding along the strait and San Juans.

Snow levels will gradually fall through the weekend...starting
near 3500 feet tonight and falling to 2000 to 2500 feet by Sunday.
Several inches of snow will fall at the passes where a Winter
Weather Advisory remains in place. Without any strong post-frontal
onshore punch over the weekend, this should limit snowfall totals
in the central Cascades passes, but we`ll need to keep on eye on
Mount Baker where orographics could play a big role. Shortwave
ridging will slide inland on Sunday for a brief transition to
somewhat drier and colder conditions. Another frontal system is
expected to move onshore on Monday, but this system looks to
weaken as it moves onshore as upper level support remains
offshore.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...A rather active pattern is
expected to persist through early next week, but confidence in
timing and any potential impacts is relatively low. The general
trend in the ensembles is to build an upper level ridge over the
Intermountain West by the middle portion of next week. But therein
lies the rub. This places Western Washington on the periphery of
said ridge...and somewhat susceptible to a potential atmospheric
river. The 12Z ECMWF ensembles have keyed in on this, but other
model ensembles are less enthusiastic. For now, the 7 forecast
period is shaping up to end quieter than it began. But in
December, that`s easily subject to change. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow over western Washington as an upper level
trough approaches the area. Rain has filled in through the interior
of western Washington, bringing with it locally lower ceilings and
visibility restrictions of 3 to 6 SM at times. These conditions will
persist through the early evening hours before tapering off into
showers that will remain through the TAF period. Ceilings are mostly
in the high MVFR to low-end VFR conditions are expected to mostly
stay in that range through the evening with more widespread VFR re-
emerging early Saturday morning.

Southeast winds will continue to increase, peaking Saturday morning
and becoming more due southerly. Winds will peak around 15 to 25 kt
with gusts ranging from 25 to 45 kt. The highest gusts will be local
to the Pacific coast and the northern interior terminals (including
PAE and BLI). Winds will continue to veer to southwesterly but begin
to decrease getting into Saturday afternoon.

KSEA...VFR conditions this afternoon with rain over the area. CIGs
are expected to remain in the high-end MVFR to low-end VFR range
through most of the TAF period. This evening, some visibility
restrictions to 3-5 SM remain possible. Southeast winds will
continue to increase up to 15 to 20 kt with gusts 25 to 30 kt
possible around the time peak of winds which is expected Saturday
morning. Winds will veer southerly then southwesterly through the
day while also decreasing.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong low pressure system centered about 400 miles off
the coast of Washington will continue to move northeastward towards
central Vancouver Island on Saturday, bringing a very active period
of weather for the area. Along the coast, winds will continue to
increase today up to gale force through Saturday morning and will
begin to diminish Saturday afternoon. Gusts up to 50 kt/storm force
are likely during this time period, especially through the outer
coastal waters.

Winds are already at Small Craft Advisory threshold through portions
of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Southeast winds are expected to
increase to gale force through the East and West Entrances, as well
as through Admiralty Inlet and the Northern Inland Waters. Winds
will also increase through Puget Sound and Hood Canal reaching SCA
criteria.

Winds will begin to ease area-wide Saturday afternoon into Saturday
evening. The calm period will be short lived as another frontal
system will move through the waters Sunday night into Monday where
another round of strong winds through the coastal waters,
potentially reaching gale force through the outer coastal waters (40-
60% probability). Additional systems may move through the area mid-
week keeping conditions active over the area waters.

Seas 10 to 12 ft this afternoon will rapidly rise to 18 to 23 ft
across the area waters tonight. Waves remain over 20 ft through the
coastal waters through Saturday afternoon before subsiding below 10
ft on Sunday. The frontal system Sunday night bring waves back up to
8 to 12 ft by Monday and look to remain above 10 ft through much of
the beginning of next week.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A stronger storm will move through the area tonight
and into this weekend, for chances of more significant precipitation
to the region. Latest guidance still has been uncertain regarding
rainfall amounts in the Olympics, with overall totals being a
touch higher than previous forecasts. Area rivers will still
rise, with only the Skokomish River being expected to reach near
action stage. Even with the slightly higher QPF amounts, the
Skokomish River still is forecasted to barely reach action stage
on Saturday. This will continued to be monitored as more guidance
becomes available. Additional rounds of precipitation could keep
the Skokomish river at or near flood stage into early next week.
We will continue to monitor the rainfall forecast and the river
forecast for this weekend.
