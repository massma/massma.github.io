.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showers will continue through today, becoming a bit
steadier this afternoon into this evening with an additional
frontal system moving across Western Washington. Breezy south
winds are expected today around Admiralty Inlet and Whidbey
Island, with gusts of 20 to 35 MPH. Otherwise, highs will be in
the mid to upper 50s for most areas. No major forecast updates
this morning.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...Front moving through Western Washington tonight with
rain out ahead of the system spreading over the area today. Upper
level trough behind the front Monday with the trough axis moving
through Tuesday. Upper level ridge trying to build Wednesday. Next
system arriving late Thursday with another upper level trough
behind it for Friday.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Satellite imagery shows weak
front moving into Western Washington this morning with another
front on its heels back near 130W. Lots of precipitation echoes on
the doppler radar but most of the rain is not making it to the
surface. Mild temperatures at 3 am/10z, mostly in the lower to mid
50s.

First system over the area this morning will continue to stretch
out and weaken with a little light rain over the area. Second
system near the coast by late afternoon with more consolidated and
widespread rain over Western Washington this afternoon. Little
change in temperatures with highs near the current readings.

Front moving through the area this evening with rain giving way
to showers after midnight. Could see a brief convergence zone east
of the Strait of Juan de Fuca mid evening but even if one forms
it will not last very long. Lows tonight in the mid to upper 40s.

Upper level trough over Western Washington Monday and Monday night
keeping showers in the forecast. High and low temperatures will be
a couple of degrees cooler than today, mostly mid 50s for highs
and lower to mid 40s for lows.

Upper level trough axis moving through Western Washington Tuesday
with an organized band of showers moving through the area midday
into the afternoon hours. Increasing onshore flow behind the
trough axis giving the area some breezy conditions with southerly
wind gusts as high as 30 mph. Convergence zone forming over
Snohomish county in the afternoon. Air mass unstable enough
behind the trough axis for a slight chance of thunderstorms along
the coast. Highs in the lower to mid 50s.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Upper level ridge
trying to build over Western Washington Wednesday. Ridge not very
impressive with 500 mb heights in the lower to mid 560 dms. Will
keep a chance of showers in the forecast.

Extended models showing good consistency bringing another system
into the area Thursday night with rain out ahead of the front
moving over the area mostly in the afternoon. Elevated snow levels
will keep the precipitation type as rain in the passes.

Trailing upper level trough moving into Western Washington Friday
keeping showers in the forecast.

Model consistency breaks down Saturday with the ECMWF showing a
weakening system moving down from the northwest approaching the
area while the operational GFS has a front spinning out of a cool
upper level low moving into Western Washington. ECMWF ensembles
hold the system together better than the operational run while the
GFS ensembles are weaker with the front than the operational run.
With the uncertainty will just go with chance pops.

Temperatures a little above normal the first couple of days, highs
in the mid 50s to mid 60s, cooling to a little below normal, in
the lower to mid 50s for Friday and Saturday. Felton

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A trough over the NE PAC will bring SW flow aloft
throughout the period. A front offshore will slowly move inland
today and tonight for an extended period of rain showers through
tonight into early Monday. Ceilings this morning are VFR, except
MVFR along the coast. Expect MVFR conditions to slowly move inland
with the front, with MVFR reaching the interior terminals around 21Z
Sun-00Z Mon, both with ceilings and limitations in visibility,
particularly in heavier rain showers. IFR conditions are expected to
develop along the coast and persist into tonight. The system does
not look to traverse the area until Monday afternoon, keeping
ceilings MVFR or lower through the rest of the TAF period.

Winds are calm to light offshore this morning. Expect winds to pick
up a little bit today as the front gets closer, with winds south to
southwesterly 5 to 10 kt and remain like so tonight.

KSEA...VFR conditions this morning look to continue into the early
afternoon, with MVFR conditions arriving between around 21Z Sun-00Z
Mon with bands of rain moving over the terminal through today and
into tonight. Variable winds this morning becoming S-SW winds 5-10
kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system will track across area waters today.
Sustained winds are to remain below advisory criteria but can`t rule
out isolated wind gusts near SCA for the coastal waters and East
Strait. Nevertheless, a SCA remains in effect over the coastal
waters for seas. Additional disturbances will traverse the area for
both Monday and Tuesday. Brief high pressure second half of
Wednesday into Thursday before the next area of low pressure enters
Thursday night.

Seas increasing to 10-11 ft today, starting at the outer coastal
waters first this morning. Seas are to remain elevated around 9-10
ft through Tuesday before easing to around 5 to 7 ft on Wednesday
and Thursday.

.HYDROLOGY...Rainfall amounts over the Olympics in the next 72
hours have decreased in the 00z model run. The elevated snow
levels are still a little worrisome so can`t rule out the
Skokomish River getting to flood stage Wednesday morning. Right
now the forecast has the river cresting about a half a foot below
flood stage.

No river flooding expected on the remainder of the rivers for the
next 7 days. Felton
