Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
236 AM PDT Mon Apr 14 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will dominate across western Washington
this week. It will remain dry through the work week with a mix of
clouds and sun across the region. The warmest days this week will
be Monday and Friday, with highs topping out these days in the
upper 60s to low 70s. Next chance of regionwide showers will come
next weekend with a possible disturbance.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>It is very quiet across
western WA this morning. Upper air analysis shows a decently-
sized upper level ridge spanning from the northwestern CONUS up to
Yukon in Canada. The jet streak with the cooler air has moved
east of our side of the state. There is some high level
cirrus/cirrostratus this morning on the satellite. Temperatures
are a bit warmer this morning compared to yesterday - most areas
will have lows come down to around 40 this morning.

The ridge axis will line up over western WA today over a thermal
trough along the coast. Gradients are quite weak and skies today
will be mostly clear to partly cloudy (more clouds to the north).
Keeping all of this in mind, the high temps today were forecasted
towards the 90th percentile of the NBM. Assuming any cloud
coverage does not hinder daytime heating today, a bunch of lowland
areas will see temperatures from 68 to 72 today (from Seattle
metro through Chehalis and over to Hoquiam).

Tuesday will see the ridge axis move east of the region, with weak
flow aloft. Close dew point depressions Tuesday and Wednesday
morning (along with weak north winds) suggests possible patchy
fog in parts of the Southwest Interior each morning (could be a
couple isolated pockets scattered elsewhere in the region).
Temperatures will cool off a few degrees on Tuesday and Wednesday,
transitioning to low to mid 60s for highs. The trough that was
expected to graze the Cascades Wednesday has shifted a bit more
east in this morning`s update. As a result, there are no longer
PoPs for showers in the Cascades on Wednesday, and we`ll continue
to see the mix of clouds/clear skies in the short term.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Another ridge will drop
down from Alaska into the area second half of the week. The
warmest day will be on Friday as the axis tilts northeastward over
WA (again low 70s will be possible). The ensembles point to the
warmer anomalies breaking down, and being replaced with slightly
cooler ones by early next week. It does appear (as we get back to
spring with the April showers), that the next chance of
possible precipitation for a large size of the coverage area will
come next weekend with a chance of showers.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge moving over the region today
will allow for northerly flow to become more west/southwesterly by
this afternoon. VFR conditions persist across the terminals early
this morning, with satellite showing some mid to high cloud cover
streaming in overhead. Expect high cloud cover to increase today,
especially for northern terminals like KBLI and KCLM as a weak,
dissipating front slowly approaches the region.

Surface winds for the majority of the area terminals will remain
northerly today, persisting at 7-12 kt, especially throughout the
afternoon and evening hours. KCLM and KHQM will see surface winds
initially take on more of an NE/E component as a thermal trough
builds northward along the coast this morning. VFR conditions
expected to prevail throughout the day, though some patchy fog
will be possible for terminals along the coast and south Sound by
early Tuesday morning.

KSEA...VFR conditions early this morning with scattered high cloud
cover. Expect conditions to remain VFR through the TAF period. N
winds will persist at 7-12 kt through the day.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A thermal trough building northward along the Washington
coast today will allow for a brief period of offshore flow to
develop across portions of the area waters this morning. The
trough will push inland this afternoon and evening as a weakening
front approaches the region. N/NW winds across the coastal waters
will increase this afternoon and evening, with gusts to 25-30 kt
possible at times. High pressure building into the northeastern
Pacific in the wake of the front will remain situated over the
region through much of the week and will interact with lower
pressure inland. This will allow for N/NW winds to persist across
the coastal waters over the next several days and could result in
additional small craft headlines at times.

Combined seas over the coastal waters will range between 4-6 ft
today, before they start to build towards 10-13 ft Tuesday. Seas
for the outermost coastal waters will likely build towards 14 ft
late Tuesday into Wednesday. Seas then look to gradually subside
back towards 4-6 ft again by Thursday.
