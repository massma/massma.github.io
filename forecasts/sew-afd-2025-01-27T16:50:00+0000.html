Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
850 AM PST Mon Jan 27 2025

.SYNOPSIS...An upper level ridge centered offshore will gradually
build into the region through the early portion of the week. This
will lead to dry conditions and chilly overnight temperatures.
The ridge will weaken by midweek and a series of systems will
bring a return of lowland rain and mountain snow Friday into the
weekend, with a threat of lowland moving into next week.

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Another chilly and calm morning across western
Washington. The main focus today will be on the return to more
active weather late this week into early next week. The short term
forecast is in good shape and no updates are planned.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...High pressure remains
dominant across the Pacific NW with dry and stable weather
continuing. Expect chilly morning temperatures in the 20s and 30s
each morning with highs mainly in the 40s. Offshore winds will
keep skies clear with plenty of sunshine. 33

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...The ridge starts to
weaken/flatten by Thursday as a trough moves in from the west.
This system will spread light warm frontal precip to the region
Thursday night with the main cold frontal band moving inland early
Friday. A flip to onshore flow will keep lowland temps above
freezing with rain expected. Up in the mountains, snow levels
hover around 3,000-4,000 ft with a few inches of snow in the
Cascades and passes. Mountain snow may be heavy at times Friday
night as the trough axis passes.

A cool upper level trough keeps snow levels low on Saturday and
there`s a rain/snow mix possible in the lowlands (although NBM
probabilities of an inch or more are generally low). Lowland snow
threats continue into early next week as the cool upper low stalls
and spins offshore. Minor to moderate winter storm impacts are
possible depending on how much moisture streams in. 33

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge will remain centered offshore
resulting in northerly flow aloft today. As the center of high
pressure drifts southward tonight, flow aloft will shift to become
more northwesterly for Tuesday. At the surface, offshore flow will
continue with gradients relaxing through the day and into Tuesday,
resulting in widespread wind speeds of 5 kts or less.

Widespread VFR conditions in place and look to remain that way for
the majority of the TAF period, with some fog development at KPWT
and KCLM. Given how prone these sites are to such development,
persistence forecasting seems reasonable at this time. These two
sites could see fog re- emerge late tonight/early Tuesday morning.

KSEA...VFR conditions to persist throughout the TAF period.
Winds mostly north to northeasterly with speeds under 5 kts this
morning with a shift to more northerly this afternoon. This might
give speeds a slight boost, but even then do not expect speeds to
exceed the 4-8 kts range.

.MARINE...Surface high pressure over the offshore waters and
over Eastern Washington with a weak surface trough along the coast
through Tuesday. Both areas of high pressure will weaken Wednesday
and Wednesday night. Next front moving through the waters Thursday
night and Friday morning. Possible small craft advisory winds with
the front over the coastal waters.

Seas generally 3-5 ft through at least midweek, rising to 6 to 8 ft
by the end of the week and remaining there for the remainder of the
forecast period as weather becomes more active.
