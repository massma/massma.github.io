Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
215 PM PST Sun Mar 2 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A series of weak troughs will maintain near-normal
temperatures and bring several chances for light showers across
western Washington through mid-week. The pattern may turn more
active next weekend with potential for an atmospheric river to
bring significant precipitation to the Pacific Northwest, but
considerable uncertainty exists at this time.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough
will continue to slowly shift inland over northern California
today, advecting moisture northward into Washington. Most of the
moisture will materialize as increased cloud cover, with light
shower activity favored to continue today mainly south of the
Puget Sound and over the southern Cascades. Temperatures will peak
a few degrees below normal across the lowlands, with most areas
seeing highs near 50 degrees.

The upper low will shift further inland over California on
Monday, increasing onshore flow and spreading wrap around
moisture northward for continued chances for light shower
activity. Models continue to trend drier with this second wave of
moisture, with most areas across the interior seeing little more
than cloudy skies and a drizzle Monday. However, high resolution
models hint at convergence zone showers forming over the Cascades
later on Monday that may locally enhance snow accumulations. Even
still, with snow levels near 4000 ft, the higher Cascade passes
will likely see an inch or less of snow accumulation through
Monday night before shower activity tapers off.

A weak transient ridge will pass over the region Monday night into
Tuesday, allowing conditions to briefly dry out ahead of the next
incoming system. Another trough will lift a front across the
region late Tuesday into early Wednesday, spreading a round of
showers across western Washington. This system will have a bit
more moisture to work with, but will be limited by its short
duration. The lowlands will see a tenth or two of rainfall with
this system, with up to half an inch to an inch of liquid over the
mountains and along the coast. With snow levels near 3000 ft, the
Cascade passes will likely see a couple inches of accumulating
snow through Wednesday.

Even with cloud cover, these systems will keep the low-level
airmass very moist, allowing for patchy fog to develop in spots
each morning. Fog may be locally dense at times.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Ridging will build over
the Pacific Northwest on Thursday, pushing a developing trough
southward and allowing conditions to dry out across western
Washington. Forecast models are trending drier heading into
Friday, with an atmospheric river still on track to bring
significant moisture to the Pacific Northwest. However, models
continue to show uncertainty over the exact placement and amount
of rainfall on tap for next weekend. The ensemble mean favors
periods of moderate to heavy rainfall focused over the Olympic
Peninsula and northern Cascades Saturday and Sunday, with active
weather favored beyond.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak shortwave trough will swing a weakening occluded
front through the region this afternoon. A band of light showers has
been slowly tracking northward to the southern outskirts of Seattle.
Some mist will also accompany the showers (as some of the rain
evaporates on the way to the ground). Observations show MVFR
conditions across the major terminals this afternoon, with IFR
conditions north (from KPAE to KNUW to KBLI). NBM guidance shows
improvements to lower-end MVFR this afternoon in the IFR areas. The
shower activity is expected to lift northward through the afternoon
with the occluded front, but guidance is spotty in how far north it
get (some of the moisture for northern areas may come via
convergence zone later tonight/Monday morning). Ceilings will remain
MVFR (potentially IFR in some spots) rest of today into Monday. The
lowest ceilings are expected Monday morning. Winds will remain light
out of the west (and northwest) through this evening at 5 to 10 kt,
but will become light tonight into Monday morning out of the
west/southwest at 5 to 10 kt.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings have arrived with vicinity showers moving into
the terminal area this afternoon. Expect conditions to remain MVFR
through the TAF period, with lowest ceilings expected Monday morning
(20% chance of IFR conditions). Some mist with the showers may also
reduce visibilities this afternoon. Winds out of the northwest 5 to
10 kt this afternoon will become light tonight, and become
southwesterly into Monday at around 5 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak occluded front will dissipate over the waters
today. Shower activity will be possible for inland area waters, but
otherwise ceilings are not expected to drop below a few hundred
feet. The main concern this afternoon remains seas, which were still
reported to be at 10 to 11 feet this afternoon in the coastal waters
(based on buoy waters). This is on the decreases from seas this
morning, so will allow the small craft advisories to drop from inner
waters to outer waters this evening into Monday morning.

The pattern becomes more roller-coaster like with troughs and ridges
moving through the region throughout the week. The next trough on
Tuesday has the potential to produce winds in excess of 20 kt over
the coastal waters. Another potential windy spot is the East Strait
of Juan de Fuca, but the potential for winds over 20 kt is low at
this time. Otherwise, the next chance for a more organized system
that may produce widespread winds will come next weekend (continue
to monitor for a possible atmospheric river).

Expect seas to drop to 6 to 9 feet tonight/Monday through Tuesday.
The front Tuesday may produce waves up to 10 feet in parts of the
outer coastal waters, but otherwise a substantial increase above 10
feet is not expected until next weekend.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>While precipitation through Thursday will be light,
forecast models continue to highlight the potential for
significant incoming precipitation next weekend. However,
considerable uncertainty remains over exactly how much rainfall
will enter the region and where the rain will fall. The Skokomish
River is currently forecast to reach Minor Flood Stage by next
Saturday, with no other area rivers expected to flood at this
time. Changes in conditions will continue to be closely monitored.
