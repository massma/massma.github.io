Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
402 PM PST Fri Jan 10 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough will exit the region this evening,
although some lingering showers will remain possible in its wake.
This will include showers nurtured by a Puget Sound Convergence Zone
which will primarily impact the Central Cascades. Minor disturbances
along the leading edge of a building ridge will still allow for
scattered showers over the weekend. Strong ridging builds in for
next week for a return to dry conditions.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Current radar less organized
than this morning as frontal system has since departed. Two main
areas of showers to focus in on: the first out over the western half
of the CWA are much more scattered in nature and largely light...and
the second being much more organized over southern Skagit and much
of Snohomish counties thanks to continuing PSCZ. This latter batch
will be responsible for continued snow showers over the Central
Cascades. At this time, snowfall amounts there look relatively
unchanged and as such, headline looks good with no alteration needed.

Strong ridging building over the Pacific clearly displays what is to
come, but W WA will not get there yet. A series of weak impulses
along the leading edge of this ridge will still keep the prospect
for scattered showers over the area for Saturday and Sunday. PoPs
Saturday tend to favor the southern third of the CWA as well as from
the East Puget Sound Lowlands through the foothills and into the
Cascades proper...but even then remain only 30-50 pct...with
generally dry conditions expected elsewhere /maybe a 10-20 pct
chance at worst/. Sunday is even less convincing, with at best a 20
pct chance for showers. The ridge axis starts to approach the coast
Sunday night into Monday morning, placing W WA solidly under the
influence of this feature. This will be the start of an extended dry
period.

Overnight lows in the short term will be a handful of degrees cooler
in the wake of the exiting front, with temps down in the mid 30s to
around 40 both tonight and Saturday night. Sunday night cools even
more thanks to clearing associated with the ridge, with lows in the
lower to mid 30s.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Upper level ridging will hold
court over the western US for at least the first half of next week,
keeping dry conditions in place. The ridge does flatten by Thursday
morning thanks to an upper level low passing through British
Columbia. How much this impacts W WA and whether or not it brings a
return of precip is still a question with low-confidence answers.
The NBM is latching on to at least low-end PoPs /generally 10-30
pct/, so this does not appear to have too much impact on the CWA at
this time. The main benefit will be this will import clouds into the
area, which will nudge both overnight lows and daytime highs upward
slightly. Daytime highs under the ridge /Tuesday and Wednesday/ will
generally be in the mid 40s to around 50, while the remainder of the
long term will see highs in the lower to mid 40s. Conversely,
overnight lows Tuesday and Wednesday will be in the upper 20s to
lower 30s before increasing somewhat for the remainder of next week,
ranging in the lower to mid 30s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Currently a mixed bag of ceilings across
the terminals as isolated light showers continue to move across
Western Washington. Expect activity to taper off into the late
afternoon/evening hours. Satellite imagery shows a few breaks in the
clouds which has allowed some locations to bounce back between MVFR
and VFR. Guidance seem to favor MVFR conditions to become more
widespread for the rest of the the TAF period (possibly after 3Z
Saturday) with localized IFR conditions possible in the Kitsap
Peninsula. KCLM has the highest probability of perhaps seeing some
mixed VFR/MVFR conditIons. A weak band of showers has formed to the
north of PAE and to the east of BFI/SEA. High-resolution guidance
has it moving south around 0Z Saturday towards PAE, which could lead
to reduced visibility and ceilings. Based on what we are seeing on
radar, there is medium to high confidence these showers may impact
the terminal. Northerly winds for terminals east of the Sound, with
winds shifting south over the next hours.

KSEA...Radar shows some convergence zone showers to the east of the
terminal and a few fast moving light showers moving within the
vicinity. High-resolution guidance has this convergence zone showers
staying put to the east over the Cascades. However, radar imagery
seems to indicate these showers may be expanding westward toward the
terminal. Current confidence is low at this time on its westward
expansion. If these showers do expand westward, expect reduced
visibilities and ceilings, and northerly winds. Currently easterly
flow which will turn southerly after 01-02Z Saturday. MVFR ceilings
will likely persist through the TAF period.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure is building in the wake of the frontal
system that moved through this morning and will persist through the
weekend and early next week.

Gales will remain gusty through the Central and East Strait early
Saturday morning. Winds will ease Saturday across the Strait below
advisory criteria. The coastal waters will remain gusty with small
craft criteria winds and should subside below criteria on Sunday
morning. Seas will build to 10 to 15 ft tonight and will gradually
subside throughout the day on Saturday. Waves will decrease below 10
ft on Sunday and rebuild again early Monday morning above 10 ft.
Seas will subside below 10 ft again Monday afternoon and remain
below 10 ft through late next week.

The next frontal system seems to move over the coastal waters late
next week.
