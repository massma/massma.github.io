Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
321 PM PST Sat Nov 16 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong storm system moves into the region today,
maintaining gusty winds and widespread precipitation across the
area into Sunday. Unsettled conditions Sunday night and Monday.
Another strong frontal system approaches late Tuesday and pushes
through the area into Wednesday. An active pattern then likely
continues through late in the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...Steady rain continues to
advance across the region ahead of the approaching frontal system.
Snow levels initially around 2000-3000 feet early this morning
will climb significantly in the warm sector of the frontal system.
The NOAA PSL profiler at Forks has indicated a jump to around
8000 ft or so as of early this afternoon. As we continue to see
moisture moving into the region, the warmer air will bring snow
levels to around 4500 feet or so in the North Cascades and closer
to the values that we`re seeing near the coast in the far southern
Cascades. Meanwhile, gusty winds will continue to be the story
ahead of the frontal passage. Winds at NAS Whidbey Island continue
to gust to around 50-60 mph and will remain strong through the
evening. While gusts away from the eastern Strait/Admiralty Inlet
and San Juan Islands won`t be nearly as strong, widespread gusts
in to the 20-30 mph remain expected overnight.

As the front sweeps through early Sunday, a much cooler air mass
returns in behind the front and brings snow levels lowering back
down to around 3500 feet through the day Sunday and to around 2000
feet by Sunday night. This will be the push of heaviest snow
through the Cascades and the focus for the current Winter Storm
Warning which remains on track and unchanged at this time. A few
isolated thunderstorms could develop along the coast into the
afternoon as lapse rates steepen with the colder air aloft. These
could push as far east as the Olympics and Lower Chehalis Valley.

With the upper level trough still overhead into Monday, continued
showers are expected over the area. A post-frontal convergence
zone will likely develop near the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca
and extend east-southeast into the Cascades, serving as a focus
for additional showers and possibly a thunderstorm or two.

In additional to these other hazards, the combination of lower
than average pressure and higher high tides will maintain a
continued risk of coastal flooding during the higher of the high
tides each day. Meanwhile, the hydrology section will discuss
river flood potential.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Another strong frontal
system will approach the region late Tuesday as a rapidly
deepening low pressure system over the far northeastern Pacific
begins to shift toward Vancouver Island. Confidence has increased
in the potential for some stronger winds across portions of
Western Washington as this system approaches. Additionally, there
is a signal for locally heavier precipitation as this plume of
moisture focuses somewhere in the Pacific Northwest. Additionally,
while confidence is a bit lower later in the week, there remains
the potential for continued moisture through much of the week.
Various differences in when the low might cut off, would shift the
potential for a drier day toward Thursday or Friday, but not
enough of a signal to remove any mention for now. Meanwhile, snow
levels would likely remain in the generally 4000 ft range,
maintaining the potential for heavier snow in the higher Cascade
elevations later in the week.

.AVIATION...West-northwest flow aloft as an upper-ridge rounds the
region. A mix of VFR/MVFR currently as a weather system spreads
across W WA. MVFR conditions will become more widespread this
evening and overnight as steady rainfall persists. Can`t rule out
instances of IFR as well. Breezy surface winds out of the south with
gusts between 20-25 kt into early Sunday morning. Rainfall will
break into showers on Sunday along with a PSCZ in the vicinity of
KPAE. Some improvement to VFR is in the cards for Sunday, barring
shower activity overhead and the aforementioned convergence zone.


KSEA...VFR this afternoon but MVFR conditions will trend more into
the late afternoon-evening (after 23z) as rain and low clouds track
overhead. Mostly MVFR will stay in place overnight. Visibilities may
be limited at times under heavier precip rates. SE winds between 5
to 10 kt with gusts upwards of 20 to 25 kt. VFR conditions should
pick up more into the first half of the day on Sunday.

.MARINE...A frontal system will progress through the
region tonight as active weather continues. Gales remain in place
for the coast, East Entrance, and Admiralty Inlet but should be
allowed to expire this evening. The remaining SCA for inland waters
will continue before expiring into early Sunday morning also. High
seas will only replace gales along the coastal waters as wave
heights top out around 10 to 12 ft tonight into Sunday before rising
to 12 to 18 ft Sunday night and trending into early next week.
Models have been consistent in keeping an intense sub 960-millibar
surface low deepening over the offshore waters Tuesday night in the
forecast. here is uncertainty regarding the track and strength of
this system, but ensembles are hinting at the possibility of some
large seas (20+) in our coastal water zones. In addition, wind
speeds over the coastal waters may reach Storm Force criteria
Tuesday evening.

.HYDROLOGY...Another round of widespread precipitation this
weekend as a front moves through the area Sunday. Precipitation
forecasts remain similar with around 2-3.5 inches in the mountains
and 0.5-1.25 inches in the lowlands through late Sunday evening. Snow
levels will fluctuate quite rapidly, with snow levels rising up
to 4500-7000 feet tonight then back down to 2000-2500 feet Sunday
night and a little lower Monday. Expect rises on area rivers, with
the largest rises again expected on the rivers flowing off of the
Olympics. A flood warning has been issued for the Skokomish River
in Mason County, which is expected to reach flood stage early
Sunday.

A warmer air mass will arrive in the middle of the week, with some
indications of another atmospheric river setting up somewhere
over or near the region later in the week. This would have the
potential to bring steadier rain and higher snow levels, which
could lead to the potential for additional flooding late in the
week.
