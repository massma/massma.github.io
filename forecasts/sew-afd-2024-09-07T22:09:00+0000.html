Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough will swing across the Pacific
Northwest tonight and Sunday. Upper level troughing will then
remain the dominant influence over the region through much of the
next week, bringing increased onshore flow, cooler temperatures,
and some showers at times.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Smoke aloft continues to
stream into western Washington from the south, producing hazy
skies across much of the region this afternoon. Latest satellite
imagery shows some mid to high cloud cover also moving in from
the south, associated with some very weak echoes on radar. The
airmass remains dry in the low levels, so do not expect to see
much in the way of precipitation to make it to the ground. A
slight chance of isolated thunderstorms remains for portions of
the south Sound and Cascades through tonight, though latest
probabilistic guidance still shows less than a 10 percent
probability of occurrence - so confidence in this remains low.

The thickness of the smoke aloft has been impacting temperatures
across the region this afternoon. Current temperatures are
trending in the 70s across the interior and the 80s across the
Cascades. With smoke continuing to stream in overhead, have
lowered afternoon highs a few degrees and have them generally
topping out in the low 80s for the interior lowlands. Warmer
conditions are still expected for the Cascades, with temperatures
expected to top out in the upper 80s to low 90s in some spots.

An upper level trough moving into Oregon today will swing its axis
across the Pacific Northwest on Sunday, bringing increased onshore
flow and slightly cooler temperatures to western Washington. Stratus
will push a little bit further inland along the coast on Sunday
morning where afternoon temperatures are generally on track to
top out in the mid to upper 60s. Temperatures across the interior
will start to cool a few degrees as well, topping out in the upper
70s to low 80s. Elevated smoke aloft will continue to stream into
the region on Sunday, however expect slow improvement through the
day. A chance of showers and isolated thunderstorms remains
possible for the Cascades on Sunday afternoon, however confidence
in occurrence again remains low.

Flow aloft will transition to more zonal on Monday, promoting
increased onshore flow and allowing for stratus to push further
inland into the interior. Temperatures will cool as a result with
afternoon highs expected to be in the 60s and 70s. Cooler
conditions will continue into Tuesday, before an upper level
trough approaches the region Tuesday afternoon and evening.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Guidance generally
hints at upper level troughing remaining the dominant influence
across the region through much of the long term period. The
aforementioned upper trough digging offshore on Tuesday looks to
swing across the region on Wednesday and bring more widespread
shower activity back to western Washington. The trough looks to
move off to the east by Thursday afternoon, allowing for conditions
across western Washington to briefly dry back out. Guidance then
hints at another trough deepening over the northeastern Pacific
and approaching the area over the weekend. The overall pattern
will keep temperatures trending close to just below normal through
much of the extended period. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak upper level trough moving inland tonight with
high-based light showers mainly over the south and central
Cascades. Smoke aloft from wildfires but no restrictions to
surface visibility. Onshore flow brings low level stratus clouds
to the coast overnight with patchy low clouds and/or fog near the
sound by morning. Low clouds will burn back toward the coast by
18-21z. 33

KSEA...A mix of smoke and cirrus clouds aloft tonight, decreasing
on Sunday with west to southwest winds aloft. At the surface,
light N winds switching to S/SW by 06-09z tonight. Patchy low
clouds anticipated by early and mid morning with IFR to MVFR
conditions. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A thermal trough moves inland tonight with a return to
onshore flow. A stronger push Sunday night may lead to Small Craft
Advisory winds down the Strait of Juan de Fuca. A weak front cross
the waters on Monday. Weak low pressure moves through the Coastal
Waters Tuesday and Wednesday. Wave Heights generally 4 to 7 feet
through the period. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.FIRE WEATHER... <span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Hot, dry, and unstable conditions will continue
through this evening for the Olympic zones 652/661 and Cascade
zones 658/659 - where a Red Flag Warning remains in effect.
Elevated smoke and some mid to high cloud cover moving into the
region from the south has aided portions of the southern Cascades
from bottoming out into critical RH levels this afternoon,
however latest observations are still showing RHs in the low to
mid 20s across portions of the North Cascades. Isolated thunderstorms
will remain possible across portions of the South Cascades through
this evening, though confidence in this remains low with probabilistic
guidance still only showing less than a 10% chance of occurrence.

Cooler and more moist air will make a return area-wide on Sunday,
though isolated thunderstorms will again be possible across the
Cascades Sunday afternoon into evening as an upper trough swings
through. General upper troughing pattern setting up next week will
bring increased onshore flow and cloud cover, better humidity
recoveries, and the potential of some wetting rains by mid-week -
which will help mitigate fire weather conditions. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
