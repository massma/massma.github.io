.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A low pressure system remains offshore and will
gradually move south and east through Tuesday. This will maintain
some residual showers pivoting through the region today. High
pressure then returns for the next several days bringing a less
active pattern. However, temperatures will begin to trend cooler
into the weekend and shower chances will return.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Latest NWS radar imagery
depicts some scattered showers pivoting through the region early
this morning in between a low off the southern Oregon coast and a
shortwave dropping south along coastal British Columbia.
Otherwise, relatively light rinds and abundant low level moisture
is supporting low stratus and some areas of fog. Expect these low
clouds to continue through around mid-morning with some continued
showers around the region. However, the transition to high
pressure and a less active weather pattern is then expected for
the next several days as the aforementioned low off the Oregon
coast pushes away from the region. Expect increasingly dry
conditions Wednesday and into the Thanksgiving holiday, but it`s
worth noting that a few weak impulses rounding the ridge may still
support some light showers at times. As a result, have maintained
the low PoPs evident in the NBM guidance, but the associated QPF
remains quite light. That is, even if there are a few showers
around at times, these are likely to have little accumulation.
With the building high pressure, expect to see overnight lows
gradually trending cooler by Thursday.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Looking ahead to the holiday
weekend, ensemble guidance continues to suggest that the dominant
feature will remain a relatively high amplitude across the far
eastern Pacific and extending into the Pacific Northwest. Again,
there is a non-trivial subset of ensemble members that suggest a
few passing disturbances in the flow could round the ridge and at
least bring a few showers to portions of the area. As mentioned in
the short term section, the associated precipitation amounts are
relatively light so while there is some mention of showers through
the weekend, it`s likely that there won`t be a significant round
of precipitation and only perhaps a few light showers at times
into the weekend. Meanwhile, with a shift to a cooler and somewhat
drier flow aloft, expect to see the air mass to cool a bit late
in the week and this weekend. This could bring overnight
temperatures down into the 30s (lower 30s in the coolest spots,
mid 30s for most of the Puget Sound Region) for a few mornings
during this time period. For the start of next week, still strong
agreement in the ensemble guidance suggesting a ridge remaining in
place, though increasing disagreement in just how strong it is
and where the ridge axis remains. 12<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light flow aloft becoming northerly later this morning.
Light flow in the lower levels through Tuesday afternoon.

Mixed ceilings across western Washington early this morning with
LIFR along the coast and near KOLM. Largely MVFR elsewhere. Lower
stratus will remain in the area through much of the morning with
winds light and variable to northerly. Conditions will gradually
improve later this afternoon.

KSEA...MVFR at the terminal presently with a northerly wind of 5 to
7 kts. Wind direction remaining northerly, speeds will come down to
between 4 to 6 kt after 15Z to 16Z. Additionally, there is around a
30 percent chance that visibilities could be 1 mile or less between
12Z and 14Z and a 10 percent chance of less than half mile
visibilities in the same time frame. Presently, fog or mist is not
being reported at nearby terminals, but the TAF will be updated to
reflect any intrusions of such or to note lower stratus.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure building over the waters today and will
remain in place into the weekend. Small craft advisory winds or seas
not expected through the period. Some long period swell is possible
over the weekend with the weather system well to the west. Seas will
stay between 4 and 7 feet through the period with light northerly to
northwesterly flow.
