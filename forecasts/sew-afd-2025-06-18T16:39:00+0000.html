Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
939 AM PDT Wed Jun 18 2025

.SYNOPSIS...A weak frontal system will move through the area
today, bringing increased cloudiness and chances of showers to
western Washington. More notable precipitation chances are
expected Friday into Saturday as an upper level low moves inland
over the region. Warmer and drier conditions will return by early
next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...An upper level low spinning
off the coast of SE Alaska and British Columbia will continue to
drive the weather across the Pacific Northwest over the second
half of the week.

A weak frontal system will move across western Washington today,
bringing increased shower activity to the region. Rainfall amounts
will be rather light with this system, with most lowland locations
expected to only receive a few hundredths to up to a tenth of an
inch of rain. Locally higher amounts of up to a quarter of an inch
will be possible in the mountains, where shower activity will
become more confined to by the afternoon and evening hours.
Afternoon high temperatures will cool a few degrees from Tuesday`s
highs and look to top out in the mid 60s to low 70s across the
interior and in the upper 50s to low 60s along the coast.

A few post-frontal showers look to linger across western Washington
into Thursday, but expect the day to be drier as a whole. Afternoon
highs will be in the upper 60s to low 70s across the interior and
in the 60s along the coast.

The most notable precipitation of the week will arrive on Friday
as the upper level low spinning off the coast of SE Alaska and
British Columbia sinks southward and moves inland across the
region. This cool system will bring more widespread rain to the
lowlands and even a few inches of snow to the higher mountain
peaks as snow levels fall between 5000-6000 feet. Those with
plans for outdoor recreation in the mountains Friday into the
weekend will want to make sure to monitor the forecast for the
latest updates. High temperatures will trend much cooler, with
highs for the majority of the area only climbing into the upper
50s to low 60s.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Cool and showery conditions
will continue into the weekend, with Saturday still on track to
be the wettest day of the week. Showers will gradually become
more confined to the Cascades by the evening hours as the upper
level low starts to move off to the east. Temperatures will remain
cool, with highs expected to be in the low 60s.

Conditions then start to warm up and dry out Sunday into early
next week as the low exits the region and upper level ridging
starts to nudge its way back into the area from the west. High
temperatures look to climb a couple degrees each day, topping out
in the mid 70s to low 80s again by Tuesday. A few passing shortwaves
in the northwesterly flow aloft may bring some showers to the
higher terrain at times over the first half of the week.
