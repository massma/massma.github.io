Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
301 AM PDT Tue Oct 8 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cooler weather pattern settles into the Pacific
Northwest this week. A cold front will bring in cooler
temperatures, light precipitation, and brief breezy winds
today with associated showers continuing through Wednesday.
High pressure will allow conditions to dry out on Thursday ahead
of another incoming system towards the end of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Current IR satellite imagery
not doing the greatest job of displaying the weak front as it passes
through the area this morning. Turning attention to latest radar and
the leading edge of the rather splotchy echo pattern running from
Bellingham to Hoquiam /as of 230 AM PDT/ is likely the best
indicator. Temperatures still pretty mild over the area with many
obs along the coast and down the Sound in the mid to upper 50s with
60s still lingering over Seattle and Everett. Interior and island
locations have done a better job of cooling off, currently reporting
temps in the lower 50s.

The passing front will be the main weather feature for the day today
with showers present off and on throughout much of the day today as
it pushes eastward. QPF amounts from both deterministic models and
ensemble members look pretty meager, favoring amounts of a tenth of
an inch or less for lowland locations and ranging around a tenth to
a quarter of an inch possible in higher elevations. The upper level
trough associated with this front will sink southward
Wednesday...but neither of the deterministic models have it dipping
too far down into the CWA. While it should still sink south enough
to allow for Chance PoPs for much of the area...the SW interior and
southern Cascades may end up drying out before other locations. QPF
amounts Wednesday are on the caliber of today...again, not terribly
impressive. Upper level ridging builds in afterward, bringing dry
conditions to W WA as early as Wednesday evening and continuing into
Thursday.

High temperatures in the near term will cool some when compared to
yesterday, yet still remain a few degrees above climo. Highs in the
lower to mid 60s expected today before cooling into the upper 50s to
mid 60s both Wednesday and Thursday. Overnight lows will show a more
significant cooling trend: upper 40s to lower 50s tonight, then
falling into lower to mid 40s Wednesday and Thursday nights.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Upper level ridging remains a
factor into Friday although moisture preceding a pair of troughs,
one in the Gulf of Alaska and one just off the CA coast, may sneak
into W WA. Neither ensembles nor deterministic models favor this,
leaning toward dry conditions  persisting into Saturday...so not
entirely certain where NBM is getting Slight Chance to Chance PoPs
here. This does not exactly start the long term forecast off on the
best of footing, introducing some confidence issues. Not helping is
that again, both ensembles members and deterministic models are also
leaning toward keeping Saturday dry as well. NBM appears to be at
least catching on to some of this...with teen PoPs for the eastern
half of the CWA and 20-40 pct PoPs for points west...but these two
days continue to look to be a little overdone as per current model
data. Things start to sync up a little bit better for the start of
next week, when the aforementioned upper low over the Gulf of Alaska
starts an eastward push. PoPs for this period look a little more
realistic, generally in the high-end Chance to Likely categories,
but difficult to put any stock in this at the time being when
preceding days are still very much in a wait-and-see state.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Rain spreading inland this morning with possible MVFR
conditions. Cigs improving after 18-21z. Post-frontal onshore flow
this afternoon and evening with showers mainly coast and mountains.
Low clouds and MVFR to IFR conditions overnight and into Wednesday
morning. 33

KSEA...Rain and possible MVFR ceilings this morning, then VFR by
21z. Winds remaining S/SW to 10 kt. Low clouds and MVFR conditions
returning overnight. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak front will cross western WA today with southerly
winds switching to westerly (or onshore) tonight. Another frontal
system will cross the waters around mid-week. Low pressure (1000 mb)
remains over the offshore waters moving toward the weekend. Seas
around 5-8 feet through mid-week. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
