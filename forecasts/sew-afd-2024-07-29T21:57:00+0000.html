.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Unusually cooler and wetter weather today will linger
into Tuesday, then begin to trend drier and warmer by midweek.
The cooler early week temperatures will return to near normal
Wednesday, rise back above normal Thursday, Friday and through
the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The more widespread rain
light rain this morning has become more scattered this afternoon
with higher terrain the best bet for more persistent showers
overnight into Tuesday morning. This will get a bit of support as
the upper level trough passes overhead tonight into Tuesday
morning, as well as some chance for weak convergence developing
near the east entrance of the Strait of Juan de Fuca through
Whidbey Island that may result in some persistent light rain
there. The overall trend will be towards drier conditions
Tuesday. The larger lingering impact with the exiting system
Tuesday will likely be lingering widespread cloud cover supported
by low level onshore flow and plenty of low level moisture.
Building upper level ridging through the day will likely eat into
the cloud cover by afternoon, but the cooler start to the day will
keep highs below normal, in the mid 60s to mid 70s.

Ridging will continue to build into Wednesday with light onshore
flow and some morning cloud cover, ultimately resulting in near
normal temperatures and afternoon sunshine. Thursday will see a
solid return of above normal temperatures with what amounts to a
90% chance of temperatures above 80 degrees through much of the
interior from the Metro Puget Sound southward.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Ensembles highlighting a
return to a dry and warm patter Friday onward with warm air aloft
helping many locations through the interior reach into the upper
80s and lower 90s Friday.

Conditions look dry and warm through the weekend, with high
temperatures into the mid 80s and even low 90s for some areas.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front continues to push west across the
area this afternoon, maintaining widespread lower clouds and
residual rain showers. Ceilings are highly variable ranging from
LIFR to pockets of higher MVFR this afternoon. While the steadier
rain has shifted eastward, additional showers continue into tonight
with brief lower conditions possible as these pass. Expect some
local wind gusts to around 20 kt through the afternoon and evening.
With the moist air mass in place, expect widespread low ceilings to
persist overnight and through much of Tuesday for most.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings through the afternoon and evening with breezy
south/southwest surface winds around 10 kt with gusts to 20 kt
possible through evening. Winds ease overnight but expect low
ceilings to persist overnight and into much of Tuesday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front continues to move east this afternoon
and tonight. Winds remain generally 10-15 kt most waters, but could
see a few isolated gusts around 20 kt in portions of the interior
waters through evening. Meanwhile, seas generally holding around 3
to 5 ft. Stronger high pressure builds around Wednesday through the
end of the week, which will bring a return of diurnally breezy
northerly winds to the waters. This will lead to seas over the
coastal waters building to 6 to 7 ft and relatively short period
into the weekend. The largest and steepest seas will likely be
further offshore, beyond 30 nm, where the winds will be strongest.

.CLIMATE...The normal rainfall in Seattle for the entire month of
July is 0.60 inches. If Seattle gets 0.20 inches today that would
be a third of the monthly normal rainfall. A day with a third of
the monthly rainfall in November, December and January would be
around 1.75 to a little more than 2 inches.

The last time Seattle got more than a quarter of an inch of rain
in the last week of July was nearly 30 years ago ( 0.41 inches in
1995 ). There have only been 12 days in the last week of July
with 0.20 inches of more since records started at Seattle-Tacoma
airport in 1945. Last time it occurred, July 26, 1995 with 0.39
inches.

Seattle has not seen measurable rain between July 27th and August
1st in the last 15 years. Last time it rained during this time of
the year was 2008 with 0.11 inches on the 29th and 0.12 inches on
the 31st. Felton
