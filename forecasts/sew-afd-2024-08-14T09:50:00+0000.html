Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
250 AM PDT Wed Aug 14 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mostly cloudy skies will persist through the morning,
with afternoon sunshine and near normal temperatures this
afternoon. The pattern looks to trend wetter into the weekend
with what amounts to a good chance of widespread precipitation for
much of the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak high pressure replaces
the trough that was over western WA over the past few days. This,
along with lighter onshore flow, will result in slightly warmer
weather and less clouds (more sunbreaks) this afternoon. Highs in
the interior will reach the mid to upper 70s with cooler 60s along
the coast.

On Thursday, weak troughing sets up over the Pac NW once again.
This brings more clouds, mountain showers and cooler temps. There
is a slight chance of thunderstorms in the north Cascades near the
crest.

An upper level low drops down from Canada and spins offshore as we
move into Friday. This pattern places western WA under moist,
diffluent flow with additional showers and possible thunderstorms
in the Cascades. Onshore flow and lower heights keep temps across
the region cooler than average. 33

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The upper level low will
continue to spin offshore through the weekend and into early next
week. Western WA is under moist and unstable S/SW flow for a
chance of showers and thunderstorms Saturday and Sunday. Moving
forward, there`s a break in the precip (for the most part) Monday
and Tuesday as showers remain offshore. Ensemble members show more
rain possibilities by midweek as the low finally drifts inland.
Below average temperatures continue through the period. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mainly VFR with areas of MVFR to LIFR along the coast in
marine stratus. Mountain obscuration along the Cascades. MVFR
conditions in stratus will continue to spread inland early this
morning due to another marine push. Ceilings will scatter out by the
late morning followed by cloud bases lifting in the early afternoon
with another return to MVFR/IFR conditions in another marine push
early Thursday morning. Light winds this morning will generally
become northwesterly by the afternoon 5-10 kt.

KSEA...VFR cigs with mid-level clouds early this morning, expected
to lower towards MVFR, with the highest probabilities of MVFR
(around 30%) between 12-18z. Light winds will increase and become
westerly by late morning before turning more northwesterly in the
afternoon, generally 5-8 kts.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low visibilities through the morning along the
inner Coastal Waters and Strait of Juan de Fuca in fog. Onshore flow
will continue for the majority of this week across the area waters
with diurnally driven westerly pushes through the Strait of Juan de
Fuca each evening. Winds will near SCA criteria later this evening,
though confidence not high enough at this time to issue a Small
Craft. Confidence is higher for Thursday with a stronger push
through the Strait of Juan de Fuca expected.

Seas will remain 3 to 4 feet through Thursday and briefly build to 5
to 6 feet along the outer Coastal Waters on Friday.
