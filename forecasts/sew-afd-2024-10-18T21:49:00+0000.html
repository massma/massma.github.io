Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
249 PM PDT Fri Oct 18 2024

.SYNOPSIS...An atmospheric river will bring moderate to heavy
rainfall and gusty winds to western Washington throughout the
weekend. High pressure will then build into the region early next
week, providing relief from the wet conditions for a few days.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Wet and windy weekend ahead
with strong, moist W/SW flow over the region (AR or Atmospheric
River). This is the first AR event of the fall season and
certainly the wettest weather thus far.

The main impacts will be wind and periods of moderate to heavy
rain. The windiest spots will be the North Coast and North
Interior (Everett northward) with south gusty winds to 40-50 MPH
tonight through Saturday morning - a Wind Advisory remains in
effect. Rainfall totals through Sunday range from 4-6" over the
Olympic peninsula (with higher amounts possible), 3-4" over the
North Cascades, 1-4" over the North Interior and generally 0.50-1"
from Seattle south. Although flooding on the main stem rivers
remains low, we could still see an elevated threat of urban and
small stream flooding (water ponding over roadways, minor flooding
due to poor drainage, ect).

Steady rainfall comes to an end Sunday night as this band of
moisture shifts to our south. The air mass will be cool and
showery on Monday with a trough. Expect lows in the 40s and highs
in the 50s. Snow levels will drop to around 4,000 ft with light
snow over the higher mountain peaks and passes. 33

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Broad high pressure brings a
period of drier weather as we move through next week. Temperatures
remain on the cool-side with highs in the 50s and lows in the 30s
and 40s. South sound areas may see frost Wednesday and Thursday
mornings with lows in the lower 30s. The next shot of rain comes
on Friday as another trough moves in. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The first atmospheric river of the fall season is on
track to bring periods of moderate to heavy rainfall to western
Washington through the weekend, which will cause sharp rises to
area rivers. Forecast models focus the heaviest rainfall over the
northern coast, Olympic Peninsula, and North Cascades, where
rainfall amounts could locally reach 4 to 8 inches. The remainder
of the Cascades will see up to 2 to 4 inches of rain. Despite the
significant incoming rainfall, forecast models continue to keep
river flows below action stage and below minor flood thresholds
throughout the weekend. However, river forecast models often
struggle with the first event of the wet season in terms of
balancing runoff and river flow losses going overbank, so
conditions will continue to be closely monitored.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow aloft becoming westerly this
afternoon as warm front moves into southern British Columbia. The
front will stall tonight into Saturday. VFR to MVFR conditions
across the area with scattered rain showers. Ceilings should lower
area-wide to MVFR later this evening with locally IFR conditions
possible in heavier rain. Visibility may also be reduced at times to
3-5 SM. Conditions look to remain MVFR through most of the TAF
period, conditions may return to low-end VFR over Seattle and to the
southeast as early as around 21Z Saturday. Winds remain breezy out
of the south, with gusts up to 20-25 kt for most, up to 40-45 kt
through portions of the North Interior (including BLI).

KSEA...VFR conditions with rain in the area. Ceilings should sink
down to MVFR between 03-06Z Saturday and remain so through most of
the TAF period. Ceilings may rise back up to low-end VFR Saturday
afternoon. Southerly winds remain breezy, 8 to 15 kt with gusts up
to 20 kt possible at times.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A warm front will continue to slowly move across the area
today into tomorrow, with the trailing cold front not moving through
until Sunday. Rain, heavy at times, will persist through the weekend.

Winds up to gale force will begin to diminish through the coastal
waters tonight, though gusts up to gale force will continue into
tonight. Gale force winds are also expected through the East
Entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the Northern Inland Waters,
and Admiralty Inlet tonight. Small Craft Advisory winds are expected
tonight through Puget Sound. Breezy conditions continue into
tomorrow with Small Craft Advisory winds remaining across the area
until the warm front moves through Saturday afternoon. A brief push
of gusty winds are possible as the cold front moves through on
Sunday, followed by a push of westerlies down the Strait of Juan de
Fuca Sunday evening. Winds will ease across the area next week as
high pressure rebuilds across the area waters.

Seas 10 to 13 ft across the coastal waters remain through Saturday
before subsiding to 6 to 8 ft on Sunday, then to 3 to 5 ft next week.
