Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
121 AM EDT Sun Aug 11 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
A frontal boundary will continue to push slowly east offshore
as high pressure noses in from the southwest tonight through
Sunday night. A trough of low pressure passes through on
Monday, otherwise weak high pressure will be in control for much
of the week. A series of surface troughs may pivot through
towards the end of the week.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM THIS MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The forecast remains mainly on track.

The only potential problem to the forecast is some of the CAMs
bring some isolated showers across eastern portions of Long
Island and SE CT late tonight into Sunday morning as a weak wave
tries to develop along the old frontal boundary to the south.
However, with only weak lift associated with the wave and
subsidence from incoming high pressure, went with a dry
forecast. However a stray shower or two cannot be ruled out for
these areas and an increase in clouds can be expected. Would not
be surprised if skies become mostly cloudy into the morning
with this feature.

Expect a wide range of low temps for tonight, from near 70 in
NYC, to the 60s most elsewhere, to the mid/upper 50s in the
interior valleys where conditions should be good for radiational
cooling. Eastern Long Island may not radiate as well due to
potential cloud cover.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM THIS MORNING THROUGH 6 PM MONDAY/...
High pressure continues to build into the area resulting in
fair weather on Sunday. The upper level low and trough over the
central Great Lakes region will head into southern New England.
However, any precipitation with this system should remain north
and west of the forecast area during the day.

High temperatures should top out in the upper 70s to middle
80s, with afternoon dewpoints falling into the 50s for the
entire area. Low temps Sunday night should be a little cooler
than those forecast for tonight, generally from the mid 50s to
mid 60s, with NYC and coastal areas seeing upper 60s for lows.
Sunday night will likely be a better night for radiational
cooling across eastern Long Island and parts of SE CT away from
the coast.

&&

.LONG TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...
An upper level trough pivots through on Monday and exits Monday
night. A broad and less amplified trough attempts to get established
towards the middle of the week. The trough may amplify some towards
next weekend.

Most of the time expect dry conditions through the period. Have
chosen to go above guidance with respect to PoPs on Monday with mid
and upper level energy pivoting through. Otherwise it should be
completely dry Tuesday through Thursday with weak and broad high
pressure established in the lower levels. The global guidance
appears to be favoring a re-introduction to PoPs towards late Friday
and into the start of next weekend with weak convergence lines
attempting to form near the surface. This could trigger some
diurnally driven convection, but coverage this far out remains in
doubt.

Temperatures through much of the period will be slightly below
normal for mid August. Also, dew points will be running lower than
they have been for much of the summer thus far. Towards Friday into
Saturday temperatures may warm by a few degrees with a gradual
uptick in the humidity.

&&

.AVIATION /06Z SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>VFR with high pressure in control.

Winds will continue veering to the NW to N early this morning at
NYC terminals with light and variable elsewhere. Light and
variable flow likely continues 12-15z before gradually become
W-WSW at most terminals except along the coast where winds
should become SW-S. Wind speeds increase to near 10 kt this
afternoon. Winds diminish this evening.

     NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Wind direction uncertain 12-15z, but speeds should remain 5 kt
or less.

Winds at KLGA could remain WNW-NW until around 20-22z before
shifting to the SW.

OUTLOOK FOR 06Z MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...

Sunday night: VFR.

Monday: VFR. Slight chance of an afternoon/early evening shower.

Tuesday-Thursday: VFR.

.MARINE...
Winds and waves are expected to remain below advisory levels
through Sunday night with a weak pressure gradient in place.

Weak high pressure will be in control across the waters Monday
through Wednesday. Ocean seas will be up to 3 ft Monday, and
generally closer to 2 ft late Tuesday and Wednesday.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
There are no hydrologic concerns through next week.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
A 7 second period lingers into Sunday with a moderate risk of rip
currents. The rip current risk drops to low for the more western
ocean beach on Monday, with a moderate risk continuing for the
Suffolk ocean beaches with a 3 to 4 ft component further east.

&&
