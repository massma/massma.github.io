Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
930 AM PDT Mon Aug 5 2024

.SYNOPSIS...High pressure aloft to start the week with continued
above normal temperatures and dry weather. However, increased
onshore flow will bring near-normal conditions on Tuesday before
warming up shortly afterwards. Subtle disturbances may usher
marginal thunderstorm potential over the Cascades mainly during
the second half of the week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Four Corners ridge remains
in place as its axis is directly over the PNW. Upstream, a baggy
500 mb trough is positioned offshore as its center is just off
the WA/OR coast. Here locally, we`ve been under persistent
southwest flow aloft as the pattern has been rather stagnant so
of course, dry weather and slightly above-normal temperatures for
the interior is expected today. Thunderstorm activity has been
observed so far morning in N OR but SW flow aloft should steer it
clear of our area. Can`t rule out the Lewis County Cascades
getting clipped but confidence is leaning mostly dry. Marine
stratus is making a run inland as morning clouds start things off
but diurnal mixing will give way to mostly clear skies for most
during the afternoon. Highs today are to top into the low to mid
80s across the lowlands with Cascade valleys getting near 90 F.
Coastal areas will maintain in the 60s and 70s.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Deterministic guidance has
quasi-zonal flow of the area on Thursday. Will have to monitor
the continued threat for elevation convection during the second
half of the week. Around Friday, models are hinting at a shortwave
trough over the PNW and upper-ridging upstream over the NE Pac.
Ensemble guidance continues to favor above normal temperatures
through the rest of the forecast period.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Areas of IFR/LIFR in widespread marine stratus.
Conditions inland will continue to improve throughout the morning
and early afternoon as the stratus burns off, with MVFR expected to
persist along the coast. Generally light W/SW winds through the TAF
period.

KSEA...Stratus scattering out from KSEA by 18z with VFR conditions
through the rest of the day. A stronger marine push early Tuesday
will bring in another round of IFR ceilings. Winds generally W to SW
8 to 12 kt.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A persistent pattern will continue across the region
through early next week with broad high pressure offshore and lower
pressure inland. Diurnally driven westerly winds are expected
through the Strait of Juan de Fuca will continue, with Small Craft
Advisory winds expected this evening, and perhaps again Tuesday
evening as well. Onshore flow will weaken later Wednesday into late
week. Persistent northwest winds will continue over the outer
coastal waters. Steep conditions over the next few days for the
outer coastal waters with seas generally 5 to 6 feet. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
