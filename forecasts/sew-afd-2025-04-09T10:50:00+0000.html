south today with showers ending in the morning. Ridge shifting
east tonight. Next front arriving Thursday evening. Upper level
trough over Western Washington Friday will move east Saturday.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
mostly cloudy skies over most of Western Washington early this
morning with some clearing in the Central Puget Sound. Scattered
showers on the doppler radar west of Puget Sound and in a dying
convergence zone over Skagit county. Patchy fog has formed over
the Southwest Interior with Olympia reporting one quarter of a
mile visibility. Temperatures were in the upper 30s and 40s.

Upper level ridge building into the area from the south today will
bring about an end to the showers this morning. Fog in the
Southwest Interior is shallow and will dissipate by mid morning.
Decreasing clouds initially as the ridge builds in but by late
afternoon some high clouds will arrive with the southwesterly flow
aloft. High temperatures a little warmer, in the mid 50s to lower
60s.

Upper level ridge shifting east tonight with increasing high
clouds. This will keep low temperatures mostly in the 40s.

Next system approaching the area Thursday with rain out ahead of
the front reaching the coast in the morning. Rain spreading inland
in the afternoon. With Western Washington in the warm sector and a
little offshore flow ahead of the front, highs in the Cascade
foothills could get as warm as the upper 60s. For the remainder of
the area mid 50s to lower 60s.

Front moving inland Thursday night with the front moving through
the Puget Sound area before midnight. Rain changing to showers
behind the front. Good increase in onshore flow with and behind
the front for another round of breezy conditions. Lows in the mid
30s to lower 40s.

Post frontal upper level trough over the area Friday keeping
showers in the forecast. Friday looks to be a pretty similar day
to yesterday, cool and breezy with highs in the lower to mid 50s.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement again with the upper level trough moving east Saturday
but not fast enough to keep showers out of the forecast.

Upper level ridge building into the area Sunday. The GFS weakens
the ridge quickly with zonal flow aloft for Monday and Tuesday.
The ECMWF is stronger with the ridge but also shifts the ridge
east by Tuesday. Operational runs not indicating any precipitation
Tuesday but the there are enough wet solutions in the ensembles
to put a slight chance of showers in the forecast.

Highs in the lower to mid 50s Saturday. Warming trend Sunday and
Monday with highs peaking in the upper 50s to mid 60s Monday.
Temperatures cool a couple of degrees for Tuesday. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft shifting southwesterly overnight into
early Thursday. A ridge building in will allow for more VFR to be
observed. Low-level moisture remains however, so areas of MVFR cigs
and very isolated fog (KOLM) can`t be ruled out this morning. For
today, VFR area-wide after 18z as an upper-ridge settles overhead.
Breezy S-SW surface winds 5-10 kt will decrease today and trend more
northerly into the afternoon-evening. VFR again Wednesday night into
Thursday as mid-high level clouds prevent low clouds and fog
development.

KSEA...VFR in place and will persist through the TAF period. SW
winds 5-10 kt will decrease to 5 kt as the day progress. Surface
winds will see a northerly switch around 23-01z then out of the SE
overnight into early Thursday ahead of the next front.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>All SCAs have been allowed to expire as surface high
pressure builds. Winds/seas will relax today as a result. However,
the next threat for headlines looms on Thursday. A front is favored
to bring a push of southerlies across area waters. A gale watch has
been issued for the coastal waters as the potential for frequent
gale gusts exists. Southerlies and a push of westerlies down the
strait may also promote SCAs for inland waters such as central/east
strait and Admiralty Inlet. High pressure looks to build over the
weekend and into the beginning of next week.

Combined seas 5 to 7 feet today, before gradually building back up
to around 8 to 10 feet Thursday and Friday. Seas lessen to 4 to 6 ft
Saturday night-Sunday.

After this morning, no river flooding for the next 7 days
including the Skokomish. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
