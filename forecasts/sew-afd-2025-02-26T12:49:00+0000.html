Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
449 AM PST Wed Feb 26 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Drier and warmer conditions are expected today with
upper level ridging over the region. A weak front will approach
the region on Thursday and weaken over the area, bringing some
light showers to western Washington. Conditions then look to dry
out again on Friday before chances of precipitation return for the
weekend and persist into early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows some
mid to high cloud cover streaming in across western Washington
early this morning. Meanwhile, fog has already developed for
areas across the south Sound and Southwest Interior that have
cleared out. Overall, expect drier and warmer conditions for
western Washington today with upper level ridging over the region.
Areas of fog will lift and scatter by the mid to late morning
hours. Afternoon high temperatures will warm into the mid to upper
50s across the area- with some spots even having the potential to
hit 60 today.

A splitting frontal system approaching the region late tonight
into Thursday will bring the return of rain chances mainly for
areas along the Olympic Peninsula, the San Juans, and the Northern
Interior. With the front breaking up over the area, expect any
precipitation to remain rather light - and for totals to only be
a few hundredths of an inch. Afternoon high temperatures on
Thursday may increase a degree or two for most spots to top out
in the mid 50s to low 60s. Meanwhile, overnight lows will be in
the mid 30s to low 40s.

Upper level ridging will then return on Friday for another dry
and warm day across western Washington. Temperatures will be
similar to Thursday`s, with highs looking to top out in the upper
50s to low 60s and with lows generally expected to be in the mid
30s to low 40s.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...There remains some
uncertainty in just how the pattern shapes up over the weekend,
however the upper level ridge situated over the region does look
to push inland somewhat on Saturday. Latest guidance hints at an
incoming upper level trough over the Pacific splitting off from
the main flow and pushing into California Sunday into Monday.
Should this be the case, some wrap around moisture from the low
may push back up into western Washington over the weekend and into
early next week and bring the return of precipitation to the
area. At this time, overall precipitation amounts look to remain
rather light, with no significant weather impacts expected through
the long term. Temperatures generally look to cool a couple
degrees, with highs expected to be in the low to mid 50s and
overnight lows to be in the upper 30s to mid 40s. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Most terminals across Western Washington currently VFR
early this morning (with the exception of KCLM and KOLM). Little to
no sky cover early this morning may promote the development of
patchy fog along Kitsap Peninsula and southern interior, bringing
down ceilings/visibilities into IFR/LIFR. Conditions expected to
improve in the morning hours into VFR and persist through the
majority of the TAF period. Patchy fog is possible Wednesday night
into Thursday morning along the southern interior and Kitsap
Peninsula.

Winds will continue to shift northeasterly into the morning hours,
and remain light at 3-5 kt. Winds will shift southeasterly later
this afternoon. Breezy conditions expected along KHQM this morning,
with possible wind gusts of 20-25 kt.

KSEA...VFR conditions expected to persist through the majority of
the TAF period. Patchy fog is possible Wednesday night into Thursday
morning as guidance hints at IFR/LIFR conditions (20% chance)
developing toward the end of the TAF period.

Winds will continue to shift northeasterly throughout the morning
hours, with speeds of 4-6 kt. Winds will gradually shift
southeasterly by Wednesday evening, with speeds of 3-5 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the waters will weaken Wednesday
afternoon, as a weak frontal system moves across the offshore waters
late Wednesday night into Thursday morning. High pressure will
rebuild Thursday afternoon in the wake of the front`s passing, but
will weaken on Friday as another frontal system is expected to move
across the coastal waters into the weekend.

Combined seas will remain elevated at 10-13 ft as the frontal system
moves over the waters Wednesday night and Thursday morning. Seas
will gradually subside throughout Thursday afternoon/evening and by
Friday look to be below 10 ft. Waves will build above 10 ft into the
weekend.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A flood warning remains in effect for the Chehalis
River at Grand Mound in Thurston County as the precipitation from
earlier this week should be enough to push the river up to minor
flood stage later this morning through Thursday. A flood warning
also remains in effect for the Skokomish River near Potlatch in
Mason county. The river has crested in moderate flood stage and
will continue to recede over the next few days, likely falling
below flood stage over the weekend. A flood watch remains in
effect for Grays Harbor county as rises continue along additional
points of the Chehalis River. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
