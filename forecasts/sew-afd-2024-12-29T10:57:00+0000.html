.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The next frontal system will move into the region
from the south today, bringing lowland rain and mountain snow to
western Washington. Showers will linger into Monday, however
expect a gradual drying trend to commence and persist into Tuesday
for a brief break in the active weather pattern. The active
weather then returns mid to late week as additional systems move
into the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The next round of lowland
rain and mountain snow will move up into western Washington today
from the south, with radar this morning already showing some
light rain making its way northward into Lewis and Grays Harbor
counties. Expect this precipitation to continue to make its way
northward through the day as a weak low pressure system over the
coastal waters moves inland across the region. Overall, expect
rainfall accumulations of roughly a quarter of an inch to half an
inch for the majority of the lowlands, though areas along the
Pacific Coast could see locally higher rainfall amounts of up to
three quarters of an inch.

Additional rounds of snow are expected for the mountains, with
accumulations expected at the passes. Snow levels will fall
throughout the day and will generally hover between 2500-3000
feet tonight into Monday. The majority of the moisture with this
system remains focused on the south and central Cascades, with snow
accumulations of 8-12 inches expected for Snoqualmie and Stevens
passes. Though, locally higher amounts are possible further south
for White Pass. Hi-res guidance does continue to hint at some
convergence zone banding setting up across the central Cascades by
this evening, which could bring locally higher snow amounts and
rates of up to 1 inch per hour to areas that fall underneath this
banding. Lighter accumulations are expected for the Olympics and
North Cascades, though snow amounts across the North Cascades may
bear watching.

Showers will linger into Monday as an upper level trough swings
across the area, though expect a gradual drying trend to commence
with rain and mountain snow gradually tapering throughout the
day. A transient upper ridge will then move into the area on
Tuesday, which will provide western Washington with a brief break
in the active weather pattern. Brief is the key word here, however,
as the next system is slated to approach the region Tuesday night
into early Wednesday.

Lastly, the potential for minor coastal flooding will need to
continue to be monitored throughout the week as the next round of
perigean spring tides occur - especially for areas along the
Strait of Juan de Fuca and the northern interior waters. At this
time, weather does not look to exacerbate flooding concerns in the
the immediate near term, however will need to monitor this trend
heading into the second half of the week.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Active weather returns
mid to late week as additional systems move into the region. The
next system will move into the area on Wednesday, bringing the
next round of lowland rain and mountain snow to western Washington.
Warmer systems late in the week may allow for snow levels to rise
between 4000-6000 feet. At this time, expect unsettled conditions
to persist throughout the long term, with additional rounds of
lowland rain, mountain snow, and breezy conditions. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Rain showers are re-emerging along the coast and in
through the southwest interior early this morning, with rain
arriving throughout much of Puget Sound after 14Z. Before the rain
arrives, there will be a period of ENE winds generally between 12Z
and 18Z, with speeds peaking in the 8 to 11 kt range, before turning
back around to the SW as the front nears the coast. After that, SW
winds through the rest of the period, with some gusts in the
afternoon 20 kt, namely in the south Sound region. Expect
predominantly MVFR cigs for all terminals throughout the TAF period,
with isolated drops to IFR in bands of heavier showers in the
afternoon.

KSEA...VFR at the terminal early this morning, with winds
transitioning to the ENE between 5 to 7 kt. Expect ENE winds from
approximately 12Z to 18Z, with a peak in speeds of 8 to 11 kts
between 15Z and 18Z. Probabilistic guidance suggests that there is
roughly a one in ten chance of wind speeds staying above 10 kt from
the ENE for as long as 21Z, but the mean solution generally favors
the turnaround back to SSW winds after 18Z as the front approaches
the region. While the ENE winds are occuring, expect cigs to
generally be MVFR with OVC layers between 020 and 025 and
visibilities ranging from 5SM to 6SM in shower activity. Once the
SSW winds resume, they will likely range in speed from 7 to 9 kts.
Gusts of 20 to 23 kt are likely after 00Z as the front moves
through. Expect rain showers this morning, transitioning to -RA in
the afternoon. Gust activity will taper after 03Z, but with
southerly winds remaining between 10 and 12 kt thereafter.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The next front is arriving across southern coastal waters
early this morning, keeping seas around 10 feet with showers and
isolated gusty conditions. Current SCA headlines will remain over
the coast and west entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca until
late this morning, but will be focused on elevated seas rather
than wind speeds. Seas thereafter will ease below 10 feet whilst
between weather systems and the SCA will be allowed to expire.
After a bit of a lull early in the week, the next front will reach
the waters later Tuesday into Wednesday and bring a better chance
at more substantial advisory winds to the coastal waters and the
eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Additional precipitation is expected today into
Monday as another weather system moves into western Washington.
Currently, the Skokomish is the only river in flood and forecast
to remain in flood stage over the next few days. The Chehalis
River has crested downstream at Grand Mound, and the forecast
keeps the river at action stage at Porter. A break in the rain
will allow for rivers to recede later Monday into Tuesday before
an active, wetter period begins again mid to late week. Several
inches of rain will be possible over the Olympic Peninsula through
late next week, bringing the potential for additional rises on
Olympic area rivers.
