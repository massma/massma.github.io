Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
1016 AM PST Mon Dec 2 2024

.SYNOPSIS...High pressure will continue to amplify into western
Washington into early this week, allowing for dry conditions and
periods of morning fog and low stratus. The upper ridge will weaken
towards the middle of next week as the next storm system approaches,
bringing in the next chance for widespread precipitation across the
region.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Widespread low clouds and
fog across the interior. Also getting a few reports of freezing
fog this morning. With the fog ridge, we may not completely clear
out this afternoon, leading to cooler temps. Adjustments were
made based on the trends. 33

Previous discussion...As of 2 AM PST, satellite shows widespread
fog expanding this morning across the Puget Sound and surrounding
lowlands, Chehalis Valley towards Grays Harbor, and over the Hood
Canal and through the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Locally dense fog
has limited visibilities in some areas to a quarter mile or less,
and low temperatures near freezing has produced pockets of
freezing fog. A Dense Fog Advisory has been issued for much of the
lowlands for pockets of greatly reduced visibility through the
late morning. With high pressure firmly in place, expect a foggy
commute and for conditions to slowly improve into the late morning
and early afternoon.

High pressure will continue to build northward into western
Washington throughout the first half of this week, maintaining dry
conditions and mostly sunny skies with near- normal temperatures.
Fog and low stratus will continue to redevelop each morning and
linger into the early afternoon hours, with some areas seeing dense
or freezing fog. There will continue to be little change to the
overall weather pattern day- to-day through Wednesday, with highs in
the upper 40s to lower 50s and lows near freezing across the
lowlands.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...A pattern change is on
track for the second half of this week as the upper ridge weakens
and troughing develops over the region. A disturbance will override
the ridge on Thursday, set to bring a quick shot of rain to the
region with snow levels near 7000 ft. A warm front will lift across
western Washington on Friday, bringing in another round of
widespread rainfall and warmer air that will bring temperatures into
the 50s across much of the lowlands. A cold front will follow close
behind on Saturday, maintaining chances for precipitation and
bringing snow levels down to 3000-4000 ft.
Ensembles favor a slightly drier solution for Sunday with weak
ridging building into the region. Rivers will see rises over the
weekend with the incoming precipitation, but flooding is not
expected.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure aloft remains in place over the region
today with light west to southwest flow aloft. Currently widespread
LIFR conditions across the terminals due to fog. Conditions should
start to improve between 18Z-20Z, however the confidence is low on
when exactly the fog will dissipate. Temporary minor improvement to
VFR conditions is expected once the fog does burn out. However,
widespread LIFR conditions are expected once again tonight with
visibilities starting to decrease as early as 0Z.

KSEA...LIFR conditions currently at 1/4 SM at the terminal, but
conditions are expected to improve to VFR around 22Z. Conditions
will quickly deteriorate into the evening and into tonight with LIFR
conditions setting in as early as 3Z. As of now, currently expecting
LIFR conditions to improve to VFR around 19Z on Tuesday. However,
there is low confidence on the exact timing the fog will begin to
diminish.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure at the surface and aloft will remain in
control through midweek. This will lead to abundant night and
morning fog with visibilities below 1 mile at times...especially
across the inland waters. The ridge will break down late in the week
with the first of a series of frontal systems arriving on Thursday.
Stronger systems will follow Friday and again on Saturday with
headlines expected for much of the waters. Seas will climb back over
over 10 feet across portions of the coastal waters by the weekend. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

days.
