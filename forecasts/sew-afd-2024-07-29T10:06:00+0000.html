Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Front moving through Western Washington today.
Trailing upper level trough moving through tonight. Upper level
ridge beginning to build over the area Tuesday. The ridge will
strengthen in the middle of the week and remain over the area
through the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
cold front offshore near 127W. Doppler radar has the rain out
ahead of the front as far east as the Olympics at 3 am/10z. Cloudy
skies over the remainder of the area. Temperatures were in the mid
50s to lower 60s.

Front moving east today with the eastward motion slowly down a
little bit as the associated upper level trough digs south during
the day. Front reaching the coast this morning, moving through
the interior this afternoon. Rain out ahead of the front will
spread over the entire area by mid morning with the rain arriving
in the metro area just in time for the morning commute. Rain will
taper off in the lowlands in the afternoon but will continue in
the Cascades. Temperatures with the clouds and rain will not vary
much with highs in the lower to mid 60s.

Upper level trough moving through Western Washington tonight
keeping showers in the forecast. Convergence zone developing near
the east entrance of the Strait of Juan de Fuca will dissipate
after midnight. Not a much in the way of clearing behind the front
keeping low temperatures Tuesday morning in the mid 50s to lower
60s.

Tuesday a transition day with the trough off to the east and an
upper level ridge beginning to slowly build in from the southeast.
Low level onshore flow combined with plenty of low level moisture
left around from the rain today will keep skies cloudy Tuesday
morning. The subsidence from the ridge building will create some
breaks in the cloud cover in the afternoon. Highs will remain
below normal, in the mid 60s to mid 70s.

Upper level ridge continuing to build over the area Tuesday night
and Wednesday. By Wednesday afternoon 500 mb heights in the mid to
upper 580 dms. Light onshore gradients will keep some cloud cover
over the area through Wednesday morning with the ridge building
drying up the low level moisture by Wednesday afternoon.
Surface gradients go northwesterly Wednesday afternoon which will
keep temperatures near normal, near 70 on the coast and 70s and
lower 80s inland. Lows Wednesday morning in the mid 50s to lower
60s.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement Thursday and Friday with the upper level ridge
continuing to build over the area. 500 mb heights peaking in the
lower to mid 590 dms Friday afternoon. Surface gradients never
turn offshore but with such warm air aloft the warmer locations,
like the Southwest Interior, will get into the lower 90s Friday.
Highs Thursday 70s along the coast and mid 70s to mid 80s for the
interior. Highs a couple of degrees warmer all locations Friday.

Some differences in the models start to show up over the weekend.
Both operational runs have a shortwave Saturday or Saturday night
putting a dent in the ridge. The GFS solution turns the flow aloft
more southerly which brings up the potential for convection in the
Cascades. The shortwave on the ECMWF takes a more northerly track
with the flow aloft staying westerly. The ensembles off both runs
don`t really have this feature at all keeping temperatures
similar both days with just a little cooling Sunday as the ridge
weakens slightly and the low level onshore flow increases. Will
stay with the ensemble solutions for now but keep an eye out on
later runs to see if the 00z GFS solution stays in the operational
model. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly-northwesterly flow aloft as an upper level
trough swings through western Washington. MVFR stratus and rain
has arrived early this morning along the coast. Stratus and rain
will continue to spread inland this morning, with ceilings
lowering to MVFR/IFR through majority of interior terminals.
Showers expected to move over the interior 12z-14z, and will
continue to linger throughout the afternoon. Little to no
improvement is expected in ceilings as a general blanket of
MVFR/IFR conditions will persist through the remainder of the
day.

KSEA...VFR conditions briefly this morning before the arrival of
low clouds and rain. MVFR ceilings will return to the terminal
around 10-12z and will generally remain that way through the rest
of the TAF period. Southwesterly winds 5 to 10 knots this
morning, and will likely increase to 8 to 12 knots this afternoon
with a few gusts up to 15 to 20 kts possible.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure continues to remain offshore with
lower pressure inland. A frontal system will cross over the area
waters this morning with winds remaining under criteria. High
pressure will build over the coastal waters through the rest of
the week for benign marine conditions.

Coastal seas 3 to 5 feet will persist through the next several
days.

.CLIMATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The normal rainfall in Seattle for the entire month of
July is 0.60 inches. If Seattle gets 0.20 inches today that would
be a third of the monthly normal rainfall. A day with a third of
the monthly rainfall in November, December and January would be
around 1.75 to a little more than 2 inches.

The last time Seattle got more than a quarter of an inch of rain
in the last week of July was nearly 30 years ago ( 0.41 inches in
1995 ). There have only been 12 days in the last week of July
with 0.20 inches of more since records started at Seattle-Tacoma
airport in 1945. Last time it occurred, July 26, 1995 with 0.39
inches.

Seattle has not seen measurable rain between July 27th and August
1st in the last 15 years. Last time it rained during this time of
the year was 2008 with 0.11 inches on the 29th and 0.12 inches on
the 31st. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
