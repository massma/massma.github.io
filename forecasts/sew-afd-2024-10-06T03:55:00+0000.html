.PREV DISCUSSION... <span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>/issued 332 PM PDT Sat Oct 5 2024/

.SYNOPSIS...A warming trend will continue through Monday as a
weak upper level ridge moves through the area. Patchy fog will be
possible in the morning. An upper level trough and associated
surface cold front will drift southward from British Columbia
through the beginning of the week and weaken, bringing light rain
chances through most of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...A thin blanket of
altostratus covers the northern half of the region as a warm front
moves onshore onto British Columbia. This system will remain up
to the north, keeping at least the southern half of the region
mostly clear, with mostly high clouds to the north. Light offshore
flow and a weak upper level ridge moving through this weekend
will allow temperatures to warm each day, with highs in the mid
60s to near 70 on Sunday, up to the low to mid 70s on Monday,
mainly for the interior and away from the water. Areas of fog will
be possible in the morning, especially Sunday morning, with lows
dropping into the low 40s. Fog will be most likely over the
Southwest Interior, and the Kitsap Peninsula, as well as in the
river valleys--in a similar manner to what occurred this morning.

As the ridge slowly shifts eastward through the beginning of the
week, that will allow the system presently over British Columbia
to shift southeastward towards our area, allowing for chances of
rain to begin as early as Monday afternoon over northwestern
Washington. This system will continue to slowly shift southward
early on Tuesday but weaken as it does so. Rainfall amounts will
be light, with most of the area seeing a few hundredths to a few
tenths of an inch possible. The best chance for more substantial
rainfall will be in the northwest Olympic Peninsula near Neah Bay,
where up to a half an inch is expected with locally higher amounts
up to an inch are possible around Cape Flattery. All in all, and
over the span of two days, this system currently does not look to
be hydrologically impactful.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Chances for light rain
look to continue into the end of the week as the trough continues
to dig southward and with a very slow westward progression with a
large ridge building over the central U.S. If the ridge builds
farther westward, that could keep the trough farther west and
bring a break to precipitation chances late week. Ensembles
finally kick the trough eastward on Friday with a fairly sharp
ridge quickly building in behind that for next weekend. If that
evolution occurs, that will allow for a warming trend and drier
weather, which concurs well with the Climate Prediction Center`s 6
to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Western Washington remains on the periphery of an upper
level ridge with west to southwest flow aloft. With surface
gradients turning light and limited high cloud coverage overnight,
conditions remain favorable for the formation of LIFR in fog and/or
very low stratus with surface visibilities below 3 miles at times
especially across the Southwest Interior, south Puget Sound, and
outlying river valleys. Low clouds should dissipate by 18Z Sunday
with VFR under varying amounts of high clouds for the afternoon
hours.

KSEA...Model guidance supports some shallow LIFR fog formation in
the vicinity of the terminal on Sunday morning. Some of this may
form in valleys north/east of the airport and migrate westward in
light low level easterly flow around daybreak. For now, current
forecasts of vicinity fog from 13Z to around 16Z look good. VFR
expected once again Sunday afternoon with just high level clouds.
Surface winds northerly becoming light/variable overnight then light
W/SW on Sunday afternoon.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...A surface ridge will continue to build into the
region into Sunday, with northerly winds today shifting to southerly
later on Sunday as a dissipating cold front approaches. The front
will cross area waters on Monday, bringing in a surge of winds and
higher seas. While criteria is borderline for a SCA, conditions will
continue to be monitored as the system gets closer. Another weak
system is on track to follow mid-week.

Seas at 4 to 5 ft will rise to 7 to 9 ft as a cold front crosses the
region late Sunday into Monday. Seas will stay between 6 and 8 ft
with a slightly stronger swell briefly bringing in seas up to 10 ft
later next week. Seas are on track to weaken to 5 to 6 ft by the end
of next week.
