Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
823 AM PST Thu Feb 6 2025

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A band of snow showers stemming from Aberdeen towards
the North Cascades persists this morning, but will taper off as
split flow develops aloft and conditions dry out. A Winter
Weather Advisory remains in effect through 10 AM for much of the
lowlands, while areas including the north coast, San Juan Islands
and western Whatcom County, and the Olympia and Tacoma metro areas
have been allowed to expire from the Advisory. The region will
see some relief from persistent snow showers by the afternoon,
with skies on track to become mostly clear later in the day.
However, this will allow temperatures to plummet overnight, with
any melting re-freezing early Friday morning causing slippery and
slick conditions once again. A Cold Weather Advisory remains in
effect Friday morning between western Whatcom County through the
Seattle metro area and Cascade Foothills for very cold morning
temperatures. No updates to the forecast but conditions will
continue to be closely monitored.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...An upper level low spinning offshore will continue to
bring rain and snow showers to western Washington through the
morning hours. Shower activity will taper this afternoon for
clearing conditions this evening. Cold temperatures will settle
into the region by Friday morning as the upper trough pushes
inland over the Pacific Northwest. A weak system will bring
additional chances of snow showers to the area over the weekend.
Cool temperatures and periodic chances of snow showers will
persist into next week.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Overall, the main
determination for precipitation type through early this morning
will continue to be the temperature profile, so will be monitoring
this closely over the next few hours. Winter weather advisories
remain in effect through late this morning for much of the
interior lowlands as an additional inch of snow will still be
possible in any heavier precipitation bands that do develop.

Hi-res guidance indicates shower activity tapering by the
afternoon hours as the low offshore sinks southward. Clearing
skies this afternoon and evening will bring significant cooling to
the region by Friday morning, with many lowland locations
expecting to see overnight lows dip into the teens and 20s. Cold
Weather Advisories remain in effect for the Cascade foothills and
the Puget Sound lowlands extending from King County up through
Whatcom county through Friday morning.

Chances for snow showers will increase again late Friday into
Saturday morning as the upper low moves inland to the south and
pushes some wrap around moisture back up into the region. A weak
shortwave will follow close behind, dropping into the region from
the north and will likely keep shower activity going across
western Washington through Saturday. While confidence in regards
to exact snow amounts and intensity of showers remains low at this
time, amounts at this time generally look to be lighter. Temperatures
into the weekend will continue to trend below average, with highs
on Saturday in the upper 30s to low 40s and overnight lows
expected to be in the mid 20s to near freezing.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Western Washington will
remain under northerly flow aloft as upper troughing looks to
persist over the Pacific Northwest and upper level ridging builds
over the northeastern Pacific and Gulf of Alaska in the long term.
Temperatures will remain below normal and look to cool heading
into midweek, with highs expected to be in the 30s and overnight
lows consistently dipping down into the 20s and teens. Weak systems
embedded in the northerly flow aloft may bring additional chances
for snow showers at times through early next week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow turning more westerly aloft as a
shortwave continues to bring precipitation across W WA. Mixed
conditions out there this morning with scattered snow showers.
Already seeing some slight improvement into MVFR for most terminals,
with snow showers slowly dissipating this morning. Conditions will
recover to VFR by the afternoon (20z-23z) as the lower levels dry
out with offshore flow.

KSEA...LIFR conditions at the terminal associated with some fog that
has developed at the terminal. Conditions will slowly improve
throughout the morning and be VFR by the afternoon and remain that
way throughout the TAF period. Snow showers should be coming to an
end this morning between 16Z-19Z. Southerly winds this morning winds
8 to 12 knots will shift more northerly after 18z, with speeds
generally remaining elevated around 10 to 12 knots through the
evening.
