Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
318 AM PDT Fri Oct 4 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Front moving through Western Washington later this
morning into the early afternoon hours. Convergence zone forming
behind the front over Snohomish County will dissipate this
evening. Upper level ridge building tonight will remain over the
area through the weekend. Ridge shifting east Monday opening the
door for the possibility of systems reaching the area Tuesday
through Thursday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
clouds increasing over the area early this morning. Rain out ahead
of the approaching front has already arrived along the north
coast. Clear skies earlier allowed temperatures to drop into the
lower 40s over the Southwest Interior. Temperatures over the
remainder of the area at 3 am/10z were in the mid 40s to lower
50s.

Front picking up a little speed this morning. Frontal passage
expected along the coast later this morning, in the Puget Sound
area late morning with the front moving into the Cascades early
this afternoon. Post frontal showers beginning to diminish later
this afternoon except in the convergence zone that develops over
Snohomish County. Chance of thunderstorms in the convergence zone.
Highs near 60.

Post frontal shower activity drying up overnight as upper level
ridge begins to build into Western Washington. Convergence zone
dissipating in the evening. Low level flow becoming light early
Saturday morning. With the low level moisture from Friday`s rain
patchy fog developing in the fog prone areas like the Southwest
Interior. Lows in the 40s.

Upper level ridge continuing to build Saturday with the ridge
remaining over the area through the weekend. Ridge axis bouncing
back and forth between Western and Eastern Washington but the
ridge will keep storms out of the region. Patchy fog dissipating
Saturday morning with plenty of afternoon sunshine warming highs
in the lower to mid 60s. A little warmer Sunday with highs in the
60s.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement Monday with the upper level ridge shifting east. Some
differences in the models on just how intact and when the next
front arrives into the area. The ECMWF has a weak front moving
through Tuesday while the GFS solution keeps the front more intact
and delays the front into Wednesday. Ensemble solutions generally
agree with the operational runs making for a broad brush mostly
cloudy chance of rain forecast Tuesday and Wednesday. Model
solutions continue to diverge Thursday with the ECMWF building a
ridge over the area ahead of a digging upper level back near
40N/140W. The GFS has the trough a little closer to the coast and
keeps Western Washington in southwesterly flow aloft without a
ridge. While the operational runs are dry there are enough wet
solutions in the ensembles to have a slight chance of rain in the
forecast for Thursday.

Highs Monday in the lower 70s over the southern portion with 60s
for the remainder of the area. Highs a little cooler Tuesday
through Thursday, in the lower to mid 60s. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough and occluded front will pass
through the region today. The flow ahead of the trough aloft will be
southwest, and will switch to northwest post trough late today. A
line of rain showers will progress from over the coastal waters
inland this morning. Moderate to heavy rainfall rates may drop
visibilities to IFR briefly at a few terminals. The main line of
rain will pass through late this morning, with ceilings dropping to
MVFR with the rain showers. Post front, a convergence zone is
expected in southern Snohomish County in the afternoon. Additional
showers will also linger in the northern terminals, and South
Interior. There is a low risk of thunder in the convergence zone,
however predictability is too low to include in the TAFs at this
time. Winds at the surface will also pick up this afternoon out of
the southwest, sustained at 10 to 15 kt with gusts to 20 kt
possible. Ceilings will improve later tonight to VFR as the front
clears. Winds will also decrease below 10 kt.

KSEA...A line of rain will pass through the terminal between 12Z and
18Z this morning. Moderate to heavy rainfall rates may briefly drop
visibilities into IFR criteria. Ceilings will drop to MVFR with the
rain. This afternoon`s convergence zone is expected to remain north
of the terminal (although a few additional showers are possible in
the afternoon). Winds will pick up this afternoon, peaking out of
the southwest at 10 to 15 kt gusting to 20 kt. Ceilings will improve
later this evening, and winds will diminish below 10 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weakening occluded front will sweep through the region
this morning/afternoon. A line of moderate to heavy rain continues
to move east over the coastal waters. Rainfall rates may temporarily
reduce visibilities to mariners over the waters as the line
progresses eastward this morning.

As the front moves through, seas are expected to build up to 9 to 11
feet at 10 seconds this afternoon. The steepest seas will be in the
outer coastal waters, and in the inner waterway zones from Cape
Elizabeth to Neah Bay in the western Strait of Juan de Fuca. The
small craft advisory continues with the elevated seas being the main
concern. For the inland waters, winds are expected to pick up this
afternoon in the central Strait of Juan de Fuca, with westerlies
increasing up to 25 kt, and possible gusts over 30 kt. With model
guidance showing the increase potential for westerlies making it
into the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca, the small craft advisory
was expanded to include the eastern section. Additionally, a couple
gusts up to 25 kt are possible in the Northern Inland Waters from
Birch Bay to Blanchard (though sustained winds are not expected to
exceed 20 kt).

Once the trough departs eastward, the seas will drop to 4 to 6 feet
through the weekend, building back to 6 to 8 feet next week. Winds
will drop to 5 to 10 kt.
