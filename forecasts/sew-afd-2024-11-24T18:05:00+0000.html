Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
1005 AM PST Sun Nov 24 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper-low will continue to churn off the PNW coast
for the start of the new week with active weather continuing. Drier
conditions expected towards the Thanksgiving holiday as an upper
level ridge brings calm weather but cooler temperatures.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Current satellite imagery very
clearly shows where the bulk of shower activity is this morning,
which, when paired with radar, indicates the majority of echoes
present south and east of the Sound. There is some activity over the
western half of the CWA, but it is far more scattered. Zooming out
some on the satellite, enough rotation is present to indicate the
position of the parent upper low which continues to spin over the
Pacific waters.

Model solutions remain consistent for the near term with both
deterministic and ensemble members slowly pulling aforementioned low
southward throughout the day today. This will allow the system to
draw moisture up into W WA to continue to fuel the shower risk today
and Monday. Once the low starts to make its way inland, models
remain in agreement that its storm track will take it more into
central or southern OR, thus taking its moisture with it. While this
may still allow for some showers to persist over portions of the
CWA, this will ultimately allow for lowering PoPs and drying
conditions for Tuesday.

High temps for the entirety of the short term lingering in the mid
50s to around 50 with overnight lows in the upper 30s to lower 40s.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...From Previous
Discussion...Drier conditions well into the week but NBM is keen on
keeping slight PoPs in the forecast. This can be attributed to
another subtle shortwave breaking off the ridge centered over the NE
PAC, entering around Thursday-Friday. Conditions are to also trend
cooler as widespread 30s show up in the overnight lows, possibly
near freezing towards the second half of the week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level low slowly drifting south offshore with
moist southwesterly flow aloft over the area. Light easterly
gradients in the lower levels.

Mostly VFR ceilings east of Puget Sound and MVFR ceilings west of
Puget Sound. Conditions slowly deteriorating east of Puget Sound
with MVFR ceilings all areas by 00z. MVFR ceilings continuing into
Monday morning. Possible IFR ceilings over the Kitsap Peninsula
with a little upslope flow into the OLympics.

KSEA...VFR ceilings becoming MVFR around 22z. MVFR ceilings
continuing overnight into MOnday morning. Easterly winds 4 to 8
knots becoming northeast after 09z. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...A 1000 millibar surface low west of Vancouver Island
will continue to gradually weaken today as it drifts slowly south.
However, winds for the most part will still remain within Small
Craft Advisory speeds for most zones. The low will fill and drift
in the Oregon coastal waters early this week as surface ridging
builds over the interior of British Columbia. Winds over western
Washington remain offshore throughout the period. 33

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The Skokomish River went barely back above flood
stage last night. With the light precipitation continuing into
Monday morning the river will remain near or just above flood
stage into Monday. The river will slowly recede beginning Monday
night dropping fell below flood stage Tuesday.

For the remainder of the rivers no flooding is expected at this
time with no hydrologically significant precipitation in the
forecast. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
