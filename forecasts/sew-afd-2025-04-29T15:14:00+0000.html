Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
814 AM PDT Tue Apr 29 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Cool and showery conditions are expected to linger
through this morning. Drier and warmer weather returns for
Wednesday and Thursday. Precipitation chances are back in the
forecast for Friday into next weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The latest forecast remains
on track this morning with no updates outside of the Aviation
section below. Showers will continue to linger over the Cascades
today with drying elsewhere. Highs today are expected to be in
the upper 50s and low 60s.

A ridge returns over the northeastern Pacific Wednesday into
Thursday for dry and warm weather. Highs on Wednesday will climb
into the mid to upper 60s and steadily higher yet on Thursday,
with highs in the mid to upper 70s. 80 degree temperatures are
likely in Cascade valleys and into the Southwest Interior.
For this time of year, temperatures reaching near 80 degrees does
put much of Puget Sound in the minor (yellow) HeatRisk category.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Another warm day (although
slightly less than Thursday) is expected on Friday. Pleasant
temperatures in the low 70s are expected, with upper 50s along the
coast. While the forecast has some light precipitation in for
Friday afternoon, at this point, it seems more showery and not
widespread. The timing of the next system has been pushed back,
with the track of the low and associated frontal system not
nearing the region until closer to early Saturday morning. The
core of the low pressure system seems to track into northern
California, for light rain to return in a more widespread fashion
on Saturday. QPF amounts will be light again, with about a quarter
of an inch favored in the Cascades.

Precipitation looks to taper off on Sunday, with split flow aloft
bringing mild conditions back through Monday.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough will move through WA this
afternoon. A warm front currently sits on the WA/Canadian border
this morning, with a cold front trailing just west of the Olympics.
Majority of terminals sit within the warm sector this morning (with
drizzle/light rain in some spots), and the increased moisture
continues to produce widespread pockets of IFR (with
sporadic/isolated spots of LIFR with visibilities as low as 1 mile
and ceilings down to as low as 300 ft). The lowest CIGs were being
observed from KHQM to KOLM, up through at least KPAE and over to
KFHR. Outside of this, remaining terminals report MVFR, but many of
them report SCT005. Timeframe for ceiling improvements to improve to
MVFR/VFR is 18-21Z (CIGs will scatter out in most spots). Once the
cold passes through, onshore flow will increase and may lead to
gusty winds at times along the coast and Strait of Juan de Fuca
(will shift more from the southwest to the west/northwest across the
region today at 5 to 10 kt (gusts to 18 kt possible along the
coast). The push Wednesday morning will likely bring CIGs back down
to MVFR Wednesday morning, before clearing out.

KSEA...Ceilings have dropped to LIFR this morning with visibilities
as low as a mile. Giving the slow trends towards improving to MVFR,
did roll back the TAF to show improvement later this morning/early
afternoon (should become VFR late this afternoon). Winds remain
southwesterly this morning at 6 to 10 kt. Shift to the
north/northwest is expected as early as 20Z.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak frontal system will move inland this morning
with onshore flow briefly increasing behind it as surface ridging
rebuilds across the coastal and offshore waters. The ridge will
remain in place over the coastal waters into Thursday producing
light onshore flow. A weak front will reach the waters at the end of
the week with possible wind-related headlines mainly for the coastal
waters.
