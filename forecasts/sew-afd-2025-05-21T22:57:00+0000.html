Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
357 PM PDT Wed May 21 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Increasing clouds tonight as a weak disturbance moves
across the region, with light rain possible south of Puget Sound and
in the mountains. A drier and warmer pattern develops late this week
and especially into the weekend with high pressure building overhead.
Confidence is lower for the start of next week, with the potential
for some rain showers returning.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showers have
largely decreased across the region with decreasing clouds this
afternoon and temperatures around the 60s this afternoon. Expect
clouds to again increase this afternoon as the next disturbance
shifts north and east across the region. While the increased
cloud cover will be the most impactful change to sensible
weather, shower chances will also increase for areas south of
Puget Sound and extending into the central Cascades late
tonight and into early Thursday. This disturbance will shift
eastward rather quickly, with much of the area dry by Thursday
evening (though showers likely linger in the Cascades Thursday
night). Otherwise, a shift in the pattern continues to appear
likely by Friday as high pressure begins to build into the
region. Mostly dry conditions Friday with temperatures returning
to near-normal values.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will
then continue to amplify over the Pacific Northwest this
weekend, bringing a steadier warmer and drier pattern.
Temperatures on Sunday are expected to climb well into the 70s
with the warmest spots even making a run at the 80 degree mark.
This is likely to be the warmest day of the stretch, with the
potential for the ridge to weaken early next week. The ensemble
guidance does begin to diverge next week, however, as the
solutions become split between a stubborn ridge and splitting
systems keeping the area mostly dry or the ridge weakening with
the next trough crossing the region. For now, rain chances
return by midweek with temperatures remaining near or slightly
above seasonal norms.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>VFR conditions across all the terminals this afternoon,
with these conditions persisting for the rest of today. A weather
system moving to our south into Oregon on Thursday will clip Western
Washington and bring increasing clouds. At this time confidence is
low on how low the ceilings will decrease, but there is a 10-35%
chance of MVFR ceilings between 14z-19z Thursday (the highest
chances along the coast). This system will bring a small chance of
light rain showers, with the latest high-res guidance having the
majority of the rain concentrated south of KSEA and along the
foothills of the Cascades.

N/NW surface winds this afternoon at 5-9 kt. Winds will shift
overnight more NE and subside, ranging from calm to 3-5 kt. Westerly
flow establishes late Thursday morning/early afternoon.

KSEA...VFR this afternoon and expected to continue for the rest of
the day. Cloud cover will increase overnight as a system moves well
to the south of the terminal, bringing a small chance of 10% of MVFR
ceilings around 14z-18z. Otherwise, VFR conditions expected to
prevail.

N/NW surface flow 7-9 kt, subsiding overnight to 3-4 kt and shifting
more NE. Surface winds will shift more westerly late Thursday
morning/early afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the coastal waters will weaken slightly
today as a surface low moves towards Oregon and Northern California.
Northwesterly flow across the coastal waters will increase this
evening to around 10-15 kt and gradually subside into Thursday
morning. High pressure rebuilds over the waters on Thursday and
persists into the weekend. Model guidance shows a low pressure
system may try to move over the coastal waters on Friday; however,
at this time it looks like it will dissipate before it reaches the
coastal waters. Diurnal westerly pushes across the Strait of Juan de
Fuca will also occur over the next few days (starting on Thursday).
At this time, sustained winds and gusts look to remain below small
craft criteria. The next frontal system will move over the coastal
waters on Monday.

Seas hovering around 6-7 ft this afternoon will continue to subside
into Thursday and Friday to around 3-5 ft. Going into the weekend,
seas will rise slightly to around 5-7 ft and persist into early next
week.
