Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
930 AM PDT Fri May 23 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A building upper ridge will lead to warmer and
drier conditions across Western Washington through the end of
the week. A weak front will produce a few showers and cooler
temperatures on Memorial Day before upper ridging brings a
return to drier conditions and warming temperatures into the
middle portion of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak zonal flow aloft will
be replaced by upper ridging later today as the synoptic
pattern amplifies in response to an upper trough digging
southward offshore around 140W. The end result will be a short
term warming and drying trend heading into the first portion of
the upcoming holiday weekend. Residual clouds will clear away
most areas by this afternoon for mostly sunny skies and
temperatures similar to those of yesterday...right around
climatological norms. The warming trend commences in earnest
Saturday with 60s for the coast and widespread 70s for the
interior lowlands from around Everett southward. The upper ridge
will weaken on Sunday and onshore gradients will increase a
couple notches ahead of an approaching weak front. This will put
a proverbial lid on temperatures, but it should be a pretty
pleasant day with dry conditions across the area. A weakening
front will approach the coastal waters by Sunday evening and may
spread a few showers onto the North Coast.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A previously
advertised weak upper trough and associated front will move
across Western Washington on Monday with showers and high
temperatures cooling back into the 60s for the lowland areas.
But the upper trough doesn`t stick around for long as upper
ridging is expected to rebuild into the area Monday night into
Tuesday. With clearing skies, temperatures should bounce back
into the mid 60s to lower 70s for much of Western Washington on
Tuesday. Ensembles are in fairly good agreement that the upper
ridge will continue to build more strongly across the region
moving into the middle of next week with 500 millibar heights
potentially crossing the 580 decameter threshold and 850
millibar temperatures warming to around 16 to 18 C. So, what
does that all mean? Seattle could see it`s first 80 F
temperatures of the year. Average first occurrence is May
20th...so only slightly behind schedule. Ensembles are split
with the idea of another front trying to reach the area late
next week. High amplitude upper ridging may be slow to get
nudged eastward...which lends a substantial element of
uncertainty to the forecast by that timeframe. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft today. Upper level trough digging
south well offshore with corresponding upper level ridge building
over Western Washington overnight turning the flow aloft
southwesterly. Upper level ridge moves east Saturday with
southwesterly flow aloft continuing. Light onshore flow in the
lower levels.

VFR/MVFR ceilings this morning with a broken stratus deck around
4500 feet. Local MVFR ceilings in the 2000-3000 foot range 15z-18z.
Stratus deck scattering out 18z-21z with mostly clear skies into
Saturday morning.

KSEA...VFR ceilings mainly near 4000 feet this morning but a
transient BKN deck around 2000 ft is hovering about. Clouds
scattering out 18z-21z with mostly clear skies for the remainder of
the day into Saturday morning. Southwest wind 4 to 8 knots becoming
northwest around 00z and northeast around 06z. Felton/McMillian<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the waters through Saturday with a
frontal system moving inland north of Vancouver Island. The
high will weaken Sunday with a weak front moving through the
waters Sunday night into Monday morning. High pressure will
rebuild Monday night and Tuesday. The front late in the weekend
does not look strong enough to create small craft advisory
conditions over the waters. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
