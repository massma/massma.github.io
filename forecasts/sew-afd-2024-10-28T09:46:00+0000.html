Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
246 AM PDT Mon Oct 28 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showery, cool conditions will gradually taper off today
as an upper level trough passes over the region. Briefly drier
conditions will develop Monday night and Tuesday before a vigorous
frontal system produces additional rain, mountain snow, and locally
windy conditions midweek. A trend toward somewhat drier conditions
is expected by the end of the week into the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Scattered showers and
isolated thunderstorms continue across western Washington as a low
pressure, currently centered over the northern tip of Vancouver
Island, moves south across the area and weakens. Showers will
continue throughout the day today, finally tapering off tonight.
With snow levels right around 4000 ft, higher elevation passes will
see some light snow accumulations, with the most snow expected
across the North Cascades. Breezy winds will also be able to
subside this morning.

A transient shortwave ridge will build over the area Monday night
into Tuesday, allowing conditions to mostly dry out. Another cold
front will follow close by, bringing another shot of rain and
breezy winds on Wednesday. With lowering snow levels to around
3500 ft, mountain passes (including Stevens Pass) have better
chances of receiving significant accumulating snow. Overall the
QPF forecast is a bit lower, with around a quarter to three-
quarters of an inch through the lowlands, and up to around 2
inches through the mountains and along the Pacific coast.

Overall, the temperatures remain consistent, with highs in the
mid 50s and lows in the upper 30s to low 40s.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...The parent low pressure
system will move southward into the region on Thursday, keeping rain
and mountain snow showers in the forecast, though mostly in the
southern portions of the region. Looking at the upper level pattern,
the associated upper level trough will move through on Thursday,
with an upper level trough that looks to form over the East
Pacific late week and move into our area by this weekend. The mean
solution indicates that this weekend will be mostly dry, through
there are hints of a potential shortwave trough that may move
through the ridge, keeping slight chances of precipitation through
the weekend as well. Temperatures continue to remain consistent
with highs in the mid 50s and lows in the upper 30s to low 40s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft will gradually become more
northwesterly today as an upper trough axis pushes inland and
shortwave upper ridging nudges into the area tonight. Radar shows
scattered showers across the region early this morning. Expect showers
to generally diminish throughout the day, however guidance
indicates some convergence zone showers developing this evening
across King/Snohomish counties. Isolated thunderstorms will be
possible through this evening, however confidence is too low for
inclusion in the TAFs at this time. Ceilings are generally
expected to be a mix of VFR to MVFR across the area through the
morning, before generally improving to more widespread VFR by the
afternoon hours. Brief reductions in ceilings and visibilities
will remain possible throughout the day in any heavier shower
activity, however. Breezy southerly winds will ease through the
day, persisting at 5-10 kts by this afternoon.

KSEA...Predominantly VFR ceilings, though rain showers will remain
possible throughout the day and may bring brief reductions in
ceilings and visibilities at times. Southerly winds will ease
towards 5-10 kts by this afternoon. Convergence zone may sink
south into the terminal tonight, bringing light, variable winds
between 02-05Z. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The pattern remains active as a low pressure system
moves southward along British Columbia today and then moves inland
by this evening. Breezy winds will gradually continue to ease
across the interior waters through the morning hours today. Winds
look to remain breezy along the outer coastal waters through much
of the day, however the bigger impact remains the seas - which
continue to range between 14-18 ft early this morning. As a
result, have extended the small craft advisories in effect
through this evening for the coastal waters (for winds and seas)
and the West Entrance of the Strait of Juan de Fuca (for seas).
Rough to very steep conditions will continue on Grays Harbor Bar
today as well.

High pressure returns to the coastal waters on Tuesday, allowing
for winds to ease and for seas to subside. The reprieve remains
short-lived, however, as a strong frontal system arrives by
Wednesday and brings another round of strong winds and significantly
building seas. Latest guidance indicates a 60-70 percent chance
of gales across the coastal waters and eastern Strait as the
frontal system moves across the region on Wednesday. The next Gulf
of Alaska low will quickly follow, dropping southward into the
region on Thursday before moving inland Thursday night into
Friday. Seas look to build back towards 16-18 ft by Thursday
morning and look to gradually subside through Friday. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
