Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
416 AM PST Tue Feb 25 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Rain, strong winds, and heavy mountain snow will
continue today as a low pressure system offshore moves inland
this morning. Conditions will dry out heading into Wednesday as
upper level ridging starts to build back into the area. A weak
front approaching the region on Thursday may bring some light
showers to western Washington before conditions dry out again on
Friday. Chances of light precipitation are possible over the
weekend as additional systems move into the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows a
broad cyclone just west of the Western Strait of Juan de Fuca
early this morning, accompanied by a 992mb surface low. The low
will continue to fill and push inland between Vancouver Island and
the Strait of Juan de Fuca this morning, and will continue to
bring lowland rain, mountain snow, gusty winds, and high surf to
portions of western Washington today. Details on the hazards have
been outlined below:

Winds: The strongest winds so far have occurred along the coast,
where the Hoquiam ASOS reported a wind gust to 70 mph and the
Quillayute ASOS reported a gust to 62 mph. Winds across the
interior will continue to increase over the next hour or so,
where southerly wind gusts to 50-55 mph will remain possible over
through the early morning hours. Winds will peak through the early
morning period, but will remain gusty as they gradually ease
throughout the afternoon hours today. Downed trees and power
outages will remain possible.

Rain: Widespread rain is currently pushing across the western
Washington lowlands this morning. Expect rain to become more
showery in nature by the late morning hours. High res guidance
does indicate a Puget Sound Convergence Zone likely developing
across Snohomish County by this afternoon. Additional rainfall
totals through tonight generally look to range from a quarter of
an inch to half an inch for areas across the northern coast and
northern interior and from half an inch to 1.25 inches for areas
across the southern coast and southern interior, though locally
higher rainfall totals will be possible in any heavier banding
that does develop. Showers will then taper across the region by
tonight.

Mountain Snow: Significant snowfall is likely across the
mountains today as snow levels hover between 3000-4000 feet.
Higher elevation passes like Stevens and White will likely see  a
foot or more of snow, with areas like Paradise likely seeing a
few feet of fresh snow. Snow levels look to increase towards 3500
feet during the day, so expect snowfall amounts to be a bit lower
near Snoqualmie Pass - where amounts are generally expected to
range between 8-12 inches. Snowfall amounts and rates will be
higher in any precipitation banding that develops.

High Surf: Buoy observations overnight have reported significant
wave heights around 30 feet just offshore. Large waves will
along the coast may bring significant erosion to coastal beaches
and may wash over beaches, jetties, and other structures
unexpectedly. Expect large waves to gradually subside this
afternoon.

The low pressure system will exit the area this evening. This
will allow for upper level ridging to start to build back into the
region by Wednesday for much calmer conditions across western
Washington. With ample moisture remaining the low levels from
recent rains, any clearing overnight will allow for areas of fog
to develop across the interior by early Wednesday morning. Expect
fog to scatter by the late morning and for afternoon high
temperatures to warm into the mid to upper 50s - with some spots
expected to warm to near 60.

A weak front then looks to approach the region on Thursday, but
looks to split and break up over western Washington. A few showers
will be possible across the area as a result, though expect
precipitation amounts to remain rather light at a few hundredths
of an inch for most spots. Areas along the coast may see a tenth
or two of an inch. High temperatures on Thursday will again be in
the mid to upper 50s, with a few areas expected to near 60.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Upper level ridging will
rebuild over the area on Friday and will bring a dry start to the
long term period. High temperatures will be in the upper 50s with
lows in the upper 30s to low 40s. Drier conditions do not look to
last too long however, as the upper level ridge axis shifts inland
on Saturday and makes way for an upper level trough moving into
the region. This will reintroduce chance of showers to western
Washington over the weekend. While there is still a decent amount
of uncertainty in the exact evolution of the pattern, precipitation
amounts at this time generally look to remain light with no
significant impacts expected at this time. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A mix of ceilings of VFR/MVFR ceilings as rain continues
to move across the terminals associated with a strong low pressure
system. Reduced visibility and lower ceilings into IFR are possible
during the heavier bands of precipitation. Rain will gradually
subside throughout Tuesday afternoon/evening. Guidance hints at MVFR
persisting through the remainder of the TAF period. In addition,
guidance hints at IFR/LIFR on early Wednesday morning with the
possibility (30-40%) of patchy fog developing along Puget Sound and
Kitsap Peninsula.

Gusty southwesterly winds are expected to persist into Tuesday
morning. Winds with sustained speeds of 15-25 kt, gusting to 30-35
kt and to 40 kt along the coast. Winds will subside throughout the
afternoon and  will decrease to 5-7 kt by late Tuesday evening.
Winds will gradually shift northeast after 8Z Wednesday.

KSEA...Rain will continue to move across the terminal through
Tuesday afternoon/evening. Currently MVFR and expecting these
conditions to persist through the remainder of the TAF period.
Guidance hints at possible IFR/LIFR conditions (20-30% chance)
between 12Z-18Z Wednesday as patchy fog may develop across Puget
Sound.

Gusty southwesterly winds expected to into the morning hours with
speeds of 15-25 kt and gusts up to 35-45 kt. Winds will gradually
decrease in the afternoon and by Tuesday evening to 6-7 kt. Winds
will gradually shift northeasterly Wednesday morning and remain
light at 2-4 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong low pressure system is bringing unsettled marine
conditions. A series of headlines (Storm Force Warnings and Gale
Force Warnings) are currently in effect for elevated winds across
the coastal and inner waters. Winds will begin to subside Tuesday
morning to Small Craft criteria. High pressure will build Tuesday
afternoon offshore, easing marine conditions. A weak system will
glide across the offshore waters on Wednesday night into early
Thursday morning.

Combined seas will build to 20-32 ft, with the highest waves along
the southern coastal waters. Waves will subside throughout the day
on Tuesday into Wednesday to 10-12 ft. Combined seas appear to
decrease below 10 ft Friday into Saturday.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A flood watch remains in effect for Lewis, Thurston
and Grays Harbor counties through this afternoon. Steady rain
coming to an end this morning over the Southwest Interior.
Forecast crests for the Newaukum River near Chehalis, Chehalis at
Grand Mound and the Chehalis at Porter are currently within about
a half a foot of flood stage. Too close to call at this point.
The forecast trend is for the rivers to remain below flood stage
but with more rain yet to come in next few hours will leave watch
up for another forecast package.

A flood warning remains in effect for the Skokomish River near
Potlatch in Mason county. The river will crest in the moderate
flood stage category late this morning and will remain above flood
stage through at least Wednesday morning.

No river flooding expected Thursday into the first part of next
week.

Some rainfall stats for Seattle. Total precipitation first 46
days of the year ( Jan 1 thru Feb 15 ), 2.61 inches. Total
rainfall last 10 days ( Feb 16 through 3 am this morning ), 2.68
