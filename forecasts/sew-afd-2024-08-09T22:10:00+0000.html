Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
310 PM PDT Fri Aug 9 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Warmer conditions will linger into Saturday for the
interior with cooler conditions along the coast. Afternoon and
evening thunderstorms over the Cascades today and tomorrow, with
areas of lofted smoke and haze will continue into Saturday as
well. Onshore flow will bring much cooler - below normal - conditions
Sunday into next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/... <span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Hazy skies this afternoon
with warm temperatures well into the 80s this afternoon despite
the hazy conditions. The Heat Advisory remains in effect through 9
PM this evening, highlighting potential impacts due to the warm
conditions. In addition, thunderstorms have been popping up along
the crest of the Cascades this afternoon and will likely continue
into the evening. The Red Flag Warning remains in effect for this
area, refer to the fire weather discussion for further info.

Increasing low level onshore flow will bring initial cooling
especially for the coast Saturday. Temperatures over much of the
interior are expected to remain above normal, with another warm, hazy
day with highs reaching into the mid 80s. As westerly flow
becomes more established this will help push some of the elevated
smoke out of the area, but this make take a bit of time to have
much effect... more likely into Sunday. The Cascades are expected
to see another 15 to 20% chance of thunderstorms, mainly along the
crest Saturday afternoon into the evening. Onshore flow will
increase further into Sunday, more developed morning stratus and with
more widespread cooler conditions, resulting in near normal
temperatures in the mid 70s for the interior and 60s along the
coast.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...The large scale pattern
continues to trend towards troughing over the Pacific Northwest
early next week and typical low level onshore flow. Ensembles
support this trend - highlighting below normal temperatures
during this period and limited precipitation potential.
Widespread morning clouds are the safe bet with even the potential
for limited drizzle. Temperatures next week will range in the mid
60s along the coast to mid 70s for the interior area.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft today before turning more
northwesterly into Saturday with upper level troughing over western
Washington. VFR conditions across almost all of the area, except
some lingering stratus at KHQM and along the immediate coastline.
Thunderstorms have also developed along and just east of the Cascade
crest, which will continue through this evening. The marine stratus
layer will rebuild back east through the night, bringing IFR to
LIFR conditions with it. With stronger onshore flow expected
tonight, stratus is expected to reach the interior terminals by
Saturday morning.Winds west/northwesterly 4 to 8 kt today before
becoming light southwesterly to calm again tonight. Winds should be
a bit stronger tomorrow (5 to 10 kt). Haze from wildfire smoke will
remain present in the atmosphere but is not expected to reduce
surface visibility.

KSEA...VFR conditions through most of the TAF period with
west to northwesterly winds. Winds remain light overnight,
becoming southwesterly. Another push of marine stratus may be able
to briefly impact the terminal around 10-12Z Saturday, with a 20-30%
probability of ceilings below MVFR through 18Z. Any stratus that
does develop should scatter out by 18Z, leaving continued VFR
conditions for Saturday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the East Pacific with lower pressure
over land will allow for northwesterly onshore flow to continue with
diurnally driven pushes of westerly winds down the Strait of Juan de
Fuca. High resolution guidance is indicating that the push this
afternoon should largely remain under Small Craft Advisory
threshold, through there exists a 30-40% chance for some
occasional SCA gusts this evening. The push Saturday evening looks
to be more substantial, with a 40-50% chance for sustained winds to
reach SCA criteria.

Seas currently 4 ft at 7 seconds. Seas will increase Saturday
evening into Sunday as winds increase over the coastal waters,
reaching 6 to 8 ft. With the dominant period being around 8 seconds,
seas will be steep and look to approach steepness criteria for a
SCA. Seas will subside back to 3 to 5 ft on Monday and into next
week.

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level shortwave trough will brush
Washington to the north today and make its way eastward over the
weekend. Thunderstorms have started to develop along the Cascade
crest this afternoon and expect thunderstorm activity to continue
through this evening. While guidance continues to suggest a 10-20%
chance of thunderstorms across the Olympics today, highest
probabilities for thunderstorm development remain across the
North Cascades at this time. Main threats with any thunderstorms
are lightning and gusty and erratic winds. Lightning strikes will
have the potential to create new fire starts.

A Red Flag Warning remains in effect for the North Cascades zone
658 for thunderstorms and gusty outflow winds through this
evening. Isolated thunderstorms have also developed this
afternoon across zone 659 and may continue to develop,
particularly near Mount Rainier, however, thunderstorm coverage
continues to look more isolated for this area.

Threats for thunderstorms will continue across portions of the
Cascades through the weekend, however chances will gradually wane
as the shortwave moves off to the east. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
