Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
313 PM PDT Mon Oct 21 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showers continue overnight across western Washington
as an upper level disturbance crosses the region. Drier conditions
expected Tuesday into early Wednesday. Cold morning temperatures
possible early Wednesday and again Thursday morning. Active
weather with widespread precipitation likely to return late in
the week through the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/... <span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Broad upper level
troughing over Washington extending south and west well into the
Pacific will linger into mid week. An embedded disturbance will
swing across western Washington this afternoon and evening
enhancing showers with a chance of isolated thunderstorms mainly
across the south from around Grays Harbor inland through the I-5
corridor from around Tacoma southward. The upper trough then
swings across the area tonight through early Tuesday, with some
lingering showers becoming mostly confined to the mountains.
Cooler conditions will also linger over the next few days with
snow levels dipping to around 5000 ft.

A slight bump in upper level heights Tuesday will bring mostly
dry conditions and a likely decrease in cloud cover in the
afternoon and into Tuesday night. With weak high pressure and
clearing skies, this will provide for efficient radiational
cooling which could bring overnight temperatures into the mid 30s
in many outlying areas away from the urban centers by daybreak
Wednesday. Some patchy areas of frost can`t be ruled out in some
of the typically cooler sheltered locations. This will again be
the case Wednesday night into Thursday morning - though the
potential for for cloud cover could inhibit this going into the
early morning hours Thursday.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Ensemble guidance remains
fairly consolidated on the a pattern shift late in the week with
deepening low in the Gulf of Alaska and a frontal system reaching
the Pacific Northwest by around Friday. This potentially more
impactful period of weather into the weekend includes what looks
to be another deep plume of moisture aimed somewhere in the
region this weekend. Current ensemble guidance is framing this
system as a weaker atmospheric river pattern not uncommon to the
Pacific Northwest in early Fall.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft will become westerly tonight
as an upper level trough moves onshore. Scattered showers continue
across the southwestern portions of the area as a weak low pressure
system moves onshore. Ceilings across the area are a mixed bag
between MVFR and VFR. Ceilings will likely remain broken and in the
low VFR/high MVFR range through most of the rest of the day and
early evening before more widespread MVFR to locally IFR conditions
redevelop tonight. Shower activity will diminish through the early
morning hours tomorrow. Some fog/low stratus development is expected
in the fog-prone spots Tuesday morning including OLM and PWT. Skies
will begin to clear out more on Tuesday, with a return to widespread
VFR conditions.
Winds are fairly light today, variable at times but generally from
the south/southwest. Winds remain light through the evening, turning
to become light northerly tomorrow.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings are expected to persist this afternoon, lifting
to VFR early this evening with scattered showers remaining in the
area. Ceilings are expected to lower again late this evening into
early Tuesday morning to MVFR. Surface winds light early this
morning becoming S/SW 5 to 9 knots this afternoon and evening.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak low pressure system will continue to move onshore
over southwestern Washington this afternoon, brining with it
scattered showers a low (10-20% probability) chance of an isolated
thunderstorm. A broad surface ridge will begin to build into the
area Tuesday and remain like so through Thursday for rather tranquil
conditions across the waters. The ridge is then expected to shift
east of the Cascades late in the week as a broad and potentially
deep trough moves into the offshore/coastal waters for a return to
active conditions and possible headlines. Seas remain 4 to 6 ft
through most of the week, then beginning to rise close to 10 ft
Saturday as that system approaches the area.

LH<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Rivers will continue to recede over the next few
days. Ongoing showers will continue overnight, with expected amounts
on the order of 0.25 to 0.50 inches with little or no impact on
area rivers beyond slowing the drop in flows on many rivers.
Additional river flooding is not expected through the week ahead.
Another round of potentially heavier rainfall is possible over the
weekend, but confidence in the placement of heavy rain remains
low at this time.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
