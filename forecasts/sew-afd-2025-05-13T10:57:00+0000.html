Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
357 AM PDT Tue May 13 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A broad upper level trough will gradually advance eastward, with
drier conditions for areas other than the mountains Tuesday.
Another disturbance will bring additional shower chances
Wednesday, and several additional systems arriving later in the
week through next weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>As of early this morning, mostly dry conditions with only a few
isolated showers mostly confined near the Cascades. As the main
upper low shifts eastward today, expect that any showers will be
limited to a few scattered over the higher terrain. Otherwise,
areas of low stratus again developing along the coast and into
portions of the interior, which will likely remain into the
mid-morning hours before gradual improvement occurs this
afternoon.

Overall, not much change in the pattern into Wednesday, though
coverage may increase a bit as an embedded shortwave clips the
northern portion of the area. High temperatures will remain in
the lower to mid 60s for the interior, with mid to upper 50s for
the coast and water adjacent locations. A deeper disturbance
arrives again around Thursday, ushering in a more widespread
chance of rain showers across the region.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
Generally decent agreement in the ensemble guidance for the end
of the week with another broad upper trough bringing additional
rain to the region this weekend. While QPF remains on the lower
side, a generally cool and showery pattern will be the most likely
result for the region into the start of next week. Temperatures
hold fairly consistent through the long term, generally holding
in the lower to mid 60s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>North to northwesterly flow aloft over W WA today before turning
more northwesterly early Wednesday. Surface winds a mix between
light and variable at some terminals while others leaning
toward south-southwesterly with speeds ranging 4-8 kts. HQM and
CLM being exceptions to both with westerly winds ranging 5-10
kts. More uniform southerlies expected by mid-morning with
speeds generally 6- 12 kts.

Widespread VFR conditions in place save for along the coast and at
PAE, where low clouds have reduced conditions to MVFR. More
widespread MVFR conditions expected to emerge by 12Z as low level
moisture continues to seep in. Once these lower cigs take hold, will
be a little slow with recovery, with VFR conditions expected to
finally re-emerge by the mid-afternoon. Lower cigs expected to
return overnight tonight.

KSEA...VFR conditions in place for now. Current TAF has cigs falling
to MVFR around 12Z, which looking at obs and satellite may be a hair
agressive...but the 12-14Z time frame still seems reasonable. Cigs
expected to fall around 2000 feet before slowly lifting back up to
VFR after around 20Z. Surface wind discussion from above applies.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the coastal waters with lower pressure
inland will remain intact through Wednesday night, allowing for
westerly pushes down the Strait both this afternoon and Wednesday
afternoon. Forecast has SCA winds for both time frames and as such,
will issue a new SCA to cover this afternoon through overnight. A
follow up headline for Wednesday may be needed, but will leave for
future shifts to determine. Frontal system moving through the waters
later Thursday into Thursday night. High pressure will build over
the coastal waters for the weekend.

Northwest winds 15 to 25 mph with seas 10 to 12 feet over the outer
Coastal Waters today...and enough of a spill-over when it comes to
seas may impact portions of the inner coastal waters. As such, felt
expansion of the inherited SCA there was warranted. Both the winds
and seas will subside tonight with no headline criteria expected
afterward for the remainder of the week. 18<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
