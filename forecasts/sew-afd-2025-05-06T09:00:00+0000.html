Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
200 AM PDT Tue May 6 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure aloft will lead to another dry and
warm day across Western Washington. A weak system will arrive on
Wednesday bringing cooler temperatures and chances for showers.
Somewhat warmer and generally dry conditions return late week
before another front reaches the region over the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge axis
will slide across the area this morning and thermally induced low
pressure at the surface along the coast will shift inland this
afternoon. High temperatures will reach their zenith for the week
under mostly sunny skies. The low level flow will turn onshore
this evening ahead of an approaching front. Temperatures will
take a tumble on Wednesday under mostly cloudy skies and a
scattering of showers and/or drizzle. The weakening front will
gradually shift inland by late Wednesday afternoon with onshore
flow ramping up further in its wake and a likely convergence zone
developing into Wednesday evening. Onshore gradients relax on
Thursday and heights recover modestly for some partial late day
clearing, but temperatures will remain in the cool side...near or
a little below normal.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Upper ridging centered well
to our south makes a minor comeback on Friday as 500 millibar
heights recover to near 570 decameters with light flow in the low
levels. Interior areas look to remain mild and relatively dry on
Saturday, but cloud cover will likely increase with some precip
possible along the coast by Saturday evening. There is good
ensemble agreement with the idea of measurable precip areawide on
Sunday as a decent late season front moves across the area. A
broad and relatively deep upper trough will dig southward just
offshore on Monday to ensure that cool temperatures and the threat
of showers will remain in the forecast. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest flow aloft continues as a ridge remains in
place. Surface winds have been north to northeasterly at 4 to 7 kts,
and are expected to remain that way through the TAF period. Surface
winds are more westerly along the coast for continued onshore flow.
VFR cigs also prevailing through the TAF period.

KSEA...VFR and northerly flow between 7 and 9 kts early this
morning. Flow becoming more northwesterly after 18Z, but remaining
VFR. Surface winds today will be between 5 and 8 kts.

21<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure building over the coastal waters
will bring benign marine conditions through today. A weak frontal
system will traverse the waters on Wednesday. Surface winds over the
coastal waters will remain below 21 kt, however, a westerly push
across the Strait of Juan de Fuca will lead to sustained winds
speeds into the 21 to 30 kt range, with the strongest winds along
the Central Strait. High pressure will rebuild over the region
Thursday into Saturday, bringing calmer conditions over the waters.

Seas generally between 5 to 6 ft will through Tuesday, and will rise
to 7 to 8 ft on Wednesday. Conditions will ease on Thursday, with
seas returning back to 5 to 6 ft through the weekend.
