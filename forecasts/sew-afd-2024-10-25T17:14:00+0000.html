.PREV DISCUSSION... <span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>/issued 319 AM PDT Fri Oct 25 2024/

.SYNOPSIS...A ridge overhead is maintaining dry weather until
Friday night. Unsettled conditions will return and persist
throughout the weekend with gusty winds, rain, chance of thunder,
and mountain snow. Temporary relief from precipitation on Tuesday
as high pressure rebounds. However, another round of active
weather returns middle of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Good morning, western
Washington. Temperatures at a few locations at this hour:

Quillayute 39 F
Friday Harbor 46 F
NAS Whidbey Island 36 F

Upper-ridging will peak today as its axis progress across the PNW.
With it, we`ll see one last dry day in the short-term forecast.
High temperatures will top out into the upper 50s to mid 60s,
several degrees warmer compared to yesterday`s. Although
conditions are to be mostly benign, mid to high level cloud
coverage streaming overhead will be associated with our next
weather maker arriving Friday night.

Deterministic guidance is in good agreement with the movement and
intensity of a sub 995 mb surface low tracking over the offshore
waters into Vancouver Island Friday night/early Saturday morning.
Widespread rainfall will accompany this disturbance. Rain will
reach the coast during Friday evening before spreading inland
overnight. Along with precipitation, a strong offshore gradient
will set up as a response to the deep low with windy conditions
expected for portions of W WA. A Wind Advisory continues over the
North Coast (Neah Bay, La Push, Forks, etc.) and Admiralty Inlet
this evening into Saturday morning. San Juan County has been added
in this latest forecast package with similar timing. These
locations have the potential of seeing gusts upwards of 40-50 mph
with a 20-30% chance of gusts exceeding 55 mph given latest hi-res
ensemble data. Power outages may result along with tree damage
and the scattering of unsecured outdoor objects.

Rainfall will break into showers throughout the day on Saturday as
the surface low tracks off and away. Temperatures will trend
slightly cooler as they`ll cap in the mid 50s to lower 60s. Then,
another shot of rain looks to arrive on Saturday night as the
next front enters. It`ll be accompanied by a deep upper-level
trough as it begins to sink over the region on Sunday. Cooler
temperatures aloft are expected, brining a slight chance (15-20%)
of thunderstorms as lapse rates steepen. Highs will continue to
trend cooler as values cap within the 50s. Overnight lows are to
remain in the 40s and 50s throughout the short term.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...A broad upper-level trough
will continue overhead on Monday as it expands across much of the
western US. Snow levels will fall to 4,000-4,500 ft with light
snowfall possible for higher elevations as showers and the chance
for thunderstorms remain in the forecast. Conditions will trend
drier on Tuesday as transient ridging takes hold. But, the next
disturbance looks to enter on Wednesday and persisting into
Thursday as the parade of storms continue.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light northerly flow this morning with VFR cigs
presently across all terminals. Surface flow will transition from
light northerly to increasing south/southeasterly this afternoon
ahead of the next frontal system. This system will spread a period
of gusty winds and shower activity across the region overnight into
Saturday. Expect the windiest locations to be along the coast and
north interior. Wind and CIG Conditions are likely to improve
somewhat Saturday morning but will deteriorate again Saturday night
into Sunday morning as another system moves through.

KSEA...VFR this morning, with northeasterly winds maintained between
generally under 10 kts. Winds are likely to become southerly to
southeasterly after 22z ahead of an approaching frontal system. CIGS
will lower, showers will develop, and gusts will become more
prevalent overnight after 07z. A brief period of improvement is
possible Saturday morning through mid afternoon before deteriorating
again Saturday late afternoon and evening. Breezy and rainy
conditions will characterize the majority of the weekend.

.MARINE...High pressure continues to remain over the waters
resulting in rather benign conditions through much of today,
although more significant changes are imminent.

A robust frontal system will start to approach the area waters this
afternoon, with southerly winds increasing over waters. The previous
small craft advisory over the coastal waters, northern inland waters
and Strait of Juan de Fuca have been upgraded to gale warnings as
the ensembles were in better agreement over stronger winds sooner.
Winds through the Strait of Juan de Fuca will be easterly ahead of
the front, with model guidance suggesting a negative five pressure
gradient from BLI to UIL.

Winds throughout Puget Sound remained borderline on criteria, and
have opted not to issue a headline for it at this time. Another area
that will need to be evaluated further will be rough bar conditions
for Grays Harbor as the frontal system moves through the area. The
10 ft seas are just outside of the bar area, but could easily
elevate and warrant a headline.

Coastal seas today are around 3 to 6 feet, but will start to build
upwards to 13 to 15 feet tonight into Saturday. The highest seas
will be focused mainly in the outer water zones (13 to 15 feet)
meanwhile, seas 9 to 12 feet will be focused more in the inner water
zones, closer to the coast. Seas look to remain 10+ into the first
half of next week.

.HYDROLOGY...A frontal system will move into Western Washington
Friday night with unsettled weather, and periods of steadier
precipitation, through Monday. Snow levels will rise to 7000 to 8000
feet on Saturday, before falling to near 4000 feet on Monday.
QPF totals during this period are expected to range 2 to 4 inches
across the Olympics and Cascades, leading to a rise in area rivers.
At this time, river flooding is not expected. However, rivers will
continue to be monitored, particularly the Skokomish River this
weekend.
