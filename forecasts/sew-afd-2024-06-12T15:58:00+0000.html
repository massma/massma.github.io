.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Satellite imagery shows skies
clearing over the southern portion of the area with mostly cloudy
skies over the northern portion. With the clearing skies
temperatures have dropped into the lower 40s over the Southwest
Interior. Temperatures over the remainder of the area at 3 am/10z
were in the mid 40s to lower 50s.

Not much going on today. Zonal flow aloft with low level onshore
flow. Clouds over the northern portion of the area will eventually
scatter out. Even with the sunshine low level onshore flow will
keep highs only in the 60s.

Weak upper level ridge building over Western Washington tonight in
response to a large cool upper level low beginning to move
southeast out of the Gulf of Alaska. It will be cool morning for
June with the lack of cloud cover overnight. Lows mostly in the
40s with the coldest locations dropping into the upper 30s.

Upper level ridge over Western Washington Thursday for another dry
day. Continuation of the low level onshore flow will keep highs
in the 60s and lower 70s even with plenty of sunshine.

Upper level ridge well to the east by later Thursday night. Upper
level low continuing to move southeast and by late Friday will be
near Vancouver Island. Front spinning out of the low moving
through Western Washington Friday with showers likely along the
coast and over the higher terrain with a chance of showers in the
lowlands. Highs will cool back into the upper 50s to mid 60s.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The title of the extended
forecast could be Juneuary returns. Extended models remaining
consistent with the upper level low moving over Western Washington
Saturday and hanging around the area Sunday. If anything the
models are starting to indicate the low might hang around a little
longer into Sunday night/Monday morning. Cool showery weather
both days over the weekend with highs in the mid 50s to lower 60s.
Air mass aloft very cool with 500 mb temperatures -25C to -29C.
Lapse rates plus 7C to 8C and lifted indexes at or below 0. Chance
of thunderstorms already in the forecast for Saturday. Have added
a slight chance for thunderstorms to the forecast for Sunday
afternoon and evening. Low drifts away to the east Monday but not
far enough to eliminate the threat of wrap around moisture making
its way back into Western Washington for a chance of showers.
Weak upper level trough over the area Monday night into Tuesday
keeping a chance of showers in the forecast. Highs Monday in the
mid 50s to lower 60s, Tuesday lower to mid 60s. Felton

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly winds easing aloft as zonal flow to weak
ridging returns. VFR conditions persist across western Washington
this morning with a broken low-level deck at around 5000 ft. This
deck will hang around through this morning, breaking up late
morning into the afternoon. Surface winds generally out of the
N/NE, picking up to around 8 to 12 kt today before easing again
tonight.

KSEA...VFR conditions this morning with a 5000 ft cloud deck.
This cloud deck will remain through the morning, with some scattered
lower clouds possible at times. VFR conditions continue through
the TAF period with cloud cover giving way late morning to mostly
clear skies through the evening. Winds NE becoming N later this
morning and increasing to 8 to 12 kt. Winds decrease this evening
and turn back to the NE.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Winds will continue to subside across the region this
morning as a surface ridge begins to build offshore. Breezy winds
persist through the Central and East Strait of Juan de Fuca with
occasional gusts up to 25 kt between Race Rocks and Whidbey
Island, but this will continue to ease through the morning. Winds
will increase a bit tonight along the coastal waters south of
Point Grenville as the surface ridge continues to nose into the
region, contrasting with a surface trough over northern California
into Oregon, which will warrant a short-fused Small Craft Advisory
late this afternoon into early tonight.

High pressure will ease Thursday as a frontal system approaches the
coastal waters on Friday into Saturday. Onshore flow will continue
with several pushes down the Strait of Juan de Fuca during the
evening on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, each of which may warrant
additional Small Craft Advisories for these time periods.
Uncertainty exists about the forecast into early next week, but the
active pattern may continue.

Combined seas continue to hover at 10 to 11 ft this morning, so
have extended the small craft through late morning across the
coastal zones. Seas will continue to subside towards 5 to 7 ft
through the day and remain in that range through the rest of the
week and into the weekend.
