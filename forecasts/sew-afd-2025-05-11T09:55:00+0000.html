Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
255 AM PDT Sun May 11 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An organized frontal system will cross over western
Washington resulting in widespread showers today. Lingering moisture
with the parent upper low will keep showers in the forecast for
Monday, but they will be more scattered in coverage. Upper level
ridging will start to build into the area midweek for the return of
warm and dry conditions. Active weather is possible for late in the
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Latest satellite imagery
showing clouds over much of W WA...although the majority of them are
mid to high level, so some peeks of sky likely out there. At the
time of this writing, radar is pretty quiet, but starting to see the
first echoes associated with frontal system in the outer coastal
waters, suggesting inherited forecast is right on track.

All in all, models remain consistent with the forecast for the most
part, so no real deviation from what has been advertised. The best
chances for precip with the front likely to reach the coast by mid-
morning, then gradually seeping eastward, likely reaching the Sound
by late afternoon. The main difference in model output this morning
as opposed to prior forecasts has been the return of thunder
prospects. Not entirely sure what the NBM is keying in on here, as
model outputs for lift and instability are far from impressive.
Increasing clouds during the morning hours with temps expected to be
cooler today because of that will only contribute more CIN, making a
stronger case for consistency as opposed to biting onto this new
solution. Still...like a good neighbor, will allow for the prospect
of some spillover from PQRs CWA over far southern portions of our
coast and inward into parts of the SW interior. It makes sense they
will likely see the best instability, given the track of the upper
low, so have matched up accordingly.

As this upper low slowly creeps further eastward to our south, a
combo of lingering and wrap around moisture will keep showers in the
forecast for Monday, but PoPs for most lowland locations continue to
favor scattered coverage at best. Higher elevations, however look to
have better chances, particularly in the Cascades.

Upper level ridging still progged to enter into the area late Monday
night/early Tuesday and be the primary influence on the weather over
W WA. Models still remain pretty unimpressed with the ability of
this feature to clear out lingering moisture, however ensembles
remain largely in agreement that Tuesday will be dry. As such, this
moisture will likely take the form of clouds overhead, limiting the
blue skies available during the day.

Forecast remains consistent regarding daytime highs in the near term
as they will remain fairly static, generally ranging in the lower to
mid 60s inland, mid 50s to around 60 for water adjacent locations.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Upper level ridging
remains in place for all of Wednesday and spilling over into at
least Thursday morning. Deterministic model consensus breaks apart
Thursday afternoon, however, with the ECMWF being more aggressive
bringing in the next system while the GFS largely holds off on any
precip until late Friday. Ensemble mean seems to be really splitting
the difference, suggesting some rain may occur late Thursday, but
amounts would be paltry...begging the question if it would be worth
inclusion in the forecast. ECMWF maintains a general troughiness for
the remainder of the forecast, which would suggest showery weather
while the GFS shows a pretty organized front late Friday, but mainly
through the day Saturday. It comes as no surprise that the NBM leans
toward the ECMWF regarding when the prospect for precip begins, but
also keeps PoPs low...only ratcheting them up to coincide with the
frontal timing of the GFS, but still keeping PoPs less than 50 pct
to display inherent uncertainty. This all seems reasonable for now.

Temps in the long term will echo those of the short term, with no
real variation from the ranges provided there.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The air mass is moist and slightly unstable over
western WA today with an upper level low over the region. Showers
will increase this afternoon and evening with a slight chance of
thunderstorms south of KOLM. Cigs today mainly around 3000-6000 ft
with southerly surface flow to 10 kt. 33

KSEA...Showers increasing by 19-21z today with ceilings around 3000-
5000 ft. S wind to 10 kt. Showers decreasing after 06z this evening.
33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A 1000 mb surface low will track south over the offshore
waters today, along 130 west. This low will weaken and shift east
into Oregon on Monday, with onshore flow increasing Monday night.
Small Craft Advisory winds are likely through the Strait of Juan de
Fuca. High pressure sets up offshore with lower pressure inland on
Tuesday, with seas building to around 10 ft over the outer Coastal
Waters. This pattern will remain intact through Thursday with the
next frontal system moving inland on Friday. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
