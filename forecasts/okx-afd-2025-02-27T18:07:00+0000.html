Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
107 PM EST Thu Feb 27 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front pushes through this evening, followed by high
pressure building in overnight, lingering into tomorrow. Low
pressure passes to our north Saturday sending another warm front
our way Friday night followed by another cold front midday into
afternoon Saturday. High pressure builds in from the west for
the rest of the weekend into early next week. The high pressure
moves offshore towards the middle of next week, followed by an
approaching strong frontal system thereafter.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Additional shower chances with the cdfnt this aftn and eve,
although instability is lacking. Increased pops to categorical
across wrn Orange County.

Overall, expecting less than a tenth of an inch of QPF through
the evening for southern areas, such as Long Island. Areas in
the interior should still see amounts above 0.10" but likely no
more than 0.25".

SW winds before the cold front arrives with occasional gusts
around 20 kt possible, mainly along the coast.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH SATURDAY/...
Clouds clear and things dry out early tonight as the cold front
exits east and high pressure begins to settle in. Lows will be in
the mid/upper-30s tonight with some slight cold air advection from
the west, but these temps are still above average.

W/WNW winds will pick up closer to daybreak on Friday as the
pressure gradient from the low departing over the Canadian Maritimes
increases. Winds eventually relax as high pressure becomes more
centered over the area Friday afternoon, weakening the pressure
gradient. Highs on Friday will be a little cooler than previous days
in the 40s.

Heights drop Friday night into Saturday as a longwave trough
approaches from the west. An Alberta Clipper Low located over the
Great Lakes Friday night eventually passes to our east and northeast
on Saturday. This low brings another warm front through Friday night
and a cold front Saturday, sometime around the midday timeframe,
based on the latest model guidance.

Forcing looks best with warm air advection and positive vorticity
advection Friday night for precipitation. Better chances for
precipitation are in the interior with only slight chances towards
the southern part of the area, given the distance from the low and
the best forcing. Its possible we see a rain-snow mix in the
interior Friday night before temps warm, but most should see just
rain.

The cold front, which looks to arrive midday Saturday, has much
lower chances for precipitation given that model guidance has dry
air filtering in before the cold front`s arrival. Saturday may stay
dry for most, with only slight chances for rain in the interior.

Temperatures cool Saturday afternoon and evening following the
passage of the cold front as a longwave trough aloft settles over
the northeast with drying air.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
Key Points

* Significant temperature decrease Saturday night with lows by
  Sunday morning in the teens to mid 20s.

* Below normal highs Sunday and Monday staying in the 30s on average.

* Temperatures trending warmer for midweek, returning to above
  normal.

* Heavy rain possibility for midweek system next week.

Mid level trough remains over the region for the rest of the
weekend. The trough moves east of the region Monday. Ridging takes
over through midweek and then goes offshore. Deep trough
approaches Wednesday into Wednesday night next week.

Dry conditions prevail for Saturday night through early next week
with high pressure gaining more control. Strengthening frontal
system approaches for midweek as high pressure moves farther
offshore.

Precipitation chances return to the forecast for Tuesday night
through Wednesday night. This will be all in form of rain.

POPs are already pretty high with this event, a strong incoming
frontal system. Lots of meridional southerly flow ahead of it, so
rain showers could be heavy at times. Still too early for exact
timing and rainfall amounts. However, LREF model precipitable
water increases to near 1 inch with GFS showing values a little
above 1 inch for Wednesday next week.

.MARINE...
Increasing S flow ahead of an approaching cold front will bring SCA
conditions to the ocean waters today with gusts 25-30 kt and
and seas building to 7-10 ft. Elsewhere, expect marginal SCA
conditions across the eastern bays, eastern sound (east of the
CT River),and Great South Bay during the daytime hours. Winds
diminish in the evening, but seas will remain high.

Small craft conditions should carry though a good portion of Friday
with ocean seas ranging from 4 to 6 ft as any small craft gusts on
the ocean diminish by afternoon. A brief period of sub advisory
conditions is likely late Friday afternoon and evening before small
craft conditions return as a southerly flow increases into Saturday
morning. Small craft seas will be in place on the ocean Saturday
with marginal small craft gusts likely on a portion of the non-ocean
waters.

Long term, Saturday night through Monday night, non-ocean zones
below SCA. Ocean SCA conditions probable Saturday night into Sunday.
Sunday night through Monday night, sub-SCA conditions forecast for
all waters.
