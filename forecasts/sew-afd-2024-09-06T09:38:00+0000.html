Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
238 AM PDT Fri Sep 6 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Hot and dry conditions will continue across western
Washington today, with a Heat Advisory in effect for much of the
region. Temperatures will moderate over the weekend as a low
pressure system moves across the Pacific Northwest. Cooler and
wetter conditions are on track to return next week as a series of
troughs cross the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Temperatures remain elevated
this morning under the influence of a thermal trough, with a
handful of sites around the Puget Sound set to break daily
minimum temperature records. Most areas will stay above the 60
degree mark this morning as light easterly winds continue,
providing little relief to the hot daytime temperatures yesterday.

Moderate (orange) HeatRisk will continue today across western
Washington with temperatures peaking once again in the 80s and
90s. Areas along the Pacific Coast will likely experience the
hottest temperatures of the day around mid-day today before winds
shift onshore. Temperatures will slowly moderate as the thermal
trough pivots eastward, with most inland areas seeing high
temperatures similar to that of yesterday. While coastal areas
will see lows falling below the 60 degree mark into Saturday
morning, areas south and east of the Puget Sound will see elevated
overnight temperatures continue.

A low pressure system will strengthen and move towards the Pacific
Northwest Coast into Saturday, helping to break down the upper
level high pressure ridge. Increased onshore flow paired with an
influx of mid level moisture and wildfire smoke aloft will allow
temperatures to cool several degrees on Saturday, with highs
peaking in the 70s and 80s. Cloud cover will continue to increase
into Sunday as the trough axis swings across western Washington,
allowing temperatures to decrease even more. High temperatures
will return to the mid to upper 70s for most of the lowlands,
apart from the Cascade foothills where pockets of 80 degrees may
linger.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...A cooling trend will
continue throughout next week as long-range ensembles favor a
series of troughs to pass over the region. Models remain in good
agreement over the chance for light showers through much of next
week alongside cloudy skies and a shift to below-normal
temperatures. Nearly all locations across western Washington are
on track to see temperatures peak below 70 degrees next
Wednesday, with low temperatures staying steady through the week
in the low to mid 50s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge over Western Washington with south
southwesterly flow aloft. In the lower levels offshore flow will
continue throughout the morning before gradually weakening this
afternoon and evening. Onshore flow returning as early as this
afternoon for terminals along the coast while interior locations
will likely need to wait until very late tonight/early Saturday
morning.

VFR under clear skies for most terminals with some smoke aloft due
to regional wildfires. There are some isolated patches of MVFR to
IFR conditions, but nothing widespread nor impacting any of the TAF
sites. IFR/LIFR stratus expected to up the coastline Friday evening.

KSEA...Clear skies with smoke aloft. Light and variable winds
overnight becoming northerly 4 to 8 knots by 18Z and remaining that
way for the rest of the TAF period.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Thermally induced surface trough along the coast this
morning will slowly shift inland throughout the afternoon.
Increasing onshore flow tonight into Saturday. Low level onshore
flow pattern continuing into the first part of next week.

Possible small craft advisory westerlies evening and late night
hours over the weekend for the Central and Eastern Strait of Juan
de Fuca.

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper-ridging and an associated surface thermal
trough will continue critical fire weather conditions. Hot, dry,
and unstable conditions will remain through this afternoon for
the Olympic zones 652/661 and Cascade zones 658/659. A return to
onshore flow on Friday night into Saturday over the Olympic
Peninsula will begin to bring cooler, moist air to the Olympics
while the Cascades could remain warm, dry and unstable unless
increasing high cloud coverage and wildfire smoke limits the
risk. Something we`ll continue to monitor. Red Flag Warnings over
the mountain zones remain in place for today due to continued
hot, dry and unstable conditions.

Cooler and more moist air will return area-wide through the weekend
with the potential of some wetting rains by mid-week.
