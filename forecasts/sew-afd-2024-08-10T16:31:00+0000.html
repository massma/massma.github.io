Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
931 AM PDT Sat Aug 10 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Warmer conditions will linger today for the interior
with cooler conditions along the coast. Afternoon and evening
thunderstorms over the Cascades with areas of lofted smoke and
haze will continue as well. Onshore flow will bring much cooler
conditions Sunday into next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows the
stratus has made it into the majority of Puget Sound this morning.
Overall, the forecast trends remain on track for today and have
only made minor tweaks to account for the extent of the current
cloud cover. Expect stratus to scatter across the interior between
18-20Z and retreat back to the coast. The previous discussion
follows below, with updates made to the marine, aviation, and fire
sections. 14

There`s another threat of showers and isolated thunderstorms in
the Cascades today (near the crest) with upper level troughing
over the Pac NW. Winds aloft are westerly and we should see less
smoke/haze over western WA from nearby wildfires. Temperatures
will be in the 70s to lower 80s. Heat Risk will be mostly Minor
with a few pockets of Moderate in the interior. The coast will be
cooler and in the 60s with NW winds.

A second. deeper, trough will be over the region on Sunday and
Monday for cloudier and cooler conditions. Max temps on both days
will only be in the 60s to lower/mid 70s (interior). There`s an
additional threat of showers and isolated thunderstorms once again
near the Cascade crest. 33

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Moving through the week
ahead, the air mass will remain cool as an upper low drops down
from Canada. Temperatures will remain mostly in the 60s and 70s or
a few degrees cooler than average. Isolated showers will be
mostly tied to the Cascades. A few ensemble members are showing
potential for warmer temps (80s again) by the weekend with
deeper, southerly flow over the area. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest flow aloft with upper level troughing over
western Washington. Marine stratus is in place through much of the
interior except through the north, including KBLI. Ceilings under
the stratus are primarily IFR to LIFR, as well as some visibility
restrictions with mist and fog. Stratus should begin to retreat this
morning, allowing the interior to clear out by 18-20Z with a return
to VFR conditions. The coast, however, does not look to clear out
today and will remain under low ceilings through the TAF period.
Another widespread push of marine stratus is likely to redevelop
overnight into Sunday morning. Light winds this morning will pick up
to west/southwesterly by this afternoon and evening.

KSEA...LIFR ceilings this morning with low marine stratus. Not
expecting much lift in the ceilings before they burn away at around
18-19Z this morning, bringing a return to VFR conditions for the
remainder of the day and early tonight. However, an additional round
of marine stratus is in the cards to arrive overnight into Sunday
morning. Surface winds primarily out of the SW between 5-10 kt
throughout the TAF period.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>1032mb NE Pacific surface high is well offshore but is
maintaining onshore flow here across area waters. This evening`s
push of westerly winds down the Strait of Juan de Fuca has prompted
a Small Craft Advisory for the Central and East Strait through
tonight. Additionally, winds look to pick up through the northern
and central outer coastal waters. Winds will ease tonight but seas
will remain steep, reaching 6 to 9 ft with a period of 8 seconds
which will linger through tomorrow, prompting an SCA for the
aforementioned outer coastal waters. Seas will ease back to 3 to 5 ft
on Monday and remain like so through the week.

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper trough brushing the area to the north
will bring isolated thunderstorms and elevated fire weather
conditions to the Cascades today. Thunderstorm probabilities are
greatest across the North Cascades at 20-30%, though isolated
thunder will still be possible along the Central Cascades with
guidance indicating a 10-20% chance. Coverage across the western
slopes looks to be less than that of the previous days, however
any thunderstorms that do develop may produce frequent lightning,
brief heavy downpours, hail, and gusty and erratic winds. Despite
rainfall, lightning strikes will have the potential to create new
fire starts. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
