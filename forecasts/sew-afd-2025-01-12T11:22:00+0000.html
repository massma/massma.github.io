Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
322 AM PST Sun Jan 12 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A less active pattern is developing across Western
Washington for the start of this week. High pressure builds
aloft, maintaining cool and mostly dry conditions. Morning fog
will develop under the strengthening ridge, until a weak
disturbance arrives late Wednesday or Thursday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A few light showers
developed across western Whatcom County south through northern
Whidbey Island early this morning, but otherwise a rather dry
night across the region. Areas of fog and low stratus continue to
develop as the ridge of high pressure begins to shift over the
region. As the high pressure strengthens over the area, mostly dry
conditions will result. However, a few showers could develop near
the coast in the mountains with some weak lift and moisture in the
continued northwesterly flow as the ridge builds. Morning fog will
be the primary sensible weather impact for most though each of the
next few morning. This could bring rather widespread temperatures
near the freezing mark the next few mornings. This isn`t much of
a deviation from normal temperatures for this time of year, but
nevertheless reflects cooler conditions than we`ve seen for most
of the season thus far.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Expect some increased
cloud cover late Wednesday into Thursday as ensemble guidance
continues to support a brief shake-up in the pattern as the next
upper trough slides into south-central British Columbia. Still
some discrepancies in both the depth of this trough and exactly
what path it will take. Unsurprisingly, PoPs still hold around 20
percent, highest in the north, and the bigger sensible weather
impact for most will be the additional clouds and a bit more
mixing which should bring a brief reprieve from the fog and any
increasingly stagnant air. For the remainder of the week, the
spread in potential scenarios becomes increasingly large owing
primarily to differences in the position and amplitude of the
Pacific ridge - specifically , is it close enough to block the
region from additional disturbances or far enough offshore to
leave the door open. One thing to keep an eye on with future
cycles of guidance in the potential for even colder air to arrive
around next weekend, with the forecast trending a bit cooler late
next weekend. Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
