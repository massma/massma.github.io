Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
340 PM PDT Thu Oct 31 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Unsettled weather will continue through the weekend as
an upper trough offshore slowly progresses across the Pacific
Northwest. Another frontal system is expected Monday into early
Tuesday for additional precipitation. Some ridging may bring drier
weather during the middle of next week.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Latest radar imagery shows
mass of showers talked about in morning discussion having a very
difficult moving eastward, remaining largely along the coast and the
southern half of the Olympic Peninsula. Seeing a handful of weak
echoes on the east side of the Sound...but these really are not
amounting to anything of consequence. Satellite imagery again, not a
whole lot different from the morning discussion where nearly solid
cloud deck in place over the western half of the CWA whereas there
are some break in the clouds over the eastern half. Again, any
breaks should start to fill in as precip very gradually moves
eastward.

In the broad sense, forecast is largely unchanged. An upper level
low off the BC coast continues to churn moisture into the area as it
very slowly moves eastward. This will be the main weather feature
throughout the remainder of today and at least into Friday night or
early Saturday morning. Even though this feature shifts east of the
area by Saturday afternoon, lingering moisture as well as the next
incoming system will keep PoPs in place throughout the day Saturday
and into at least Sunday morning. Ensembles suggest there may be a
very brief dry period Sunday afternoon...but that appears to be best
measured in only a handful of hours and likely not a stretch to be
planned on.

Regarding inherited Winter Weather headlines, latest models nudged
QPF values up some and this has given rise to potential concerns for
mountain snow concerns for the central Cascades. At this time, it
does look like some locations above 4000 ft may meet Advisory
criteria for snowfall totals into Friday night. As such, will likely
include that area into inherited headlines, echoing what is already
out for the south Cascades. This QPF nudge has also upped snowfall
amounts in the North Cascades and the concern here is that some
spots may see Winter Storm criteria. At this time, however, these
spots do not seem to be terribly widespread and as such have
hesitated on upgrading the headline there. Collab with surrounding
offices boosted confidence to a degree...so will likely pass word to
next forecast shift that an upgrade should be considered.

Lowland temps throughout the near term will remain fairly static,
with highs generally in the lower 50s and overnight lows in the
lower to mid 40s.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Another frontal system
expected to move into W WA by late Monday morning and although this
system does appear to weaken as it traverses the CWA, limiting the
amount of precip, there is good agreement among both deterministic
and ensemble members to keep PoPs in the likely to categorical
ranges. Lingering moisture behind the front may be enough to keep
some showers in the forecast for Tuesday, however PoPs at this point
take a hit, peaking within chance wording. Upper level ridging sets
up over the area Wednesday and lingers into Thursday, finally
allowing for a dry period during the mid-week time frame.

Lowland temps at the start of the long term will not differ too much
from the short term, however the ridge will bring at least a little
warming to the area Wednesday and Thursday, as daytime highs get
into the mid to upper 50s...but the trade off may be cooler
overnight lows, with temps ranging in the upper 30s to lower 40s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft continues over W WA as a
upper level low continues to spin over British Columbia. VFR
conditions this afternoon over most of the area except KHQM where
incoming showers are lowering conditions to MVFR. Conditions over
the interior will start to lower to MVFR this evening around 05z-09z
and will likely continue through Friday morning. In locations under
localized heavier showers, may see brief periods of IFR conditions.
S/SE winds will increase over mainly the northern portions of our
area this evening, mainly affecting KPAE and KBLI, with speeds
around 10 to 15 kts.

KSEA...VFR this afternoon will be short lived as incoming showers
will gradually lower ceilings down to MVFR this evening around 06z-
09z. Rain will become more widespread by Friday morning, likely
keeping MVFR conditions in place. If a shower passes directly over
the terminal, could likely see brief periods of IFR as well. S/SE
winds 4 to 8 knots this afternoon will increase to around 8 to 12
knots tonight into early Friday morning (07z-11z).<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface low will continue to gradually fill in and
remain west of Vancouver Island this evening. Elevated seas still
continue over the coastal waters with recent buoy observations over
the coastal waters generally around 12 to 14 feet. A small craft
advisory will continue over the coastal waters due to these elevated
seas. Winds will increase over the Eastern Entrance of the Strait of
Juan De Fuca later later this afternoon, where a Small Craft
Advisory will remain. Latest guidance suggests some brief gusts
approaching gale force this evening in the Eastern Entrance, but
will be short lived.

Another surface low looks to spin over the offshore waters on Friday
which will track through the inland waters on Friday, where winds
may get up to Small Craft Advisory criteria later Friday evening.

As above, combined seas will be around 12 to 14 feet this evening
and will gradually decrease into Friday, but will remain above 10
feet. Seas look to increase once again late Sunday into Monday, with
waves potentially building upwards to around 15 to 18 feet.
