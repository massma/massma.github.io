Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
824 AM PDT Tue May 13 2025

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Very light rain observed over the last 6 hours, mainly
east of the I-5 corridor, with amounts up to 0.05" for the
lowlands, and near 0.10" for the Cascades. This light shower
activity was associated with a broad upper trough that
continues to advance eastward. A few showers may linger over
the Cascades and eastern Olympics this afternoon, otherwise,
generally dry weather for most areas. Temperatures will
generally range in the upper 50s to mid 60s for highs. No major
forecast updates, other than to introduce slight POPs east of
I-5 corridor King CO southwards this morning. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A broad upper level trough will gradually advance
eastward, with drier conditions for areas other than the
mountains by Tuesday afternoon. Another disturbance will bring
additional shower chances Wednesday, and several additional
systems arriving later in the week through next weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>As of early this morning, mostly dry conditions with only a few
isolated showers mostly confined near the Cascades. As the main
upper low shifts eastward today, expect that any showers will
be limited to a few scattered over the higher terrain.
Otherwise, areas of low stratus again developing along the coast
and into portions of the interior, which will likely remain
into the mid-morning hours before gradual improvement occurs
this afternoon.

Overall, not much change in the pattern into Wednesday, though
coverage may increase a bit as an embedded shortwave clips the
northern portion of the area. High temperatures will remain in
the lower to mid 60s for the interior, with mid to upper 50s for
the coast and water adjacent locations. A deeper disturbance
arrives again around Thursday, ushering in a more widespread
chance of rain showers across the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Generally decent agreement in the ensemble guidance for the end
of the week with another broad upper trough bringing additional
rain to the region this weekend. While QPF remains on the lower
side, a generally cool and showery pattern will be the most
likely result for the region into the start of next week.
Temperatures hold fairly consistent through the long term,
generally holding in the lower to mid 60s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>North to northwesterly flow aloft over W WA today before
turning more northwesterly early Wednesday. Winds at the surface are
southwest in most areas at 4 to 8 kt. A push through the Strait of
Juan de Fuca this afternoon may turn the winds northwesterly later
in the afternoon/evening with some diffluence (but should stay north
of Seattle). Will weaken tonight and become more southwesterly into
Wednesday (with strongest winds in the South Interior, and coastal
areas along the Pacific and the strait).

Satellite has pockets of MVFR dropping southward along the I-5
corridor this morning with an associated area of showers, as well as
the coast (most terminals reporting ceilings as low as 1,000 to
2,000 feet). Couple isolated pockets of IFR/LIFR continue in the
Cascades and offshore the coastline. Once the showers pass through,
conditions will improve to VFR with clouds remaining through the
afternoon (best chance of some clearing will be from KPAE northward
for a few hours this evening. MVFR will remain along the coast
through today, and a cold front tonight will bring a few isolated
showers (primarily north of I-90), and widespread MVFR ceilings
Wednesday morning.

KSEA...Small corridor of showers tracking through the terminal this
morning. This has brought CIGs down to MVFR this morning. Once the
showers move through, CIGs are expected to lift up to VFR (remaining
BKN/OVC) between 18-21Z. Winds are expected to remain out of the
southwest 4 to 8 kt at the terminal (but possible that winds to the
north may flip northwesterly later this afternoon and evening). CIGs
expected to dip back to MVFR later tonight into Wednesday morning.

.MARINE...
High pressure over the coastal waters with lower pressure
inland will remain intact through Wednesday night, allowing for
westerly pushes down the Strait both this afternoon and Wednesday
afternoon. Forecast has SCA winds for both time frames and as such,
will issue a new SCA to cover this afternoon through overnight. A
follow up headline for Wednesday may be needed, but will leave for
future shifts to determine. Frontal system moving through the waters
later Thursday into Thursday night. High pressure will build over
the coastal waters for the weekend.

Northwest winds 15 to 25 mph with seas 10 to 12 feet over the outer
Coastal Waters today...and enough of a spill-over when it comes to
seas may impact portions of the inner coastal waters. As such, felt
expansion of the inherited SCA there was warranted. Both the winds
and seas will subside tonight with no headline criteria expected
afterward for the remainder of the week. 18
