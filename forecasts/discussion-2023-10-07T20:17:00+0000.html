Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
417 PM EDT Sat Oct 7 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front will pass to the east this evening. Low pressure will
deepen across eastern Canada tonight into Sunday, then remaining
nearly stationary and weakening through mid week. A frontal
system may impact the area at the end of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SUNDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Jet dynamics associated with a negatively tilted upper trough
have lifted north, sending cold front across the area late this
afternoon into early this evening. The area of showers along and
ahead of the front continues diminish in intensity and is no
longer a flood threat. The brunt of the rain early this evening
will be across eastern LI/southern CT before the front exits to
the east. Any post-frontal showers look to be scattered
elsewhere.

A gusty W/NW flow immediately behind the front will produce
gusts up to 30 kt for an hour or two, before diminishing to 15
to 20 kt. It will also turn much cooler through the night with
lows generally in the 40s to around 50. This will be about 10-15
degrees cooler than last night. It will also clear from west to
east this evening into the early morning hours.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The closed upper low will lift up into eastern Canada Sunday
with deepening surface low pressure becoming occluded. This low
will then become stationary and weaken through the first half
of the upcoming week. This will result in a brisk W flow and
below normal temperatures. Highs Sunday and Monday will be in
the upper 50s to lower 60s, with lows Sunday night in the 40s in
outlying areas to around 50 across the NYC metro.

In addition, with cyclonic flow there should be instability cu
each afternoon. Have even included a slight chance of showers
Sunday afternoon across Orange County NY. The HRRR has bit more
coverage to the east of this area, but confidence is too low at
this time to add elsewhere. In addition, shortwave energy
rounding the base of the upper low could produce a few showers
Sunday night. For the time, have kept these east of the area.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The upper low over eastern Canada gradually fills and weakens
through the end of the week. This will allow for a slow warmup
with a low chance of showers Monday night into Tuesday as
additional shortwave energy rounds the base of the upper low.

Warmer and more humid conditions develop late in the week with
an approaching frontal system. Rain chances increase during
this time. The heaviest rain at this time looks to hold off
until late Friday or Saturday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /20Z SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front has moved east of city terminals, and is expected
to move east of Long Island and southeast CT later this
evening. Low pressure will then meander over New England and
southeast Canada into early next week.

The cold front will continue to bring a round of showers to KISP,
KBDR and eventually KGON, with city terminals currently experiencing
lighter rounds of lingering post-frontal showers. All showers should
clear NYC terminals by 00Z, with the timing just a few hours later
for eastern terminals.

Cloud ceilings are also expected to rise behind the front with many
city terminals now at MVFR, later this evening and tonight returning
to VFR as clouds rise and clear out.

WInds at city terminals are now NW at 10-15 kts with frequent gusts
20-25 kts. Winds and gusts may weaken a bit late tonight into early
Sunday morning before increasing after day break.

VFR and westerly winds are expected Sunday with gusts at or below
20 kts for most terminals.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Amendments likely due to changing flight categories.

Timing of improvement to VFR may be off by 1-3 hours.

Timing of cold front passage/NW wind shift may be off by 1-2 hours.

OUTLOOK FOR 21Z SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...

Sunday Afternoon: VFR. W winds around 15G20-25kt.

Monday: Mainly VFR. Low chance of showers at night. SW G15-20kt

Tuesday...Manly VFR. Low chance of showers. S-SW G15-20kt.

Wednesday and Thursday...VFR.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Gusty W winds will bring SCA to all waters this evening and
through the day on Sunday. For the ocean, seas will likely
remain above 5 ft Sunday night with gradually diminishing winds.

Seas on the ocean are progged to be in the 3-5 ft range Mon-
Tue, then less on Wed. Seas then build again on Thu ahead of a
strong frontal sys. Otherwise, winds are progged to remain blw
SCA lvls Mon-Thu attm.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...

<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No hydrologic impacts expected Sun-Fri.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Long period SE swells from the remnant low of Phillipe will
build to 6 to 9 ft tonight, presenting the likelihood of
additional beach erosion/escarpment from an east to west sweep
of 5 to 7 ft breaking surf. Because water levels are not
astronomically high, the dune erosion threat during times of
high tide is isolated. Swells subside Sunday into Sunday night.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
