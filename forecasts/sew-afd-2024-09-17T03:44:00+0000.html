Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
844 PM PDT Mon Sep 16 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Weak ridging over the area today for general benign
conditions. A upper level trough and associated front will push
through the region late Tuesday for some rain showers into
Wednesday. Drier conditions into Thursday before unsettled weather
likely returns to the area through the weekend.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Stilt imagery shoes high
cirrus clouds moving across western Washington, as well as some
low clouds and fog beginning to develop along the Pacific Coast
and some of the mountain valleys. More high clouds look to filter
in early tomorrow morning ahead of an incoming system. The marine
stratus also gradually push inland tonight, as well as some patchy
fog in the mountain valleys and foothills. Look for breaks in the
clouds early tonight to potentially catch a glimpse at the aurora
tonight.

An upper level trough and associated front will start to approach
the coastal areas by Tuesday morning and will start to spread rain
showers inland by the afternoon. Latest ensembles show a strong
jet jet digging southward which could slow down and weaken the
front as it approaches western Washington. Regardless, there will
be plenty of cloud cover around with light rain showers across
the area. Low temperatures Tuesday night will hover in the 50s.

The front will dissipate over the area into Wednesday with
lingering showers, as weak northerly flow will keep our region
somewhat dry into Thursday. High temperatures will continue to
remain in the low to mid 60s.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Confidence in the long term
continues to wobble as ensembles attempt to agree on a solution.
Latest guidance indicates a weak disturbance passing through the
area on Friday which would keep showers in the forecast. The GFS
continues to highlight an upper level ridge into the weekend,
meanwhile the ECMWF highlights multiple systems with plentiful
moisture into the beginning of next week. The latest trends have
been pushing more towards the more wet solution, of multiple
systems transversing across the Pacific Northwest, which could
really open up the door to fall. Will keep chance of showers in
the forecast for now and will see how the models evolve.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light northerly flow aloft will increase westerly
tonight as an upper trough and associated frontal system moves
towards the area. Generally VFR cigs this evening with high clouds.
Areas of low stratus are developing along the immediate coast this
evening. Generally IFR/LIFR stratus will spread inland along the
immediate coast tonight, with MVFR/IFR cigs for the interior by
early Tuesday morning (reaching most interior areas between 11-14z).
MVFR/IFR cigs are expected Tuesday morning with cigs lifting towards
high-end MVFR and potentially low-end VFR Tuesday afternoon, with
continued low cigs for the coast. Light rain will also be likely,
mainly along the Olympic Peninsula on Tuesday. Light winds tonight
will increase S/SW on Tuesday.

KSEA...VFR conditions with high clouds this evening. Stratus will
spread into Puget Sound, including the terminal, early Tuesday
morning (generally between 12-14z). MVFR cigs are expected into
Tuesday afternoon, with approximately a 30% of IFR cigs between 14-
18z. Light winds will increase S/SW Tuesday morning. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...A broad surface ridge remains centered well offshore with
lower pressure over the interior. Onshore flow will increase
somewhat this evening. Strongest winds expected in the central/east
strait tonight, with high resolution ensembles continuing to show
only a 15-20% chance of reaching small craft criteria. The surface
ridge over the offshore waters will weaken tonight and a trough and
associated front will shift into the coastal waters on Tuesday. This
system is unlikely to generate any headlines. The trough will weaken
as it gradually shifts southward into the Oregon coastal waters on
Wednesday. High pressure rebuilds offshore late in the week before
another front is expected over the upcoming weekend.
