Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
811 PM EDT Tue Jul 25 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will remain offshore this week. An upper level
disturbance moved east of the area tonight, followed by another
disturbance on Thursday, as a hot and humid airmass builds into
the region through Saturday. A cold front passes through the
region Saturday into Saturday night. Canadian high pressure will
build in Sunday and Monday, and move off shore Tuesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The line of showers and thunderstorms has weakened and at
00Z Wednesday was about to move out of the region. Isolated
severe thunderstorms did occur with this line, along with strong
gusty winds. See summary local storm report (LSROKX) and a
public information statement (PNSOKX) for details on the storms
that moved through the region.

Updated for the progression of the line, and temperatures and
dew points that quickly fell as the storms moved through the
area. Skies will be clearing behind the upper disturbance
overnight. Lows will be in the lower 60s to lower 70s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
As the aforementioned shortwave trough exits the area to the east,
the flow aloft becomes zonal through Wednesday. High pressure at the
surface remains offshore and will continue to aid in a moist S/SW
flow. Dry conditions are expected with broad subsidence throughout
the profile. High temperatures will be in the mid 80s to low 90s,
with plenty of sunshine.

The zonal flow will be short-lived as the next shortwave approaches
Wednesday night. Clouds will increase and lows are expected to be
several degrees warmer, in the upper 60s to mid 70s.

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A hot and humid airmass builds into the region for Thursday and
remains into Saturday. A shortwave and surface low will be
tracking north of the region Thursday and have lowered
probabilities during the afternoon. With higher confidence of
reaching heat advisory criteria across much of the region, have
issued a heat advisory for all but southern New London county,
and the south fork of Long Island. There are a few locations
that may briefly reach heat indices near 105. Friday remains the
warmest and most humid day, and heat indices across much of the
region are expected to reach at least 105, and with the
possibility of reaching excessive heat warning criteria held off
on extending the advisory into Friday. The Weather Prediction
Center continues to show a 10-40% chance of heat index values
exceeding 110 on Friday.

A cold front will be approaching Saturday and while dew points
will remain in the 70s temperatures are a little more uncertain
with cloud cover and the chance of precipitation. However,
several locations may once again reach heat advisory criteria.

Once the cold front passes through the region Saturday night
and cooler and drier Canadian airmass moves into the area.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Updated the weather as a line of showers and thunderstorms has
moved through the waters and weakened.

A Marine Weather Statement continues for Long Island Sound. The
US Coast Guard still indicates a large debris field caused by
recent flooding across New England.

Sub-SCA criteria is expected tonight through Wednesday night.
However, damaging winds and large hail are possible in any
thunderstorms this afternoon and evening.

A persistent southwest flow increases Thursday with gusts reaching
SCA levels on the ocean waters, and possibly into the the Long
Island south shore bays. There is also a chance that gusts reach
near 25 kt across eastern Long Island Sound and the Long Island
eastern bays. Ocean seas will also build to SCA levels during
Thursday. Conditions slowly improve Thursday night into early Friday
as a surface trough weakens across the ocean waters. Ocean seas may
build back to 5 feet Friday night into Saturday ahead of a cold
front, and then fall below Saturday night with the passage of the
front, as winds become northwest.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
