.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system will continue to push inland this
afternoon into tonight. High pressure will build Wednesday night
into Thursday, bringing drier conditions. Wet and unsettled
conditions return early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Radar imagery shows lowland rain
and mountain snow continuing to push through Western Washington.
Precipitation will gradually taper off later this afternoon as the
front pushes inland. Post-frontal showers remain possible tonight.
A chance of thunderstorms (20-30%) remains possible this afternoon
into tonight along the coast. Expecting an additional 1-4 inches
of snow along the mountain passes by Wednesday morning, and
0.05-0.5 inches of rain (higher amounts along the coast and lower
amounts in the lowlands). Breezy winds will persist this
afternoon and gradually subside tonight.

Isolated showers are possible Wednesday as a low pressure system
begins to slide south off the coast of British Columbia. The bulk
of the precipitation with this system will be centered around
Oregon and California. As for Western Washington, the highest PoPs
remain along the coast and mountains. Accumulations will be
light. Cloud cover will gradually decrease throughout the day on
Wednesday. Mostly clear skies late Wednesday night into Thursday
morning, may lead to patchy fog along the southwest interior.

A drier airmass will settle over the Pacific Northwest late
Wednesday night into Thursday as upper level ridging continues to
build offshore. Expect clear sunny skies on Thursday. The upper
level ridge will move inland on Friday, with a frontal system
tailing right behind it. However, with the ridge well situated
over Western Washington, it will keep the bulk of the
precipitation to the north in British Columbia.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The aforementioned ridge
still remains in place over the Pacific Northwest, keeping the
region mostly dry. Some models do indicate at some PoPs possibly
returning on Saturday; however they remain concentrated along the
north coast and northern Cascades. The bulk of the precipitation
still remains concentrated in British Columbia.

High pressure will weaken on Sunday. Wet and unsettled conditions
expected into early next week. However, this is where
deterministic models start having trouble resolving the next
weather pattern. One solution favors a potential atmospheric river
impacting the Pacific Northwest early next week. Another solution
favors split flow and slightly drier conditions for Western
Washington. At this time, the latter solution seems more
favorable, as supported by cluster analysis, where the majority of
members signal for split flow to develop early next week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft with an fast-moving frontal system
spreading precipitation and lower ceilings across the region. Expect
lingering MVFR to local IFR conditions along the front in rain, but
gradual improvement to at least lower VFR ceilings in the post-
frontal air mass. Some showers will linger an an isolated
thunderstorm or two can`t be ruled out closer to the coast and
offshore. Otherwise, gusty southerly winds ahead of the front will
linger into the early evening before easing tonight. With residual
surface moisture and building high pressure, expect patches of fog
and low clouds developing overnight Tuesday into Wednesday morning.
This is especially true in the more sheltered, fog-prone
locations.

KSEA...Expect MVFR ceilings and rain through around 01z as main
frontal line pushes through, with additional post-frontal showers
into the evening. Ceilings this evening expected to return to VFR at
around 4000 ft, but another lowering possible overnight 09-14z as
the air mass stabilizes but remains moist. Gusty southerly winds
this afternoon with gusts around 20 kt for a few hours through
around 01-02z, but easing and becoming light southerly overnight. 12<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The front has pushed onshore and is lifting through the
waters of the Salish Sea this evening. Expect lingering gusty winds
to ease behind the front. Meanwhile, seas somewhat steep over the
coastal waters in response to the winds. Periods will lengthen but
seas will rise, reaching 8 to 12 feet over the coastal waters this
evening through early Wednesday (highest beyond about 20 nm from
shore). Seas will then hover around 10 ft through midweek. Weak high
pressure will rebuild offshore late Wednesday night into Thursday.
The next frontal system looks to approach on Friday, potentially
bringing another round of small craft winds into the weekend. Expect
seas over the coastal waters to again build to around 12 ft over the
weekend as a result. 12<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No river flooding through the weekend. Another round
of rain early next week could push the Skokomish River above
action stage. There has been a lot of variability in the rainfall
forecast. The threat for river flooding on other rivers appears
minimal at this time.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
