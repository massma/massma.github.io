Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
319 AM PDT Mon Aug 5 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure aloft to start the week with continued
above normal temperatures and dry weather. However, increased
onshore flow will bring near-normal conditions on Tuesday before
warming up shortly afterwards. Subtle disturbances may usher
marginal thunderstorm potential over the Cascades mainly during
the second half of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Four Corners ridge remains
in place as its axis is directly over the PNW. Upstream, a baggy
500 mb trough is positioned offshore as its center is just off
the WA/OR coast. Here locally, we`ve been under persistent
southwest flow aloft as the pattern has been rather stagnant so
of course, dry weather and slightly above-normal temperatures for
the interior is expected today. Thunderstorm activity has been
observed so far morning in N OR but SW flow aloft should steer it
clear of our area. Can`t rule out the Lewis County Cascades
getting clipped but confidence is leaning mostly dry. Marine
stratus is making a run inland as morning clouds start things off
but diurnal mixing will give way to mostly clear skies for most
during the afternoon. Highs today are to top into the low to mid
80s across the lowlands with Cascade valleys getting near 90 F.
Coastal areas will maintain in the 60s and 70s.

Cooler on Tuesday as onshore flow ramps up with help of the
upper-level pattern progressing. Marine air will bring average
temperatures and the typical morning low stratus. This trend will
last into Wednesday aside from temperatures maybe warming up by a
few degrees as onshore flow slightly weakens.


.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Deterministic guidance has
quasi-zonal flow of the area on Thursday. Will have to monitor
the continued threat for elevation convection during the second
half of the week. Around Friday, models are hinting at a shortwave
trough over the PNW and upper-ridging upstream over the NE Pac.
Ensemble guidance continues to favor above normal temperatures
through the rest of the forecast period.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft will continue across Western
Washington through today. Stratus is spreading into Puget Sound
early this morning, with generally LIFR/IFR cigs and some low-end
MVFR cigs along the coast. Stratus will continue to spread further
into central and southern Puget Sound through the morning, before
slowly clearing back to the coast generally late morning. VFR
expected for the afternoon with MVFR cigs along the coast this
afternoon. Generally W/SW winds through today.

KSEA...VFR clear skies early this morning. Stratus continue to
spread eastward into Puget Sound this morning, likely reaching KSEA
between 12-13z and clearing 16-18z, however, confidence remains
higher in stratus just W of the terminal. Generally IFR cigs
expected with stratus. Light S/SW winds this morning becoming more W
into this afternoon. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A persistent pattern will continue across the region
through early next week with broad high pressure offshore and lower
pressure inland. Diurnally driven westerly winds are expected
through the Strait of Juan de Fuca will continue, with Small Craft
Advisory winds expected Monday evening, and perhaps again Tuesday
evening as well. Onshore flow will weaken later Wednesday into late
week. Persistent northwest winds will continue over the outer
coastal waters. Steep conditions over the next few days for the
outer coastal waters with seas generally 5 to 6 feet. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
