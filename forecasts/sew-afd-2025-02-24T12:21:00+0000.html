Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
421 AM PST Mon Feb 24 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An atmospheric river pattern will maintain wet
conditions across western Washington into early this week, with
periods of moderate to heavy rain and strong winds. Conditions
are favored to dry out towards mid-week as high pressure develops,
with potential for more widespread light precipitation next
weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Lingering shower activity
will continue to stream northward early this morning as weak
ridging aloft allows conditions to briefly dry out. A deepening
low offshore will bring in the next round of impactful weather,
lifting a frontal system northward across western Washington today
that will generate strong winds and widespread precipitation
alongside high seas. While forecast models still show some
variability over the exact track of the low pressure center,
confidence is high that this system will produce strong winds
region-wide and periods of moderate to heavy precipitation. Winds
will be strongest along the Pacific Coast, where gusts up to 60
mph are possible early this afternoon through early Tuesday
morning before the low pressure center shifts onshore and weakens.
Ensembles show a high (60% to 70%) likelihood of wind gusts
reaching 50 mph later this evening into early Tuesday morning
across the lowlands south and east of the Puget Sound, including
the Seattle and Tacoma metro areas, with a slight chance (20% to
30% probabilities) of gusts reaching 60 mph. Winds will peak in
the late evening and early overnight hours before easing into
Tuesday. The long duration of these winds may exacerbate impacts,
especially along the coast where power outages are likely. The
convective nature of this storm system will also allow for locally
heavy showers to develop, producing heavy precipitation at times
and carrying enough instability for more lightning strikes today.
This system will bring an additional 1 to 3 inches of liquid for
most areas through Tuesday and up to 4 inches over higher
elevations of the Olympics and Cascades, which will cause
continued elevated river flows across western Washington. With
snow levels lowering to 3500-4000 ft, the mountains will see
significant accumulating snowfall over higher elevations. Higher
Cascade mountain passes, including Stevens and White Passes, will
see up to a foot or more of accumulating snowfall, with a storm
total on the order of 2 or 3 feet of snow on track for Paradise.
Snoqualmie Pass, on the other hand, is favored to see lesser snow
accumulations. Precipitation will taper off across the lowlands by
late Tuesday morning as the low weakens and shifts eastward, with
showers continuing through Tuesday night over higher terrain.

A sharp upper level ridge will develop over the region on
Wednesday, allowing conditions to dry out and advecting warmer
air into the region. Temperatures Wednesday will rebound into the
upper 50s and low 60s with some sun breaks.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Thursday will bring a
chance of light showers, mainly north of the Puget Sound, as a
frontal system splits as it shifts inland. Upper level ridging
will then rebound on Friday before breaking down on Saturday as
another storm system approaches. While forecast confidence
decreases heading into the weekend, the incoming precipitation is
expected to be light with no significant impacts.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A small break in precipitation as most of the rain has
dissipated early this morning.  A mix of VFR/MVFR conditions early
this morning. Satellite imagery shows that fog has started to form
across southern Puget Sound, which may allow for ceilings to lower
into IFR. However, confidence is low on fog formation north of
Olympia, as high clouds are beginning to push north. Two rounds of
rain are expected to push across the terminals today: one later this
morning and another one in the Monday night into Tuesday, which will
keep ceilings to trend MVFR.

Winds will increase Monday afternoon into Tuesday morning. Winds
will be 15-30 kt,gusting to 45-50 kt. The strongest winds will be
along the coastal terminals. Probabilities of seeing gusts greater
than 45 kt are 60-80% at KHQM, while elsewhere it is 30-50%. The
strongest winds will be Monday night into early Tuesday morning.
Easterly winds in the morning turning south throughout the day on
Monday.

KSEA...Ceilings currently trending VFR, with models hinting that it
will persist through the morning. This may allow fog formation to
form early this morning, however with the high cloud cover already
reaching the southern Sound, confidence is low on whether the fog
will fill in at KSEA. Conditions are expected to lower later this
morning and afternoon as rain returns, with ceilings trending MVFR
through the remainder of the TAF period.

Easterly winds in the morning gradually veering south through the
day. Winds are expected to increase Monday afternoon into Tuesday
morning, with speeds of 15-25 kt, gusting to 30 kt. The chances of
seeing gusts above 45 kt are 30-40%.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Unsettled marine conditions are expected to persist into
early Tuesday morning. Winds will increase later today as a strong
low pressure system pushes across the offshore waters. Winds will
increase to high-end Gale Force winds across the majority of the
waters (including the inland waters), with the exception of the
Central Strait of Juan de Fuca, where winds will stay within Small
Craft criteria. The strongest winds will be along the southern
coastal waters, where Storm Force gusts will be likely. Winds are
expected to peak Monday night into early Tuesday morning. Winds will
begin to subside throughout the day on Tuesday as high pressure
rebuilds over the waters. Calmer marine conditions expected to last
late into the week as high pressure persists over the region.

Combined seas will quickly build tonight to 20-30 ft, with the
largest waves located along the southern coastal waters. Waves will
begin to subside Tuesday into Wednesday. Waves appear to remain at
10-12 ft late into the week.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Early this morning, the Skokomish River remains in
Minor Flood Stage while the Chehalis River continues to rise but
is not expected to flood. Other area rivers have crested and are
falling, or are on track to crest below flood stage this morning.
The Flood Watch has been trimmed back to remove Snohomish, King,
and Pierce Counties, while the Flood Watch remains for areas south
and west of the Puget Sound.

The next round of precipitation will move into western Washington
today, bringing roughly 1 to 3 inches of liquid to the region.
Snow levels will lower with this storm system to 3500-4000 ft,
posing less of a threat to area rivers. The additional
precipitation is forecast to keep the Skokomish River elevated
into Minor Flood Stage through Thursday morning, while other area
rivers may enter Action Stage but are not currently forecast to
flood. A Flood Watch remains in effect for portions south and west
of the Puget Sound.

The heavy rainfall over the weekend, combined with the additional
rain today and Tuesday, increases the risk of landslides in the
mountains.
