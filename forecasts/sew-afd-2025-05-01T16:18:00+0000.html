.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the region today will promote
warm and dry conditions across western Washington. Chances of
showers return Friday into Saturday as the next system moves
into the region. High pressure will then rebuild into the region
on Sunday and promote drier and warmer conditions through early
next week. The next system looks to approach the area around
midweek.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge
over the region today will continue to promote warm and dry
conditions across western Washington. Satellite shows mostly
clear skies across the area early this morning with the
exception of some cirrus streaming in across Puget Sound. With
mostly clear skies and some lingering, shallow moisture in the
low levels, could still see some areas of patchy fog develop
across the interior this morning. Expect any areas of fog to
scatter out quickly by mid-morning and for sunny skies to
persist through the remainder of the day. Afternoon high
temperatures today will be roughly 10 to 15 degrees warmer than
yesterday- and look to climb into the upper 60s to low 70s for
areas along the coast and into the 70s across much of the
interior. A few spots around the Chehalis River Valley and along
the Cascade foothills and valleys may even approach 80 this
afternoon. Temperatures will be warm enough today for widespread
Minor (Yellow) HeatRisk.

The upper level ridge axis will then push further inland on Friday
as an upper level trough approaches the coast. A weak frontal
system moving into the area will then bring the next chance for
showers to western Washington, with rain likely approaching the
coast Friday afternoon and moving inland Friday night into
Saturday. Overall rainfall amounts look to remain rather light,
with most lowland areas likely receiving a tenth of an inch or
less. Increasing cloud cover and rain chances will allow for
temperatures to cool for areas along the coast, where highs
are only expected to climb into the upper 50s to low 60s. Southerly
flow aloft will promote warmer temperatures across the interior
on Friday afternoon, with highs expected to make it into the upper
60s to low 70s. This will maintain Minor (Yellow) HeatRisk for
lowland areas along Puget Sound on Friday.

The upper level trough will split apart as it moves inland later
on Saturday. Expect unsettled conditions to persist through the
day, with post-frontal showers becoming more confined to the
mountains by the afternoon hours. Afternoon high temperatures will
fall into the 50s to low 60s across the area.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Guidance is slowly coming
into more of a consensus that upper level ridging will rebuild
into the region by Sunday afternoon and evening. This would allow
for lingering shower activity in higher terrain to taper through
the morning hours and would promote another warming and drying
trend across western Washington heading into the first part of
next week. Mostly dry conditions look to persist through Tuesday,
with afternoon high temperatures expected to climb a few degrees
each day and top out in the low to mid 70s. This would also bring
the return of Minor (Yellow) HeatRisk to portions of the lowlands.
Ensemble clusters then indicate the ridge axis moving further
inland Wednesday into Thursday, with upper troughing developing
over the northeastern Pacific. Should these solutions come to
fruition, they would open the door for weak systems to move into
the area and bring the return of rain chances to western Washington
around midweek. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper ridge axis over the region this morning will
gradually shift eastward today with the flow aloft becoming west to
southwesterly. The air mass is dry and stable and the low level flow
is light. VFR expected areawide today. Stratus will develop along
the immediate coast late tonight as the low level flow turns onshore.

KSEA...Clear skies. Surface winds light northeasterly becoming north
to northwesterly 5 to 7 knots this afternoon. VFR throughout the
period. 27/McMillian<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak surface ridge remains over the waters into
this evening. A weakening front will move into the coastal
waters on Friday and inland Friday evening. Increasing onshore
flow behind it will likely lead to some headlines for winds
across the coastal waters and central/east portions of the
strait. Onshore flow continues into Saturday as surface ridging
builds over the coastal and offshore waters. Varying degrees of
onshore flow continue into the coming week as high pressure
remains centered offshore with lower pressure over the interior.
