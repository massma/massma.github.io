Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A trio of frontal boundaries will continue to produce
widespread precipitation this weekend across Western Washington. Rain
with high snow levels will transition to snow in the Cascades
above 3,000 feet later today as cool air sinks in behind one of
the cold fronts moving through. Breezy conditions are also
expected at times Saturday, primarily in the morning. Once the
last front sweeps through Saturday into Sunday, conditions will
dry out Monday and Tuesday before additional systems return middle
of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Latest surface analysis shows
a warm front positioned on the southwest side of Victoria Bay with
a cold front trailing just offshore. An additional cold front also
sits behind the previously mentioned fronts. This is all sitting
below an upper level closed low, with the polar jet blowing strong
winds above feeding moisture into the region. This low will track
inland over British Columbia late today and begin to fill moving
onto land.

Plenty of precipitation is already on radar this morning
(primarily along the coast and up to the Northwest Interior). Most
of the precipitation bands have been light, but a couple heavier
pockets have been observed. Gusty winds have also been observed in
pockets of the region with the initial warm front scooting by to
the north. Expectation is that the southerly wind gusts will have
already peaked early this morning (widespread 35-40 mph gusts and
a couple isolated higher gusts), and begin coming down to around
20 to 30 mph late this morning into Sunday morning.

Precipitation coverage will increase more throughout the morning
and afternoon. This will primarily be stratiform in nature, with
some convective pockets able to produce moderate to heavier rates
of precipitation. Coverage will drop off to just the Cascades
(convergence zone) going into late this afternoon and evening,
with another round of scattered showers coming in with the third
front later Saturday evening/Sunday morning, covering the whole
region. The precipitation with this system will wrap up Sunday
afternoon and evening (Cascades will be the last region to clear
out).

In terms of precipitation totals, most of the QPF will fall on
Saturday. Lowland areas will see around three quarters to just
over an inch of rain. The Olympics and Pacific Coast will see 1 to
2 and half inches of QPF (heaviest over the Olympic Mountains),
and the Cascades will be hit with generally 2 to 3 inches of QPF
(locally higher amounts of 4 to 5 inches are possible at the
highest peaks). For Sunday, lowlands and Pacific Coast will only
see around a tenth to a quarter more inch of QPF, with the
Olympics seeing half an inch to an inch, and the Cascades seeing
an additional 1-2 more inches through the day.

Cold air will bring snow levels down later Saturday afternoon to
around 3,000 feet. This will transition the rain in the Cascades
and Olympics to snow, with the majority of the snow falling in the
Cascades. There is a very low chance that freezing rain mixes in
during the precipitation transition period late this morning (this
would primarily concern areas east of Snoqualmie and Stevens Pass
with trace amounts). Otherwise the main threat will be snow, with
the heaviest of accumulations expected to be in the northern
Cascades (9 to 15 inches total Saturday through Sunday). The South
Central Cascades will still see around 6 to 10 inches of snow over
the same time period. There will be the potential for convective
snow bands able to produce heavier snowfall rates. This may also
impact trips through the passes, so be sure to check road
conditions before traveling.

With precipitation wrapping up Sunday, the concern will shift more
to high surf along the Pacific Coast Sunday morning, due to seas
building to 20 feet. resulting in breaker waves to the shoreline,
and possible localized coastal shoreline erosion.

The low will depart the region late Sunday, with ridging to follow
on Monday behind the low. This will dry out the entire region,
with some nice weather to follow Monday and into Tuesday. Patchy
fog will be possible (in the morning), and temperatures will cool back
down into the low 30s for overnight temperatures (with highs in
the 40s).

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The upper level ridge
pattern will continue with dry weather on Tuesday. Behind the
ridge, there`s disagreements in the operational and ensemble
models on what will follow, but a majority of members agree on
troughing returning in the second half of the week. This has
resulted in increased precipitation chances going into this
timeframe. Check back for more details as more is known getting
closer to the middle of the week next week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A pair of fronts moving through today and tonight.
Southwesterly flow aloft today becoming northwesterly tonight.
Increasing low level onshore flow tonight behind second front.

MVFR ceilings into Sunday morning with pockets of IFR along the
coast and over the Kitsap peninsula. Convergence zone developing
near KPAE late afternoon into the evening hours with possible IFR
ceilings in the convergence zone as well. VFR ceilings Central and
South Puget Sound while convergence zone is intact.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings with visibility 3-5sm in rain at times
into this afternoon. VFR ceilings for a few hours late afternoon
into the evening hours with convergence zone well north of the
terminal. Ceilings lowering back down to MVFR overnight into
Sunday morning. South wind 4 to 8 knots increasing to 10 to 15
knots this afternoon into Sunday morning. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A pair of frontal systems will cross the waters in
quick succession this morning and again tonight. Surface high
pressure will rebuild across the waters Sunday afternoon and move
inland Sunday night. The ridge will remain over the waters into
Tuesday. Another front will reach the area Wednesday night.

Small craft advisory winds Central and Eastern Strait later today
into tonight. Small craft advisory winds over portions of the
coastal waters tonight and Sunday.

Seas around 10 feet today building to 14 to 19 feet tonight.
Seas subsiding to 12 to 14 feet Sunday night and to below 10 feet
Monday.

Another round of small craft advisory winds possible with frontal
system in the middle of next week along with seas in the coastal
waters in the 10 to 14 foot range. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Systems moving through the area today will bring
significant precipitation to the area especially the mountains.
Snow levels climbing to 7000 to 9000 feet during the bulk of the
heavier rain today. This combined with the heavier rainfall, will
result in rises on rivers across the region. While the
precipitation forecast continues to fluctuate a bit run to run, 2
to 3 inches of rainfall appears most likely result. However, high
end potential amounts would reach into the 4 to 5 inch range
across portions of the Olympics and the northern and central
Cascades. As a result, a flood potential outlook (ESF) remains in
effect for Whatcom, Skagit, and Snohomish counties. A Flood Watch
remains in effect for Mason County for the Skokomish River.
Current forecast for the Skokomish has it cresting barely below
flood stage Sunday morning. A brief period of drier conditions
will allow for rivers to recede early next week, but another round
of hydrologically significant precipitation may follow later next
week. Bower/Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.CLIMATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The rain held off at Seattle-Tacoma airport with just a
trace of rain right before midnight last night. This means the
first 6 days of December had no measurable rain in Seattle. How
rare is this event? Very rare. In 80 years of records at Seattle-
Tacoma airport this is only the 3rd time there has been no
measurable precipitation in the first 6 days of December at the
airport ( other years 1997 and 1984 ). The longest dry streak in
December in Seattle is 21 days during the infamous fog ridge of
December 1985 that made a mess of holiday travel. In December 1985
there was no measurable rain at Seattle-Tacoma airport December
8th through the 28th. For 13 days in a row, December 16th through
the 28th, Seattle-Tacoma airport reported visibility of a 1/4 of a
mile or less at some point during the day. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
