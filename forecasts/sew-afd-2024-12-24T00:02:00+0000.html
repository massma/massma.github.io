Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
402 PM PST Mon Dec 23 2024

.SYNOPSIS...The active pattern continues with multiple frontal
systems moving through the area bringing periods of rain, mountain
snow, and gusty winds. The focus shifts towards Christmas into
late next week with potentially higher-impact systems with heavy
rain and snow and gusty winds, especially when combined with
holiday travel.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High clouds are beginning
to fill in across western Washington this afternoon, with rain
beginning to show up offshore on radar. This system will arrive
and move through the area fairly quickly this evening into early
tomorrow morning, bringing a quick round of rain and light
mountain snow tonight into early tomorrow morning. Of larger
concern will be the winds, where east winds will pick up
overnight. Strongest winds will be in the gaps in the terrain
along the Cascade foothills, reaching gusts up to 45 to 55 mph, where
a wind advisory will be in effect. Some strong locally gusty
winds are also possible along portions of the Pacific coast.

A brief break between systems is expected Tuesday night into early
Christmas morning before the next system arrives Wednesday
afternoon and will continue through Thursday. This system will
have more of an atmospheric river setup and will contain a
significant amount of QPF. The highest rainfall totals will be
over the coast and Olympics for around 3 to 4 inches of rain with
locally higher amounts in the highest peaks. An inch to one and a
half inches is likely for the lowlands. Consequentially, snow
levels will lower to around 3000 feet over the Cascades, causing
heavy accumulating snow at all of the passes. Wind will again pick
up late Wednesday morning from the south, with the windiest
locations being the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca, northern Puget
Sound and Salish sea and along the immediate coast.

Building waves along the coast will create multiple periods of
high surf conditions Monday through Wednesday. Long period waves
causing significant run-up and erosion will transition into
shorter period waves with large breakers Tuesday through Thursday.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...The active pattern continues
Friday into this weekend as additional system work their way
through the area. Additional heavy snow, rainfall, and periods of
breezy winds and high surf conditions along the coast are
expected through much of the long term forecast period. Ensemble
models are hinting in at least a brief period of some high
pressure building into the area early next week, perhaps bringing
a brief break in the back-to-back series of systems.

Additionally, high tide levels will begin increase this weekend
into early next week. The active pattern will need to monitored
for the potential of coastal flooding impacts.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Strong southwest flow aloft will develop tonight as
a vigorous area of low pressure offshore pushes a front into
Western Washington early Tuesday morning. Ceilings will lower to
MVFR at times in rain along the coast 03Z-06Z with said conditions
spreading to interior lowland terminals 06Z-10Z. Stratiform rain
will transition to scattered showers with ceilings lifting back to
mostly VFR across the area around mid-morning Tuesday. Increasing
low level easterly flow late this afternoon and evening will lead
gusty easterlies...particularly near gaps in terrain.

KSEA...Rain with the next front is expected to reach the terminal
around 04Z this evening. With strong low level easterly flow this
evening, ceilings will gradually lower to 2000 to 3000 feet
by around 09Z. MVFR ceilings in rain will persist through mid-
morning Tuesday before turning to scattered post-frontal showers
with ceilings lifting back to primarily VFR. Surface winds
easterly increasing this evening and becoming gusty...especially 02Z-
07Z with gusts to 20-25 knots at times. Winds becoming southerly
8-12 knots around 12Z Tuesday with gusts 15-20 knots into midday. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Strengthening easterly winds across the waters
this evening as a developing surface low well offshore continues to
deepen as it tracks north toward Haida Gwaii. The associated front
will push across the waters overnight through early Tuesday with
developing gales over the coastal waters and near the Strait of Juan
de Fuca`s eastern entrance (and advisory strength winds elsewhere).
Meanwhile, seas over the coastal waters continue to run several feet
above guidance and will hold in the 17 to 22 ft range into early
Tuesday before subsiding a little bit later Tuesday and into
Wednesday.

A stronger frontal system will closely follow into the waters on
Wednesday, with the potential for more widespread gales and the
potential for local storm force winds over portions of the waters.
Meanwhile, this will bring another round of larger seas, with
conditions again building above 20 feet. The pattern then looks to
remain active with yet another frontal system moving across the
waters over the weekend. 12<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A series of atmospheric rivers will move through western
Washington through the next several days and bring additional rounds
of precipitation. The most hydrologically significant system will be
the atmospheric rivers arriving Christmas into Friday morning, with
active conditions likely persisting over the weekend.

The Skokomish river will continue in minor flood stage tonight
before receding below flood stage on Tuesday. However, this
recession will be short lived as the next round of moderate to heavy
rainfall arrives on Wednesday and continues thereafter as more
systems take hold of the region. A rise into moderate flood stage is
possible by Thursday.

Updated river forecasts in the southwest interior such as the
Chehalis and Newaukum are now forecast to NOT reach flood stage as
recent collaboration with the RFC has shown QPF has lessened. As a
result, these rivers are favored to top out in Action Stage but
we`ll continue to assess the situation. Additionally, a handful of
Cascade basins and rivers continue to show potential for at least
Action Stage but will need to be monitored as well. All of the
precipitation also carries an increased risk of landslides which, if
they occur, have the potential to impact holiday travels.
