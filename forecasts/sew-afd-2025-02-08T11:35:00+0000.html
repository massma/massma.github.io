Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
335 AM PST Sat Feb 8 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level trough over Western Washington today
moving southeast tonight. Snow levels remaining near the surface
this morning. Narrow high amplitude ridge off the British Columbia
coast tonight into Sunday with drier northwesterly flow aloft.
Another upper level trough swinging through Monday from the
north. With the over land trajectory of this feature little
moisture will be associated with it. Dry northwesterly flow aloft
continuing into Wednesday. Pattern breaks down late next week with
a weather system possibly moving into the area by Friday.
Temperatures remaining below normal through the period.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
upper level trough axis over the area this morning. Doppler radar
has widespread precipitation over the interior from about Everett
southward. The precipitation is light and in the form of snow
except in the lower elevations of Lewis county. Temperatures at 3
am/11z were in the upper 20s to mid 30s.

Upper level trough axis moving through early this morning.
Satellite imagery not showing much precipitation behind the trough
axis but as long as the trough is in the vicinity will keep a
chance of showers in the forecast. Snow levels will remain near
the surface this morning then lift a couple hundred feet in the
afternoon. Snow accumulations will be less than an inch. Highs
mostly in the upper 30s.

High amplitude, but narrow, upper level ridge building offshore
tonight with the ridge extending all the way into Alaska. Some
residual showers lingering around in the evening but for the most
part it looks like a dry period. Cloud cover will keep lows mostly
in the mid 20s to lower 30s.

Upper level ridge remaining in place with dry northwesterly flow
aloft over the area Sunday. Light flow in the lower levels
combined with low level moisture will keep skies mostly cloudy.
Highs remaining cool, a couple of degrees either side of 40.

Ridge hanging in there Sunday night. Upper level trough along the
backside of the ridge moving down over the area Monday. This
feature will have an over land track through British Columbia so
there will be little in the way of moisture with it. There is a
chance it will mix things up enough Monday for some sunshine.
With the northerly flow aloft the air mass will remain cool with
highs once again near 40. A little less cloud cover Sunday night
will allow lows drop into the 20s with upper teens possible in the
colder locations. If the forecast holds look for another round of
cold weather advisories for Sunday night/early Monday morning.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Models in good agreement
Tuesday and Wednesday with the narrow high amplitude ridge
remaining offshore extending well to the north and dry northerly
flow aloft over the area. Tuesday and Wednesday morning have a
good chance of being the coldest mornings so far this season with
the cold air mass overhead, clearing skies and light winds. Lows
in the teens and lower 20s. Even with sunshine highs will only be
in the mid 30s to lower 40s.

Confidence in Thursday and Friday very low. Model solutions are
very inconsistent and the ensembles are not much help. There is a
general consensus that the chances for precipitation increase
especially Friday but how the pattern evolves is up for debate.
The ECMWF solutions bring another cool upper level trough and an
accompanying shortwave down the British Columbia coast Friday.
The GFS solutions have a negatively tilted front arriving from
the southwest. Both solutions have a wide variety of results
depending on timing and track of the features. The forecast right
now is a broad brush chance of rain or snow with low snow levels,
around 500 feet. Doubt this forecast survives more than a run or
two before changing. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak upper trough will move across Western
Washington today with west to northwest flow aloft. The low level
flow is light. Ceilings will deteriorate to MVFR across the area
with scattered snow showers transitioning to a mix of rain and snow
showers by afternoon.

KSEA...MVFR in scattered snow showers becoming a mix of rain and
snow showers by 18Z. Surface winds light easterly this morning
becoming light and variable this afternoon.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak surface trough over the coastal waters this
morning will shift inland this afternoon. A ridge will rebuild over
the offshore waters late today and remain in place into Sunday.
Surface ridging over the interior of British Columbia will
strengthen early in the coming week for modest offshore flow and
Fraser River outflow. A weakening trough will approach the coastal
waters late next week.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
