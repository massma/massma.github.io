Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
908 AM PST Tue Dec 10 2024

.SYNOPSIS...High pressure through Wednesday with dry but cool
conditions. Rain chances then increase Wednesday night through
the weekend as a series of disturbances take aim. Saturday could
bring gusty winds with an increased risk of coastal flooding,
particularly along the Pacific coast.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure has settled
directly over the region today, which will keep conditions dry
across western Washington. Clear skies overnight led to sufficient
cooling across the region- with current temperatures this morning
mostly in the 30s across the area. Areas of fog have also developed
across Puget Sound and the southwest interior overnight. With
visibilities still down to a quarter mile in some spots, will
leave the Dense Fog Advisory in effect for Thurston and Lewis
counties through 10AM. Expect fog to lift and scatter through the
morning and afternoon for some sun across western Washington
today. The remainder of the previous discussion follows below,
with updates made to the aviation section below. 14

High pressure will maintain through the first half of Wednesday
before a disturbance arrives late Wednesday night into Thursday.
Most of its energy looks to be focused towards N California but we
could see PoPs increase across the area as showers return to the
forecast. It doesn`t appear to be a washout but this feature looks
to open up the pattern for additional disturbances for the
remainder of the week. High temperatures looks to remain generally
in the 40s throughout the short term but could flirt near 50 F on
Wednesday. Overnight lows are to bottom in the 30s.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Relatively quiet conditions
appear likely into Friday as transient ridging passes overhead.
But, the pattern will turn active again into Saturday as an
upper-low drifts off the NE PAC into our neck of the woods. Here
we`ll see widespread rain, mountain snow, and the possibly gusty
winds. Looking at the NBM probabilities, there is a 40-50% chance
of peak gusts in excess of 45 mph along the coast and through the
north interior Saturday. For 60 mph, those probabilities fall to
10-20% across the north interior and 10-30% along the Pacific
coast. This outcome is highly dependent on the exact track of low
pressure center. Astronomical tides will peak again this weekend
into early next week along the outer coast (early to mid next week
along the inner coast). The potential combination of a sub-1000mb
surface low, the tides, and increased surf activity will need to
be monitored closely. Conditions may relax briefly into the
beginning of next week but confidence is not particularly high at
this time.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge over the area slowly moving east.
Northwesterly flow aloft becoming southwesterly this afternoon.
Light offshore flow in the lower levels.

Fog along I-5 corridor from about Seattle southward with LIFR/IFR
ceilings and visibility. The layer continues to be shallow with
tops near 500 feet and will start to dissipate around 18z-20z.
High clouds this afternoon and tonight will limit fog development
Wednesday morning with localized patchy fog near the Puget Sound
12z-18z Wednesday.

KSEA...Terminal right at the top of the fog layer this morning
making for widely varying conditions through 18z. Lowest
conditions from 15z-18z as fog layer lifts up over the terminal
before dissipating. High clouds this afternoon and tonight.
Northeast wind 4 to 8 knots. Felton/Mazurkiewicz<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure over the waters will weaken
into Wednesday. A splitting front will reach the area late
Wednesday into Thursday. High pressure will briefly rebuild Friday
before a significantly stronger storm system arrives over the
weekend.

Small craft advisory winds and or seas over the coastal waters
with the weakening front Thursday and Thursday night. More
widespread small craft advisory winds possible over the weekend
with a stronger system. Seas building above 10 feet Friday night
will be in the 12 to 16 foot range over the weekend. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Next round of precipitation with a weak system
Thursday will only result in small rises on the rivers. A
stronger storm will set up along the coast over the weekend with
potential to bring more significant precipitation to the region.
While area rivers will rise only the Skokomish River is currently
forecast to potentially reach minor flood stage. There is still
some uncertainty in the precipitation amounts over the weekend.
Conditions will continue to be monitored. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SEW WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>WA...Dense Fog Advisory until 10 AM PST this morning for Hood Canal
     Area-Southwest Interior.
