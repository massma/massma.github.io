Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
332 PM EDT Sat May 11 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system approaches from the west tonight and then
passes south and east of the area on Sunday. High pressure
returns Sunday night. A warm front passes north of the area
Monday into Tuesday. Low pressure may impact the area for the
middle of the week, with another frontal system possible by next
weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SUNDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A large upper level trough remains over Eastern North America.
Within this trough, a middle level ridge will push east of the
area tonight, followed by a shortwave trough. At the surface,
high pressure continues to ridge down from northern New England.
The approaching shortwave will bring an increase in cloud cover
this evening into tonight. An associated frontal system will
slowly approach with lift increasing west of the NYC metro
between around 03 and 06z. Showers will accompany the increased
lift, especially across NE NJ and the Lower Hudson Valley,
slowly making their way towards the NYC metro around day break.
Mainly light showers are expected with a small chance for a
brief occurrence of moderate intensity.

A chilly night is in store despite the increasing cloud cover.
Lows look to fall into the middle and upper 40s for most spots and
around 50 degrees in the NYC metro. These low temperatures range
from 5-10 degrees below normal for this time of year.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The aforementioned shortwave becomes a broad closed low
overhead early Sunday morning. There will be two separate areas
of middle level energy within the low, one to our northeast and
then another to our south and west. The models are also in good
agreement with the cutoff low quickly shifting to our east
around midday. The remaining energy to our south and west will
shift to a less favorable position for supporting the shower
activity. The upper trough and cutoff low will then slowly shift
to a position near or just off the New England coast Sunday
evening.

Showers, mainly on the light side, will continue from around
the NYC metro/Hudson River corridor in the morning. The showers
will try to shift eastward in the morning, but will likely
encounter subsidence behind the lead energy and slowly dissipate
as they move over southern CT and western/central Long Island.
The showers will continue to dissipate early in the afternoon
with dry conditions likely returning around 19z. Total rainfall
amounts range from one to two tenths west of the NYC metro, a
few hundredths to a tenth in the NYC metro, and possibly a trace
to see a few hundredths east of the Hudson and NYC metro.
Locations on the east end and southeast CT may remain completely
dry. Lingering middle level moisture likely leads to mostly
cloudy skies for the remainder of the daytime hours.

The other story for Sunday will be unseasonably cool
temperatures with highs only reaching the middle and upper 50s.
These highs are 10-15 degrees below normal for this time of
year.

Heights will rise Sunday night as the upper trough continues
departing to the east. Surface high pressure will be in place
leading to dry conditions. Clouds should slowly diminish
through the night with mostly clear to partly cloudy skies by
early Monday morning. Another chilly night is expected with lows
in the 40s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Dry wx is expected on Mon with high pres along the coast. Sly
flow develops during the day with a warm front to the N and sea
breeze impacts. This will modify temps for most of the area E
of the Hudson River. With the boundary to the N and some energy
embedded in the flow aloft, a few shwrs are possible Mon ngt and
Tue. Greater instability could yield some tstms N and W of NYC
Tue aftn and eve, then low pres approaches from the SW and rain,
with a few embedded tstms, overspreads the area Tue ngt into
Wed. Despite the cool ocean, the warm airmass yields highs in
the 60s and 70s on Tue per the NBM. Mixing down the GFS from h85
would produce mid 70s without adding in the seasonal solar
adjustment which would bring the numbers to around 80. Stuck
with the NBM for now, but some higher readings possible in NJ
and up the wrn portion of the Hudson Valley. Clouds and residual
rain keep temps lower on Wed, then pcpn chances subside Wed ngt
into Thu. Temps rebound on Thu with more sunshine despite nely
flow. Another frontal sys is possible late Fri into Sat. The
timing and track are a little uncertain, with the ECMWF slower
than the GFS. As a result, the blended approach using the NBM
was used.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /19Z SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak high pressure building in from New England this afternoon
will give way to an approaching weak frontal system tonight
into early Sunday.

BKN VFR cigs inland should expand toward the NYC metros and KISP
late today into this evening. VFR expected much of tonight, then
light showers with MVFR cond should arrive at KSWF after 08Z, to
KHPN and the NYC metro 09Z-10Z, and KBDR/KISP by 12Z. Can`t rule
out brief IFR cigs at KSWF during mid to late morning. KGON
should remain VFR.

SE-S flow either side of 10 kt (with the higher speeds closer to
the coast) should diminish to under 10 kt tonight, and may go
light/vrb at outlying terminals. SE flow under 10 kt expected
daytime Sunday.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

No unscheduled AMD expected.

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...

Late Sunday afternoon and Sunday night: VFR.

Monday: Mainly VFR.

Tuesday: MVFR or lower possible in mainly afternoon showers.
S winds 15kt coastal terminals.

Tuesday night: MVFR likely in showers and possible tstms.
S winds 10-15kt coastal terminals.

Wednesday: MVFR or lower still likely in showers and t-storms.
SE winds 10-15G20kt, becoming NE.

Wednesday night: VFR. N winds 10-15G20kt.

Thursday: VFR.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Seas east of Moriches Inlet are likely to end up around 4 ft this
evening and may occasionally reach 5 ft. Not anticipating the need
for an SCA. Conditions will remain below SCA levels through Tuesday
night with a weak pressure gradient over the waters. There could
be period of marginal 5 ft seas on the ocean Mon and Tue. A SCA
will be needed on the ocean Wed with low pressure, and possible
elsewhere. SCA cond may linger through Thu, subsiding by Fri.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No hydrologic impacts expected through next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Only localized minor coastal flooding is expected for the
most vulnerable locations along the south shore back bays of
Nassau County with high tide tonight. A coastal flood statement
remain in effect. Otherwise, no additional coastal flooding is
anticipated as astronomical tide levels continue subsiding into
early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
