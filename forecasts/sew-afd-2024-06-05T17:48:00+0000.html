Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
1048 AM PDT Wed Jun 5 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A pattern change commences today as upper level
ridging starts to build over the region. This will bring a warming
and drying trend to western Washington for the second half of the
week. The warmest temperatures are expected Friday and Saturday.
A weak shortwave moving across the area on Sunday may bring
slightly cooler temperatures and some showers to the mountains.
Temperatures then look to fall closer to normal by early next
week.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Forecast remains on track
this morning. Previous discussion follows. Some areas of patchy
fog and low clouds this morning will lift and scatter by the late
morning hours for a return to some afternoon sunshine. Afternoon
highs today will warm closer to normal and look to top out in the
upper 60s to low 70s across the interior and in the low to mid 60s
for areas along the coast.

Upper level ridging will continue to amplify across the West Coast
on Thursday and Friday, allowing for temperatures to continue to
warm a couple degrees each day. High temperatures on Thursday
look to top out in the upper 60s to mid 70s for the majority of
the area. Overnight lows look to warm a few degrees each day as
well and will range in the upper 40s to low 50s area-wide on
Friday. Friday currently looks to be the warmest day of the week,
with afternoon highs looking to top out in the mid 70s to mid 80s
for the majority of the region. Heat risk is generally expected to
remain in the minor category for the majority of western Washington
for now, though could see some isolated spots of moderate heat
risk primarily along the Cascade valleys on Friday - where
temperatures could climb into the mid to upper 80s.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Warm and dry conditions
will continue into Saturday as the upper level ridge axis pushes
further inland. Overnight low temperatures on Saturday will be in
the low to mid 50s across the region, with highs expected to top
out in the upper 70s to low 80s. The coast will be cooler under
increased cloud cover, with highs expected to be in the mid 60s
to mid 70s. Heat risk will be minor on Saturday. A weak shortwave
trough looks to move across the area on Sunday. At this time,
guidance does not indicate much in the way of precipitation
outside of a few showers in the mountains. However, can expect
cloudier conditions and for highs to cool into the low to mid 70s
across the interior and low to mid 60s along the coast. Heading
into next week, ensembles continue to favor troughing over the
northeastern Pacific and ridging over the western US. A few weak
shortwaves may move across western Washington early in the week
for occasional cloud cover and temperatures near to only slightly
above normal. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
