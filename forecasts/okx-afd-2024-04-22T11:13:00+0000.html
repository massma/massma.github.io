Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
713 AM EDT Mon Apr 22 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure will generally be in control through Tuesday
morning, before shifting offshore and weakening Tuesday
afternoon and night. A warm front will move through late Tuesday
night into Wednesday morning, followed by a cold front Wednesday
afternoon. High pressure will then build into the region
Wednesday night, and move off the Northeast coast on Friday.
A frontal system may impact the area for the weekend.
High pressure will briefly return Sunday night into Monday.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
Under mostly clear skies, temps across some interior valley
spots and in parts of eastern Long Island have fallen below
freezing, with upper 20s/lower 30s. Some mid 30s readings had
also made it down to the SE CT coast and into much of the rest
of the interior and across eastern Long Island where winds were
relatively light. This should also be the case tonight, and have
issued a freeze warning for late tonight into early Tue AM for
Orange County, and frost advisories for much of the interior
and across eastern Long Island.

Prior to that, after the chilly start to this morning, temps
should recover on a downslope NW flow (with an afternoon sea
breeze along the coast east of a developing thermal trough).
High temps should reach the lower 60s in urban NE NJ, the upper
50s most elsewhere, and mid 50s across eastern Long Island and
coastal SE CT.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
A southerly flow will set up daytime Tue as the sfc high moves
to the east and weakens in between an approaching cold front
well off to the west, and a developing ocean storm. Temps should
once again reach the mid/upper 50s along the coast, with lower
60s inland and some mid 60s in urban NE NJ.

Expect an increase in clouds ahead of the approaching front Tue
night, with chance of showers from NYC north/west late, then
throughout Wed morning as a warm front passes through. A cold
front and strong mid level shortwave trough will move through in
the afternoon, and if NAM fcst soundings are correct should be
accompanied by a band of showers/tstms, with likely PoP inland
and chance PoP for NYC/Long Island/coastal SE CT. Stronger
cells could produce gusty winds given dry sub-cloud air and
steep low level lapse rates. High temps look to be a little
warmer across the board, with widespread lower/mid 60s, possibly
upper 60s in NE NJ and NYC.

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...
High pressure will be in control Wednesday night into Friday
night with a cool airmass in place, and temperatures below
seasonal normals. With late April temperatures below normal,
frost and freeze headlines will be possible across much of the
area Wednesday night and Thursday night.

A warm front approaches Saturday and slowly moves into the area
through Sunday as the associated low remains in the western
Great Lakes region. A return southerly flow sets up Friday night
with high pressure off the northeast coast. And a southerly
flow, and the approach and possible warm frontal passage will
bring temperatures to levels 5 to 10 degrees above normal
Saturday and Sunday. There will be chances for showers with the
warm front, however, there remain timing uncertainties with the
movement of the front. There a also a low chance of isolated
thunder Sunday with some CAPE and developing surface
instability. However, with the uncertainty of the warm front
position, low chance of thunder, late in the forecast period,
will not mention thunder at this time.

.MARINE...
Quiet conditions on the waters through Tue evening. Increasing S
flow ahead of a cold front should build ocean seas above 5 ft
late Tue night into Wed. NY Harbor could also see a few gusts up
to 25 in W-NW flow after fropa late day Wed.

Ocean seas remain elevated Wednesday night behind the cold
front, and gusts during the evening may briefly reach SCA
levels as departing low pressure deepens. The non ocean waters
will be below advisory levels Wednesday night through
Thursday.

Ocean seas gradually subside late Wednesday night in a weakening
NW, falling below advisory levels Thursday morning. Winds and
seas across the forecast waters then remain below advisory
levels through Friday night.
