Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
206 PM PDT Sun May 4 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Warming and dry weather will persist through Tuesday.
Chances of showers will increase Wednesday and Thursday as a weak
system moves through western Washington. Drier conditions return
with near to slightly above normal temperatures late in the
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Dry conditions
with scattered fair weather cumulus dominate the region this
afternoon. A ridge of high pressure is beginning to nose its
way into the Pacific Northwest today. This ridge will slide east
over the region through the next couple of days, bringing a
quick warming trend to the region. High temperatures will peak
on Tuesday this week in the 70s across much of the region to
near 80 for locations in the southwest interior and Cascade
foothills.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>As the ridge pushes
east, the next wave will impact the region Wednesday and
Thursday bringing temperatures back down into the 60s. This
system will also bring fairly widespread chances for showers.
That said, precipitation totals will likely remain minimal.

Ensemble guidance is in relatively good agreement that another
break in the weather is expected Friday into at least early
Saturday as high pressure amplifies ahead of an incoming trough.
This will allow temperature warm back towards the upper 60s to
low 70s. Confidence begins to fall by during the day Saturday
and certainly from Sunday and beyond. Looking at the latest
cluster analysis, Sunday will need to be monitored for potential
convection as one cluster with ~25% membership indicates the
potential for a somewhat negatively tilted trough and notable
CAPE values. That said, the other 75% of members show little to
nothing of significance.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light onshore flow continues over the coastal waters as
a surface high remains offshore. Generally benign conditions over
the waters will continue through the first half of the week. A
weak frontal system arriving just around midweek could bring an
uptick in winds and seas.

Coastal seas 4 to 6 feet throughout the first half of the week,
gradually increasing to around 6 to 8 feet by Wednesday.
