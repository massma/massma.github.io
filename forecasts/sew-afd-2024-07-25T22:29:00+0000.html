Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
329 PM PDT Thu Jul 25 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level trough moving off to the northeast today.
Weaker upper level trough moving over the area for Friday and the
weekend. A frontal system will move inland mostly over British
Columbia Monday with the southern end of the front moving through
Western Washington. Upper level trough axis moving through Tuesday
with a weak upper level ridge beginning to build Wednesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low is over
the region today for an increase in clouds and mountain showers
(mainly North Cascades). Temperature-wise, we`re cooler and in the
60s to lower 70s today given the pattern. Showers will mainly
impact the North Cascades overnight as the low shifts NE toward
northern Alberta/Saskatchewan.

A weak trough will remain over the area Friday through the
weekend with dry weather. The flow will remain onshore and we`re
expecting mild, seasonal conditions. Temperatures will be close to
our late July normals. 33

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...A deeper trough shifts over
the region Monday and Tuesday for cooler and wetter conditions.
Tapping into some moisture over the Pacific, there`s at least a
70% chance of seeing measurable precipitation across all of
western WA. And in the mountains, there`s even a 50-60% chance of
seeing wetting rains over 0.25". Moving forward, upper level
ridging looks to build and strengthen over the Rockies with broad
ridging extending into the Pac NW. This brings warmer
temperatures to the region Wednesday and Thursday with highs
reaching the lower to mid 80s again (in the interior). NW winds
will keep the coast cooler and in the 70s. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low will continue to move eastward
into Alberta tonight while upper level ridging remains situated over
the northeastern Pacific. This will maintain west to northwest
flow aloft over western Washington through the TAF period.

Satellite shows cloud cover continuing to scatter across western
Washington this afternoon. Overall conditions at area terminals
have returned to VFR. Winds at the surface primarily remain out
of the southwest at 5-10 kt this afternoon, but will gradually
turn to the northwest late this afternoon into this evening.
Another round of marine stratus will push inland on Friday
morning, but should stay just west of the majority of the east
Puget Sound terminals. Ceilings may drop to MVFR or even IFR in
areas of stratus for a few hours Friday morning, before scattering
out around 18Z.

KSEA...VFR conditions expected through tonight. Winds persisting
out of the southwest this afternoon at 4 to 8 kt, becoming
northwest at 6 to 10 kt between 01-03Z. Marine stratus looks to
stay just west of the terminal Friday morning, with latest NBM
probabilistic guidance only hinting at a 20% chance of conditions
falling to MVFR. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the northeastern Pacific will
interact with lower pressure inland east of the Cascades through
the weekend, promoting onshore flow and northwest winds in the
coastal waters. A small craft advisory remains in effect for the
central and eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca for westerly winds
15-20 kt with frequent gusts to 25 kt through late tonight. Winds
will then ease again during the overnight hours. The outer coastal
waters may see occasional northwesterly winds up to 20 kt, with
gusts to 25 kt Friday evening into Saturday. Additional pushes of
westerly winds also look likely down the Strait, so additional
rounds of headlines will be possible over the next few days. A
frontal system then looks to move into the area waters on Monday.

Wave heights over the coastal waters will generally range between
3 to 6 feet through the next several days. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
