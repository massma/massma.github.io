Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
148 PM PDT Mon Aug 5 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough will move through on Tuesday,
allowing temperatures to ease to near normal. Temperatures will
begin to rise following, peaking late in the week. Several upper-
level disturbances will promote chances for thunderstorms over the
Cascades late week and into the weekend. Above average
temperatures and dry conditions continue through this coming
weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Marine stratus clouds
remain in place along the coast, slowly burning off this
afternoon. Temperatures across most of the region are in the upper
60s to low 70s, though in the low 60s where cloud cover remains.

The large and persistent ridge remains centered over the Four
Corners region, while a shortwave trough sits just off the coast.
This trough will move through western Washington on Tuesday,
bringing with it a substantial push of onshore flow, allowing for
temperatures to cool slightly, with highs around normal--60s along
the coast, with mid to upper 70s to near 80 elsewhere. Another
cloudy start to the day Tuesday with widespread marine stratus
filling in through the interior, as it has the past few days. As
this trough exits the region, an upper level low drifts southward
through the Canadian Prairies and builds back westward towards the
region on Wednesday, which will continue through late week.
Ensemble guidance indicates a warming trend through the end of the
week, with Thursday being the warmest day for most. Highs will
top out in the 80s to low 90s, and 70s along the coast. Lows will
be in the mid 50s to low 60s. HeatRisk values will largely be
Orange/Moderate, with a few pockets of Red/Major in the Cascade
valleys. There will also be a chance for some isolated
thunderstorms over the Cascades Thursday afternoon, though they
should be isolated and confidence is fairly low (10-20% chance).

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Friday will be another warm
day with highs very similar or a few degrees cooler compared to
Thursday. High temperatures will remain above normal, in the 80s
through the interior and 70s along the coast through the long
term period. Lows will remain the 50s to low 60s as well. Models
are showing that upper-level troughing should continue through
the weekend though the exact details differ between models.
Chances increase Friday afternoon for the potential for
thunderstorms over the Cascades (25-35% chance) and that potential
may continue into the weekend.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mostly VFR with areas of MVFR/IFR in marine stratus
along the coast. A marine push will cause stratus to spread inland
early Tuesday morning, lowering most terminals to MVFR/IFR.
Generally light W/SW winds through the TAF period.

KSEA...VFR with a return to IFR early Tuesday in low stratus.
Ceilings will likely lower between 09z-11z and stay IFR through
roughly 17z-19z before scattering out. Winds generally W to SW 8 to
12 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A persistent pattern will continue across the region
through early next week with broad high pressure offshore and
lower pressure inland. Diurnally driven westerly winds through the
Strait of Juan de Fuca will continue, with Small Craft Advisory
winds expected this evening and potentially again Tuesday evening
as well. Onshore flow will weaken later Wednesday into late week.
Persistent northwest winds will continue over the outer coastal
waters. Steep conditions over the next few days for the outer
coastal waters with seas generally 5 to 6 feet.
