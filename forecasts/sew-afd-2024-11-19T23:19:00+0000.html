Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
319 PM PST Tue Nov 19 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong offshore storm system will continue to strengthen today,
generating significant east to southeast winds across western
Washington alongside widespread lowland rain and mountain snow today
into Wednesday. Troughing offshore will continue through the rest of
the week, maintaining unsettled conditions across the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An anomalously strong low
pressure system offshore will continue to strengthen into the
evening tonight, generating strong pressure gradients that will
cause significant east to southeast winds across western Washington.
The strongest winds are on track to ramp up quickly and occur along
the Pacific Coast and western Cascade Foothills, where gusts could
reach 60-65 mph this evening. Wind gusts elsewhere will likely peak
in the 40-50 mph range this evening. The strong winds through the
Cascade gaps combined with incoming snowfall will cause blizzard
conditions through the Cascade Passes this evening through early
Wednesday morning, where visibilities will be reduced at times to
whiteout conditions in blowing snow. With snow levels between 2000-
3000 ft, the Cascade Passes will see snow totals of 3 to 7 inches
with up to 12 inches over higher elevations through Wednesday
afternoon. The lowlands will also see steady rainfall through
Wednesday morning before rainfall transitions to showers, with
accumulations up to half an inch in the interior and up to an inch
and a half along the Pacific Coast.

The low situated offshore will weaken and shift northward on
Wednesday, swinging another front across western Washington that
will maintain shower activity throughout the day as winds slowly
ease. A large upper level trough will stall offshore through the
remainder of the week, with a series of shortwave disturbances set
to pass northward across the region. This will continually bring
moisture northward into the area, maintaining scattered showers and
cloudy skies. Precipitation amounts will lighten with snow levels
lifting to 3000-4000 ft by Thursday and above 4000-5000 ft by
Friday. The Cascade Passes will see continued light snowfall
accumulations on Thursday and Friday with little to no impact to
travel.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Extended forecast models
show potential for an active weather pattern to continue into early
next week. Ensemble cluster analysis shows good agreement over
general troughing through the weekend and next week, but models show
uncertainty over the intensity and placement of storm systems.
Forecast runs continue to show inconsistent solutions, so a chance
for lowland rain and light mountain snow has been maintained through
the forecast period.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>South/southwesterly flow will persist aloft as a
strong low pressure system moves northward well offshore. Latest
radar shows rain starting to move up along the coast from the south
this afternoon. Conditions at area terminals have generally
rebounded to widespread VFR. Rain will continue to push into the
area from the south and west this afternoon and evening and linger
into Wednesday morning.

The biggest aviation challenge will remain the winds this evening,
as the aforementioned strong area of low pressure will generate
strong easterly winds across much of the interior. North to south
oriented runways will face some crosswind challenges, with gusts up
to 35 kts, maybe even 45 kts. The higher gusts will be mainly
focused near the Cascade foothills, but we will see sustained
easterly winds through much of the interior around 20 to 30 kts.
Winds have already started to increase across the coastal terminals
this afternoon and expect interior terminals to start to see an
increase in winds by 00Z. With east/southeasterly flow helping to
dry out the low levels, expect ceilings remain VFR through tonight.
Winds will peak tonight into early Wednesday, before gradually
easing through the morning and afternoon hours. Ceilings will
gradually lower towards more widespread MVFR by 12Z Wednesday
coinciding with winds easing, though some areas could potentially
see some visibility restrictions earlier as heavier showers move
over area terminals.

Additionally, there is a possibility for a subtle ridgetop inversion
in the Cascades, which could generate some mountain wave activity
that may impact terminals near Puget Sound. Confidence on this
scenario is low (less than 15-20 percent), but it is something to be
aware of. This threat will diminish Wednesday morning as winds start
to subside.

KSEA...Currently VFR conditions across the terminal with easterly
winds. Easterly flow will persist through the afternoon and evening.
Expect a large increase in wind speeds with sustained wind speeds of
20 to 30 kts into the evening and overnight hours. Maximum wind
gusts up to 45 kts are also possible. Rain will likely become
widespread beginning around 00Z and persist through around 07Z. A
stray shower or two is possible after 07Z. As previously mentioned,
there is the possibility for mountain wave activity that may impact
the terminal, however confidence remains low. Winds will eventually
begin to decrease around 11Z and southerly flow will gradually be
reinstated at the terminal.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong, robust area of low pressure (sub 960 mb),
will impact the coastal waters this afternoon into Wednesday. Key
points for the marine forecast are outlined below:

* Seas: Seas currently persist at 8 to 12 feet according to the most
  recent buoy observations this afternoon. Seas over the outer
  coastal waters may reach heights of 25 to 30 feet, with seas
  expecting to build to 20 to 24 ft closer to the Washington
  coastline. The highest seas (27 to 30 feet) are expected over the
  outer coastal water zones, generally between 30-60 NM.
  Elevated seas are possible along the Strait of Juan de Fuca where
  greater fetch combined with strong easterly winds over a 12-15
  hour period could potentially could generate seas of 7 to 10 feet.
  Uncertainty in wave height remains given the unusual easterly
  wind, but expect overall conditions in the central Strait to be
  choppy.

* Wind: Winds have been gusting to storm force (48 kt and greater)
  this afternoon across the coastal waters and portions of the
  Strait of Juan de Fuca. Winds are expected to peak this evening
  and gradually decrease through Wednesday. Winds associated with
  the storm warning call for gusts of 65 kt with sustained speeds of
  40 to 45 kt. There is the potential for gusts to even reach
  Hurricane Force (70 kts), but these winds once again will be in
  the outer coastal water zones (and also way offshore) and will
  likely be brief as the front crosses through the area. Gale
  Warnings are in effect and will continue for the Northern Inland
  Waters, Admiralty Inlet, and the Puget Sound and Hood Canal Waters.

* Grays Harbor Bar: Rough to severe bar conditions will develop
  tonight. Strong easterly winds will contribute to rough bar
  conditions, especially around the ebbs currents. With large waves
  along the immediate coast, winds from the east and ebbs will allow
  for waves to steepen. Conditions are likely to remain hazardous
  across the bar into Wednesday.

Winds and seas will slowly subside in the wake of this system on
Wednesday. Another low pressure system may track northward along the
coastal waters by Friday, bringing another round of gusty winds and
building seas to the region into the weekend.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The forecasts for the main part of the this
storm system keeps pushing it further south and is changing the
orientation of the flow pattern into the Olympics. It is looking
less likely that precipitation over the Olympics tonight into
Wednesday will push the Skokomish River above flood stage Wednesday.
But since flooding is still possible, the flood watch for Mason
County will continue and in fact was extended in time. There is some
indication that precipitation after the river peaks on Wednesday,
while less than tonight and Wednesday, will see much warmer
conditions that will melt a significant portion of the snow from
last night and tonight, adding to the runoff. That might be enough
to drive the skokomish above flood stage Friday instead, but that is
far from certain.

Elsewhere, no river flooding is expected. Lower snow levels in the
Cascades, as low as 2000 to 3000 ft during the heaviest
precipitation, will limit runoff and reduce any flooding chances for
rivers flowing off the Cascades. Precipitation for the remainder of
the period will come in bursts. This combined with snow levels
remaining relatively low will keep rivers in their banks. The
exception to this will be the Skokomish with the river remaining
near flood stage into the weekend.
