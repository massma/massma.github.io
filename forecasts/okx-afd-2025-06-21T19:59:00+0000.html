Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
359 PM EDT Sat Jun 21 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will become more established through the weekend.
A few disturbances will pass through this weekend. Weak low
pressure moves southeast from Nova Scotia into Western Atlantic
on Monday. Strong ridge of high pressure still based south and
west of the region on Monday. High pressure remains south and
west of the region Tuesday. A cold front moves near the area
Wednesday and weakens with multiple weak waves of low pressure
moving along it for the latter half of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SUNDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Quiet conditions continue through tonight with some fair weather
cumulus clouds through this evening. While no PoPs are in the
forecast a few CAMs have a pop-up shower this afternoon.

A developing SW flow this afternoon and tonight will advect moisture
back into the area. There is still quite bit of uncertainty with the
possible development of a convective MCS that rides over the
northern portion of the developing ridge. Some CAMs indicate that
this MCS that develops over southern Canada this afternoon may
quickly traverse through parts of the area sometime late tonight
into Sunday morning. At this time have opted not to forecast
anything more than a slight chance as the potential MCS continues to
show rapid weakening as it approaches the area. Best chance to see
any sort of precipitation would be for areas north, but once again,
confidence in the occurrence of this is much lower than normal at
this time frame.

Lows tonight will be in the 70s with dewpoints in the 60s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>* Extreme Heat Warning for much of the region from Sunday
  afternoon through 8 PM Tuesday including NYC.

* Heat Advisory is now in effect for Sunday and an Extreme Heat
  Watch on Monday and Tuesday remains, for portions of Long
  Island and coastal Middlesex and New London Counties.

Sunday morning, the development of the ridge will be well underway
with heights continuing to rise aloft and high pressure
strengthening to the south. There is the potential of some morning
cloud cover or showers from a decaying MCS mostly across our
northern zones, but otherwise skies will be mostly clear. Sunday is
expected to be the beginning of what may very well be a record
setting heatwave for some locations.

SW flow will continue to allow dew points to rise into the upper 60s
and lower 70s with temperatures climbing into the 90s for much of
the area. Some of the hottest spots near the NYC metro may approach
100 degrees. Heat index values will be generally 100-105 for much of
the area. For areas closer to the coast, heat index values of 95-100
will be expected.

Lows at night will not offer much relief as low temperatures will
only be in the 70s with more urban locations possibly not dropping
below 80.

Given the expected excessive heat, the Extreme Heat Watch that
was in effect for NYC has been upgraded to an Extreme Heat Warning
for Sunday through Tuesday. The highest heat index values will
occur each afternoon, but especially on Monday and Tuesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>* Extreme heat continues Monday and Tuesday for portions of the
 region

* Heat wave potentially breaks later in the week (Thursday
through Saturday) with more unsettled weather pattern taking
shape

Regarding extreme heat, the new forecast incorporates a blend of
MOS, NBM and the previous forecast for the max temperature forecast
and dewpoint forecast Monday. Used NBM for temperatures Tuesday and
thereafter.

The max temperature forecast for Monday used 40 percent NBM, 40
percent previous forecast and 20 percent MOS consensus. MOS did
shift several degrees lower compared to last run. Did not want to
make significant changes just based on suite of model runs that
being 12Z this morning. 12Z MOS model data did lower by several
degrees compared to previous run and in some locations more. That is
why MOS consensus was weighed less.

One significant trend Monday is that dewpoints rise. Synoptically,
low pressure passes well to the east of the area and with high
pressure to the south and west, a more southerly flow will be driven
into the local region. If low pressure does trend any stronger or
closer east of the area over the Atlantic, that would invoke a more
southeast flow as opposed to the south flow.

Models still indicate 850mb temperatures near 21 to 23 degrees C
with strong ridging at 500mb, well above 590 dm. Subsidence will
allow for dry conditions and mostly sunny sky conditions. Surface
temperatures will easily rise with diurnal heating as a result and
the southerly flow will provide more humid conditions. Max apparent
temperatures forecast 105 to 110 across portions of NYC, NE NJ,
Lower Hudson Valley and portions of Southern CT. Extreme heat
warning continues to cover this as well as areas that are close the
105 degree heat index mark.

Tuesday, 500mb slight decrease in height, but still prominent ridge
remains established across the region. 850mb temperatures Tuesday
still near 22 to 23 degrees C. Daytime troughing appears more
evident Tuesday, giving more of a westerly component. Pressure
gradient is not too strong so winds near 5-10 kt SW to W. More
daytime mixing expected but dewpoints still mid 60s to near 70 for
the region. Max apparent temperature forecast just slightly less
than the previous day. Across the extreme heat warning area, most
locations are around 105 degree heat index with some locations
slightly higher.

Outside the extreme heat warning, we have an extreme heat watch for
Nassau into Western Suffolk as well as Southeast CT along the coast.
105 degree heat index values are possible within this region but
most forecast values are in the mid 90s to around 100 range.

Wednesday marks a transitions time period where the heat wanes with
more height decreases at 500mb with 850mb temperatures more within
the 18 to 20 degree C range. Max apparent temperature range
Wednesday forecast Western Suffolk west through NE NJ and Lower
Hudson Valley and much of Southern CT, more in the 95 to 100 degree
C range. This forecast is a few days away and there is uncertainty
of a few degrees with temperature and dewpoints. This could very
well make the difference with heat indices as a result potentially
getting to 105 for much of the area as previous days. So, heat
headlines may need to get extended into Wednesday.

Otherwise, less ridging and the approach of a cold front Wednesday
which could very well stall out thereafter will present a more
unsettled weather pattern. Multiple model guidance indicates a
substantial cool down Thursday through Saturday, with temperatures
on average for highs more in the 80s. Chances for showers and
thunderstorm reappear in the forecast.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /20Z SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>VFR with high pressure in control.

SW-S 5-10 kt expected this afternoon. Along the coast, expect
the afternoon sea breeze to produce winds closer to 10-15 kt.
Winds become light and variable tonight. Winds on Sunday will be
from the SW. Can not rule out an isolated shower this
afternoon/evening.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

S-SE harbor breeze should hold just E of KEWR this afternoon, but
may make it in there and at KTEB toward 00Z Sunday.

.OUTLOOK FOR 18Z SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...

Sunday afternoon: VFR. Chance of an isolated shower or
thunderstorm in the afternoon. WSW-SW winds G15-20kt in the
afternoon.

Monday and Tuesday: VFR.

Wednesday: Chance of showers/tstms in the afternoon/evening mainly
for KHPN/KSWF.

Thursday: Chance of showers/tstms mainly in the
afternoon/evening.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Below SCA conditions expected through Sunday night with some
occasional 5 feet seas Sunday afternoon/evening. Sub-SCA
conditions forecast Monday through Thursday night.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
There are no hydrologic concerns through the rest of the
forecast period with dry conditions prevailing.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
Low risk for rip currents for all ocean beaches with a
diminished swell and lower offshore wave heights. With an
increase in swell and wave heights out east look for a moderate
risk on Sunday for Nassau and Suffolk beaches, with a lower
risk for Brooklyn and Queens.
