Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
812 AM PDT Tue Aug 20 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Cool and showery conditions today with a low pressure
system moving inland. Isolated thunderstorms are possible from
west to east as this system moves through. A stronger system
brings additional moisture, thunderstorm chances, and cool
temperatures later in the week. Showers continue into the weekend
with a shift to drier and slightly warmer conditions early next
week.

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Round one of precipitation is progressing from the
Puget Sound lowlands into the Cascade this morning while round two
is making its way across the Pacific coast associated with the
center of the upper level low. This second round is expected to
move across the Puget Sound lowlands mid-day through the afternoon
and bring a higher chance of lightning along with it. Current
lightning probabilities are generally in the 20-30% range today as
a result of a broad area of 500+ J/kg SBCAPE. However, sounding
and mesoscale analysis shows that storms that form will generally
be weak and moving at 10-20 mph resulting in brief heavy rain,
lightning, small hail, and erratic winds being the main threats.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Latest NWS radar imagery
depicts several bands of precipitation spreading onshore across
the region, rotating broadly around the parent low that has
remained offshore for the last day or so. Guidance continues to
suggest this low will finally push onshore through the day, with
the southerly flow bringing moisture and the colder air aloft
steepening lapse rates. This will maintain plenty of showers and
perhaps a few isolated thunderstorms as the low tracks eastward
today. The main threats will be brief downpours, lightning, and
small hail, along with gusty winds. As the colder air moves in
behind the front, expect temperatures to largely trend some 5 to
10 degrees cooler than yesterday. The next low dropping from the
Gulf of Alaska will quickly slide down the Pacific coast from
near southern Vancouver Island Wednesday to the Oregon/California
border by late Thursday. Additional showers and isolated thunderstorms
remain possible as this system moves by, and temperatures will
remain cooler than normal.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Expect the low well to the
south to slide eastward into the Great Basin, providing for some
slightly rising heights over the region. However, a few embedded
disturbances likely provide the focus for more rain at times into
the first half of the weekend. Ensemble guidance then slightly
favors a shift back to a warmer and drier pattern for the early
portions of next week. However, still plenty of variability in
potential outcomes and confidence in the specifics remains lower
for the weekend and beyond at this point.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mainly VFR to MVFR in scattered showers. An upper level
low will continue to push inland today, allowing for
south/southwesterly flow aloft to become more westerly by this
evening. Expect showers to continue pushing inland through the
morning and to persist through the day. Isolated thunderstorms will
also be possible throughout the day, however confidence at this time
is too low to include in the TAFs. Ceilings generally VFR across the
interior this morning, with MVFR along the coast in showers. Winds
primarily S/SW at 5-10 kt.

KSEA...VFR with showers persisting within the vicinity of the
terminal through the day and a low chance of isolated thunderstorms
this afternoon. Winds will generally persist from the S/SW at 5-10
kt and may be gusty in showers. 14/15<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...Low pressure offshore will gradually weaken today and
push inland. Winds 10-20 kt over the coastal waters will
gradually ease through the day today. Isolated thunderstorms will
be possible throughout the day today and could bring gusty winds
and low visibilities to portions of the area waters at times.
Another low will drop down into the region mid to late week and
bring a weak front to the coastal waters. Additional systems will
move into the area waters over the weekend, bringing increased
onshore flow to the area and the potential for stronger westerly
pushes through the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Wave heights will
generally range between 3-6 ft over the next several days. 14
