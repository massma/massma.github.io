Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
211 PM PST Sat Nov 30 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will continue to amplify into western
Washington over the weekend and into early next week, allowing
for mostly dry conditions and night and morning fog. The high
pressure ridge will begin to weaken towards the middle of next
week, introducing the next chance for widespread precipitation
across the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Dry but cool conditions
prevail for much of western WA. There is some very light warm
frontal precip near the Canadian border tonight into Sunday but
total amounts are only a trace to a hundredth (if anything).
Patchy low clouds and fog near the sound overnight with lows in
the 30s (and freezing temps around the south sound).

High pressure continues through Tuesday for more dry and stable
conditions. Overall little day-to-day variation in the weather
conditions. 33

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Rain starts to undercut
the ridge past midweek with threats of light precipitation, as
seen in the ensemble members. The air mass will be a little warmer
with lows in the 40s and highs reaching the 50s by Friday. A
trough may kick the ridge inland next weekend with a more
organized frontal system moving in. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The same ridge pattern continues over Western Washington
this afternoon with west to northwest flow aloft. Most terminals are
reporting VFR this afternoon, though a couple pockets of MVFR
ceilings remain west of Puget Sound that will lift up to VFR through
the afternoon/evening. As the mid and high level moisture dries out
going into tonight, the clouds at these levels will clear out,
leading to increasing chances of IFR/LIFR stratus or fog tonight
into Sunday morning. The highest chances for fog will be South Puget
Sound/Olympics/Cascades/South Interior areas, with coverage
increasing towards sunrise, then beginning to dissipate as the sun
rises. Winds will remain variable to light out of the north today

KSEA...VFR this afternoon with scattered clouds around 8-10,000 feet
and high clouds to the west. Otherwise there will be some more
clearing of the cloud coverage going into tonight, which will
increase the chances for low clouds/fog in the morning. NBM gives a
50% chance of MVFR conditions (30% for IFR and 20% for LIFR). The
most likely case is for the lower CIGs/VIS to approach from the
south around 12-15Z, with at least low stratus making it into the
terminal early Sunday morning before scattering out mid to late
morning. Light north/northeast winds at around 5 kt this afternoon
will become light/variable this evening, before picking up at the
same speed/direction Sunday morning.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure remains over the waters into next week with
the next best chance of a disturbance towards midweek. There will be
chances of low stratus or fog over some of the waters Sunday and
Monday morning (best chances for waters are interior zones) that
will begin to form after dusk, and dissipate as the sun rises. Winds
will remain light for all waters at or less than 5 to 10 kt (chance
this increases over the coastal waters Thursday with the approaching
system up to 20 kt). The seas will build this weekend up to 6 to 8
feet, decrease back to 4 to 6 feet Monday through mid week, then
build back up to 6 to 8 feet towards the end of the week.
