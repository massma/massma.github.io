Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
146 PM EDT Tue Oct 3 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure over the region through Thursday will slowly
weaken beginning Thursday night, and give way to an approaching
frontal system on Friday. The associated cold front will pass
through late Saturday into Saturday night. High pressure will
then likely build from the south and west Sunday into Monday.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
Forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments to reflect
current observations and trends into the early afternoon.
Adjusted high temperatures a little.

Sfc high pressure and a building upper ridge will lead to warm
conditions throughout today. Sided with warmer GFS/ECMWF MOS
numbers which worked fairly well for yesterday`s temps, so
expect highs in the mid 80s in urban NE NJ, and upper 70s/lower
80s most elsewhere, and mid 70s only across the forks of Long
Island and the immediate shoreline of SE CT. Temps at a few
sites may approach or exceed daily record highs: see the Climate
section for details.

Mostly clear skies and light winds should lead to excellent
radiational cooling conditions once again tonight, with lows
from the mid 60s invof NYC to the 50s inland and across eastern
Long Island. With higher dewpoints advecting into the area
expect fog development especially after midnight, and the fog
could become dense in spots late especially NW of NYC.

&&

.SHORT TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
On Wed the low level flow should turn onshore as the sfc high
begins to move east, but do not think this will have much impact
on high temps, with mid 80s once again in NE NJ and lower 80s
most elsewhere. A second day of light onshore flow, perhaps
more in the way of cloud cover, and falling heights aloft as the
high move east should have more impact on temps on Thu, but it
should still be on the warm side, with highs mostly in the
mid/upper 70s.

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
Heights aloft continue to lower Thursday night as the high
amplitude ridge axis shifts farther east, along with surface
high pressure, and an upper level trough approaches. The trough
becomes negatively tilted and closes off, with an upper level
low expected to linger over the northeast thereafter through the
forecast period. This will bring a period of below normal
temperatures for the second half of the weekend through at least
the start of next week.

As the upper level trough approaches, an associated surface low
will track well to our north and west. This low will drag a
cold front through the area late Saturday into Saturday night,
with the potential for a wave of low pressure to form along the
front over or near our area. The placement of this low will
affect rainfall totals, but right now the system overall
continues to look progressive. The NBM remains mostly unchanged
from 24 hours ago with the 25-35% chance of seeing 1 inch of
rain over the 24 hour period ending 00z Sunday. The GFS also
continues to show pwats increase to about 1.75 inches ahead of
the cold front on Saturday. Per SPC Sounding Climatology Page
this is well over the 90% moving average at KOKX for 10/07 12Z.
Rain chances increase Friday afternoon and become likely late
Friday night through Saturday. Rain then tapers off early
Sunday, with a mostly dry Sunday expected. Lingering light
showers are possible for the next several days with the
lingering upper level low, mainly north and west of NYC.

This cold front will bring the coolest air we have seen in
several months. Highs Sunday and Monday will be in the mid 50s
to lower 60s, and lows each of those nights will range from the
lower 40s to lower 50s.

.AVIATION /18Z TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pres builds over the region tngt, and offshore on Wed.

Light winds today, mainly sw, although sea breeze flow expected
near the coasts. Winds become light and vrb tngt, then out of
the se on Wed.

Mainly VFR thru the TAF period. Some fog expected tngt,
especially inland arpts. Patchy fog included for TEB/HPN/SWF
attm.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Fog is expected to only impact TEB attm. Very low chance of vis
restrictions elsewhere, although EWR would be the next most
likely.

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...

Rest of Wednesday...VFR.

Wednesday night...MVFR or lower in fog.

Thursday...VFR.

Friday...MVFR or lower possible. Rain possible by aftn.

Saturday...MVFR or lower with rain.

Sunday...VFR.

.MARINE...
Sub SCA conds on the waters this AM with a 3-ft ESE swell on the
ocean waters. Conds should remain below SCA thresholds through
Thu with high pressure remaining in control, and continuing
ocean swell. The pressure gradient will remain relatively weak.

With increasing SE flow ahead of a cold front on Fri, ocean seas
should build to around 5 ft by Fri night. Winds and gusts
increase with an approaching cold front Sat into Sat night, and
ocean gusts may reach 25 kt behind the front Sat night. Ocean
seas will also build Saturday into Saturday night as long period
swells from distant Tropical Storm Philippe move into the
waters. Refer to the National Hurricane Center,
https:/www.nhc.noaa.gov for official forecasts on Philippe.
