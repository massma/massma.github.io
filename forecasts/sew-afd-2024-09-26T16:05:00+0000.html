Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
905 AM PDT Thu Sep 26 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A brief lull in activity before another system moves
into the region this evening into Friday. This will bring another
round of rain and gusty winds. Conditions then expected to dry out
over the weekend. A series of weaker systems may move into the area
early next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>More rain and wind
impacting the region tonight into Friday as highlighted below. The
current forecast remains on track. 33

Previous discussion...Extremely weak ridging currently in place
over W WA may allow for some portions of the area to see partly to
mostly sunny skies today in advance of the next incoming
front...although timing works out that the coast will likely start
to see clouds from this system start to move in right at or just
a little after sunrise. From this point, clouds increase steadily
throughout the day before main precip expected to start up by
early afternoon for the coast, early evening for points east of
the Olympics. Winds will be of concern for some locations as the
front passes through, as portions of western Whatcom and Skagit
counties as well as the San Juans may see gusts late this evening
and throughout the overnight hours. Speeds are not expected to
enter into headline criteria for the most part, even though
isolated gusts right up to the low end of Wind Advisory criteria
may occur. In such a borderline instance, while no headlines will
go out with morning forecast, it is important to note that this
appears to be the first wind event for W WA this autumn season. As
such, isolated downed tree branches or power outages may be
possible. The remainder of the CWA may also see occasional
breeziness, but nothing impactful is expected.

Lingering showers possible Friday morning...but conditions will dry
throughout the day as the area falls under the influence of the
backside of a building broad ridge largely centered over the
Rockies. This feature along with a lack of any real organized
pattern over the Pacific should keep the area dry for the remainder
of the near term.

Temperatures will remain mild with daytime highs generally in the
lower to mid 60s throughout the period.

18

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...A more convincing upper level
ridge shifting eastward through the area will allow dry conditions
to at least extend into Monday. Deterministic models having some
difficulty agreeing on system for Tuesday when it comes to timing
and southern extent. Ensembles are not having the best time with it
either although amongst the varying solutions at least a pattern
emerges where any precip will have a better likelihood of staying
north of Seattle. Both deterministic and ensemble solutions favor an
upper level ridge returning at some point during Wednesday bringing
a return to dry conditions into Thursday. NBM in forecast for both
Tuesday and Wednesday displays the varying solutions with chance
PoPs, reflecting more the uncertainty than the actual expected
chance of rain from the weather feature itself.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>This morning: mix of low clouds and fog continue to
affect portions of the Kitsap Peninsula, down into the Chehalis
Valley. A few terminals in these areas (KPWT down to KCLS) continue
to show fog down to a half or a quarter of a mile at times. A break
in shower activity this morning (but in between cold fronts) led to
some breaks in the cloud coverage (though it remains solidly broken
to overcast in most areas at VFR or MVFR in areas not affected by
fog). The next cold front will sweep through the region later today
into Friday. Showers are expected to arrive inland along the coast
after 00Z this afternoon, and continue to spread inland through
tonight. Rainfall rates are not expected to be as intense as the
previous front, but a few heavier showers may reduce visibilities
down to 2-3 miles at times. The main impact from this front will be
widespread gusty southwest winds. Terminals closest to the waters
(coastal and inland waterways) will see local gusts up to 35 kt.
CIGs will lower into MVFR Friday morning (possibly IFR in the
Cascades and Southwest Interior), before mostly clearing out later
in the day. Post front, the winds will switch to the north 4 to 8 kt
early Friday afternoon.

KSEA...Mix of MVFR/VFR ceilings will transition to VFR at or just
after 18Z this morning. Winds will pick up out of the southwest,
gusting to or exceeding 25 kt by 02Z through 11Z later today. Rain
showers will work their way back over the terminal. The rainfall
rates will be less than yesterday, but still a chance that a heavier
shower reduces visibilities down to 2-3 miles. MVFR CIGs will return
early Friday morning, and remain through early Friday afternoon
before clearing. A shift in winds to the north is expected after 14-
15Z Friday afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Winds have temporarily eased in between frontal systems,
but we`ll again see an increase in southerly winds over the waters
this morning as a low intensifies as it moves toward Haida Gwaii
through the day today. This will bring gales across portions of the
coastal waters - especially across the northern and outer zones - as
well as the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca, northern inland waters,
and Admiralty Inlet as it approaches. Elsewhere, expect to see
winds solidly into the small craft range today and tonight with the
potential for some isolated stronger gusts immediately ahead of the
front. Meanwhile, seas will remain around 10 ft over the coastal
waters and build again with the next front passing. This will brings
seas into the 13 to 16 ft range over the coastal waters. Behind the
front, expect to see westerly winds through the Strait of Juan de
Fuca with lingering SCA conditions expected into Friday. Northerly
winds also redevelop over the coastal waters into the weekend, with
the potential to again reach advisory strength. Seas will also
remain above 10 ft into early Saturday morning.  Expect another
break in the active weather early next week, but another system may
bring building seas again by midweek. Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
