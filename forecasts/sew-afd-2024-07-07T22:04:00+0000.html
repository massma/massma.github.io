Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
304 PM PDT Sun Jul 7 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Hot and dry conditions will persist under a strong
upper level ridge through the first half of the week. Some relief
is expected around midweek as the ridge moves eastward and weakens.
However, above normal temperatures and no precipitation will remain.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Yet another day of very
hot temperatures is well underway across Western Washington. At
this hour, many locations have climbed into the 80s along the
coast and a mix of 80s and lower 90s through the region. We may
again see a few record high temperatures for the date fall, with
Hoquiam already toppled today. Not much in the way of significant
changes in store with high pressure over the region and the
thermal low pressure building up over the region into Monday
before pushing eastward Tuesday. This will maintain very hot
temperatures through the early part of next week, with areas of
Moderate (orange) to Major (red) HeatRisk expected through the
interior portions of western Washington. Overnight lows will also
remain in the lower 60s for areas inland, making for slow relief
from the very hot daytime highs.

Still expect Monday and Tuesday to be the warmest days of the
week for most with the upper ridge axis moving eastward over the
region. This will bring some light onshore influence back to the
immediate coast into the afternoon, but little help for the
interior with the thermal low pressure building overhead and
cutting off much in the way of surface wind. Additionally, expect
very warm nights in the mountains as the subsidence inversion
strengthens. Have extended the heat advisory for the coast through
Tuesday morning. While temperatures along the immediate coast will
begin to moderate and see more significant overnight relief, there
remains some question of how far inland the marine influence will
be able to push. As a result, extended this to cover through the
Monday night period after one more fairly warm day away from the
coastline. Tuesday will be notably cooler for the coastal areas
and into the Olympics as onshore flow begins to return. Areas as
far as Chehalis, Olympia, and Shelton may see some moderation by
Wednesday morning. This will be quite slow to push further into
the interior with Wednesday remaining quite warm through the Puget
Sound region (especially after another very warm night). This may
require some extension of the heat advisory for areas from
Seattle and east into the Cascade valleys.

One other note with the stronger onshore flow as it arrives late
Wednesday: forecast guidance has trended notably stronger with
some gusty winds as the trough pushes east. This will be most
notable along the coastal areas, but will need to monitor the
potential for gusty winds ahead of the more humid air, especially
as it relates to fire weather concerns.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Still some minor
differences emerging in the timing of the ridge weakening as a
weak shortwave moves across the region, but ensemble guidance
remains in fairly strong agreement that it will be enough to
shift the pattern back down from the extremely hot and dry pattern
to one that is probably better described as fairly warm.
Increasing onshore flow should bring a return of higher daytime
humidities with good overnight recoveries, and high temperatures
that are only climbing into the 80s. While this is some 10-ish
degrees cooler than where we`ll be in the preceding days, this
will be a continuation of above normal temperatures through the
second half of the week with still no significant prospects for
precipitation in sight for the local area. Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow aloft continues as high pressure
amplifies over the west. VFR will persist once again for most area
terminals, with the exception being KHQM for brief IFR/LIFR
conditions as a weak marine push develops around 09z-13z.
N/NE winds through the evening generally staying between 5 to 10
kts.

KSEA...VFR conditions through the TAF period. N/NE 4 to 8 knots
this evening through the overnight.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure remains situated offshore, with a thermal
trough along the west coast and north/northwesterly winds over the
coastal waters. Generally benign marine conditions will persist
through the first half of the week.

A surface front looks to sweep over the coastal waters Wednesday
night into Thursday for increased onshore flow and for stronger
pushes down the Strait of Juan De Fuca. Winds look to become
elevated over the coastal waters and through the Strait through
the end of the week.

Coastal seas 4 to 6 feet through the first half of the week,
gradually increasing to 6 to 8 feet by the end of the week.

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>As expected, strong high pressure is continuing
to bring very warm and dry conditions to the region. With the
additional factor of instability, the red flag warning for the
Cascades zones (658 and 659) will remain unchanged. Elsewhere, the
primary concern for the lower elevations and foothills south and
east of Puget Sound will be the continued critical afternoon
relative humidity values. For these zones, there`s at least one
factor (fuel readiness, instability or winds) that remains
lacking, but given the continued trends there remains the
potential for needing a Red Flag Warning for additional zones by
Tuesday. Some onshore flow will bring somewhat higher humidities
for the coastal and Olympics zones Monday, but it could be at late
as Wednesday before portions of the Cascades see notable
improvement.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
