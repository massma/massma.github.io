.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>One more mild and dry day today before a low pressure
system moves through Friday and Saturday, which will bring rain
showers. High-elevation mountain snow is expected above 5000 ft.
Warm and dry conditions return early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mid-level stratus remains
in place but will begin to scatter out later this morning over
much of the Cascades and interior western Washington, with low
stratus attempting to start to form along the coast. Temperatures
this morning are in the mid 40s to low 50s. Similar to yesterday,
expecting partly cloudy skies with temperatures topping out in
the mid to upper 60s, close to 70.

Clouds will increase tonight as a broad surface low
pressure system, supported by a deep upper level low, moves into
the area from the northwest. Showers will begin along the coast
early Friday morning, then spreading over the entire area during
the day Friday into Saturday. With the upper level low directly
overhead, the airmass will be slightly unstable with a slight
chance for a few low-topped afternoon thunderstorms across
southwest Washington. The primary threats will be localized
downpours, lightning, and perhaps some small hail or graupel.
Through Saturday, QPF amounts will range in the quarter to half
inch of rain across the lowlands with up to an inch or more over
the mountains. Snow levels will lower Friday and Friday night to
around 5000 ft. A few tenths of an inch of accumulating snow may
be possible at higher-elevation passes/recreational areas above
5000 ft (Paradise, Highway 20, etc.) with a few inches of snow
possible over the higher peaks.

High temperatures Friday and Saturday will be well below normal--in
the upper 50s to low 60s. Lows will be in the mid 40s to low 50s.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Showers will lighten up
and taper off through the day on Sunday, lingering mostly over the
Cascades and the upper level low shifts to the southeast. Sunday
will start the return to a warming and drying trend as ridging
begins to nose in Monday into Tuesday and 500 mb heights rise back
above 570 dm. Currently, Tuesday looks to be the warmest day with
highs in the mid 70s to low 80s. Highs along the coast in the mid
60s with onshore flow. The pattern begins to look less clear
beginning Wednesday with the potential for some shortwaves to move
over the area as another large upper level low spins off the
British Columbia coast. This may bring some chances for some light
precipitation across the area, which is reflected in the NBM PoPs
Wednesday into Thursday, but certainly not something to hold onto
as plenty of ensemble members keep ridging in place, leaving
western Washington mostly dry.
