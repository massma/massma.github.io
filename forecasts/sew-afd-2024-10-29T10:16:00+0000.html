Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
316 AM PDT Tue Oct 29 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showers lingering over the Cascades today, with weak
high pressure aloft. A stronger frontal system will move through
Wednesday for breezy winds, lowland rain, and mountain snow.
Unsettled weather will continue late week with continued cooler
temperatures.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showers linger early this
morning, mainly from residual convergence activity over the
central Cascades, but a few showers continue elsewhere with low
level moisture. Generally drier conditions expected for the
lowlands today with weak high pressure later this afternoon, but a
few showers will linger. There may also be a few sunbreaks today,
depending on location, especially this afternoon. Otherwise,
highs will peak in the low to mid 50s.

The next frontal system will approach Western Washington later
tonight, and move across the area on Wednesday. Southeasterly
winds will increase ahead of the front, particularly Wednesday
morning, for the coast, as well as areas adjacent to Admiralty
Inlet and San Juan Islands. At this time, wind gusts are forecast
to range 25 to 40 MPH for these aforementioned areas, with
approximately a 30 to 60% chance of 45 MPH gusts (or greater)
along the north coast, as well as near San Juan Islands. Winds
will slowly taper, but remain elevated, Wednesday afternoon.
Lowland rain will also increase on Wednesday with the frontal
passage. In addition, there remains a slight chance for
thunderstorms along the Olympic Peninsula and coast on Wednesday.

Snow levels Wednesday into Thursday will range 3000 to 4000 feet,
with periods of mountain snow. The initial timeframe of steadier
snowfall will be later Wednesday with the front, with a few inches
of snow possible for Stevens Pass and White Pass, and trace
amounts at Snoqualmie Pass into Wednesday night. Some uncertainty
exists as to the extent of precipitation on Thursday, but
continued troughing suggests further unsettled conditions and
showers over Western Washington. This would allow for additional,
light snowfall accumulation over the mountains. At this time, NBM
probabilities range 40-50% chance of 6" of snow at Stevens Pass
during a 48 hour period between 0500 Wednesday to 0500 Friday,
with slightly higher probabilities for White Pass given heavier
precipitation further south. Otherwise, highs will remain slightly
below average in the low 50s.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Broad troughing will continue
to be situated across the Pacific Northwest on Friday for likely
unsettled weather. There remains uncertainty in ensemble guidance
regarding the orientation of the trough, and thus the location of
heaviest precipitation late week. The multi-model ensemble as
shown on WPC Clusters keeps the heavier QPF over Oregon and
southern Washington on Friday, with lesser amounts farther
northwards across Western Washington. CMC ensembles are a bit more
of an outlier, similar to the deterministic run, in a more
consolidated upper low, with a further north solution of heavier
QPF. The main impact from this would be continued mountain
snowfall in varying intensity. Despite the uncertainty, shower
chances remain Friday into Friday night. NBM suggests
precipitation chances lessen, but remain Saturday into Sunday.
However, wouldn`t be surprised in a period of drier weather over
the weekend given some ridging building offshore on ensembles.
Another system may begin to impact the area Monday into next week.
Highs during this period near to slightly below normal. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northerly flow aloft today as an upper-ridge builds
overhead. The flow will later turn southwesterly tonight as a trough
positions offshore. A mix of VFR/MVFR currently but MVFR cigs are
expected to become more widespread as the morning progress. VFR
conditions will then return areawide by the afternoon (18-20z).
Mostly VFR tonight into early Wednesday morning as mid-high level
clouds increase ahead of a stout frontal system.

KSEA...Mostly MVFR cigs in the forecast for this morning before a
return to VFR around midday (18-19z). Southerly winds throughout the
morning, becoming southwesterly in the afternoon then backing
towards the southwest tonight. Winds are to remain around 4 to 6 kt
generally.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A brief, and weak surface high will reside over area
waters today. Relatively calm seas are expected as the SCA over the
coastal waters will be allowed to expire. However, a stout sub 980mb
surface low is developing over the Gulf of Alaska and is forecast to
fill and track towards the offshore waters Tuesday night - Wednesday
morning. Active conditions are favored to return as strong southerly
winds increase. The current Gale Watch over the coastal waters will
likely upgrade to a Gale Warning as a 70-90% probability of gale
force winds remain. A lesser chance but still significant (40-50%)
of gale force winds exists over the East Strait for the same period.
Along with gales, SCA are becoming more probable as well,
particularly for the Northern Inland waters and Admiralty Inlet but
can`t rule out the potential for neighboring zones. The surface low
will track southeastward across the offshore waters Wednesday night
into Thursday. Then, surface ridging will rebuild over the waters
towards the weekend.

Coastal seas will decrease to 6-8 ft today but rise rapidly and
hazardously to 10-12 ft Tuesday night into Wednesday and likely
remain well-above 10 ft into early Friday.
