Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
227 PM PDT Mon Aug 26 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A trough moving over western Washington will bring
showers and cooler temperatures to start the week. High pressure
will build into the region mid-week, allowing conditions to dry
out and warm out through the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A trough will continue to
dig into the Pacific Northwest today, ushering in clouds and
shower activity with a few embedded lightning strikes. The front
will push a few rounds of of showers across the region through the
evening with most shower activity west of the Cascades tapering
off after midnight. Ensembles favor the highest chance of
lightning activity with this system over the Olympics and North
Cascades (10% to 15% probability). Breezy winds will develop
tonight as the front passes through, especially through the Strait
of Juan de Fuca and across the lowlands towards the Canada
border. High resolution models also show potential for convergence
zone shower activity developing east of the Puget Sound early
Tuesday morning, though the exact timing and placement is
uncertain. Precipitation across western Washington will end by
Tuesday afternoon as cool northwest flow develops aloft. Rainfall
accumulations will generally be light for the lowlands with
totals of less than a tenth of an inch, while the Cascades will
see totals approaching an inch through the morning hours.
Despite clearing skies on Tuesday, temperatures will top out
roughly 10 degrees below normal for the end of August with highs
in the 60s across the lowlands. Northerly flow at the surface will
cool things down even more heading into Wednesday morning, with
lows bottoming out in the mid 40s to mid 50s, which would be the
coolest morning in Seattle in over 2 months.

Upper level ridging will build into western Washington on
Wednesday and Thursday, allowing temperatures to slowly rebound
and conditions to dry out. High pressure will maintain mostly
clear skies as highs return to near normal in the mid to upper
70s across the lowlands by Thursday.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Ensembles show good agreement
over the extended forecast, favoring above-normal temperatures and
dry conditions across western Washington as high pressure builds
over the western US. Low level flow will turn offshore late
Thursday into Friday as a thermally induced surface trough
develops along the Pacific coast, allowing for continued warming
across western Washington and a return of summer- like
temperatures just in time for the holiday weekend. Warming will
continue into Saturday as a weak trough develops to the south
offshore. Forecast models are in good agreement over this feature,
but uncertainty still remains over the intensity and placement of
this low pressure system. Upper and mid level moisture will
likely increase as a result towards the end of the weekend, which
may lower temperatures and allow for isolated shower and thunder
activity to form over higher terrain, but confidence is low at
this time.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft as a upper level trough moves
over the region this afternoon. Current VFR conditions across all
area terminals will gradually lower to MVFR, likely around 04z-08z
as light rain showers also move through the region. MVFR will
likely develop at coastal terminals around 00z-03z, then
gradually lower through the interior into the evening and
overnight period. Brief stints of IFR cannot be ruled out
especially at lower prone terminals, or in heavier showers. S/SW
winds 5 to 10 kts this afternoon will increase to around 10 to 15
kts, with the potential of gusts around 20 kts.

KSEA...Mid and high level clouds will continue to increase this
afternoon with rain moving through the area later this evening.
VFR conditions currently this afternoon, with gradually lowering
of ceilings to MVFR, likely around 06z-09z. MVFR will linger
through Tuesday morning before rebounding back to VFR by early
afternoon. S/SW winds this afternoon around 5 to 10 knots will
increase to around 8 to 12 knots around 08z, with possible gusts
up to 20 kts.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system will sweep over the coastal waters
through this evening and into tonight. Strong post-frontal
northwest winds will push across the coastal waters, resulting in
small craft advisories over all of the coastal water zones. Along
with post frontal winds, onshore flow will increase through the
Strait of Juan De Fuca for small craft advisory westerlies this
evening. Latest guidance continues to indicate brief gusts
potentially up to Gale Force in the East Entrance Tuesday morning
(30 to 40%).

Coastal seas 3 to 5 feet this afternoon building upwards to around
7 to 8 feet this evening. Combined with gusty northwest winds,
seas will likely become choppy, especially over the outer coastal
waters.

High pressure will begin to rebuild offshore with lower pressure
inland, resulting in a more typical summerlike pattern for the
rest of the week, with diurnally driven onshore flow.
