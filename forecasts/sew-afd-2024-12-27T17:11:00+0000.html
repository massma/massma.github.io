Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
911 AM PST Fri Dec 27 2024

.UPDATE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak surface low pushing across the area this morning will
continue to produce some low elevation rain and mountain snow.
Winter weather advisories remain posted across the Cascades today
with several more inches of snow at pass level this morning,
followed by more with the next system. There will be a lull by
around noontime and this afternoon as the low exits the area.
However the next system will not be far behind as more rain pushes
on the coast by the evening hours. The low pressure system will
be a little stronger tonight but remain offshore. The latest
guidance does indicate winds may be somewhat stronger than the
current forecast but mean probabilities show them remaining below
advisory level.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Western Washington will remain in an active weather pattern the
next few days, however the overall level of impacts will not
be significant. A continued parade of low pressure systems across
the next several days will keep rain chances high, but most of
the individual systems look excessively strong. A series of mid
level troughs will cross the region with temperatures tumbling to
near normal values by early this coming week. There is the
suggestion of increased ridging by mid-week, so temperatures
should warm to above normal by New Year`s day and into the start
of 2025. Snow will remain confined to the mountains with no
lowland threats on the horizon.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A low pressure system to the southwest will slowly drag
an occluded front over Western Washington today. This will turn the
southwesterly flow to westerly once the front passes through by
later today. Rain showers are ongoing with this front approaching,
and these will bring visibilities down to just under 6 SM passing
through Puget Sound. Lower VIS down to 2 SM has been observed in the
South Interior (east of Olympia/Chehalis corridor up to Tacoma),
primarily due to mist being brought in from the warm sector to the
southeast. The ceilings and visibilities will gradually lower this
morning into the afternoon (from south to north) as the fronts move
north. The lowest VIS/CIGs will be in the South Interior/far South
Puget Sound areas today.

Another round of rain showers is expected late this afternoon into
tonight/tomorrow morning (more scattered in coverage). Winds will
begin to pick up out of the southwest with this second round, with
gusts approaching 20 to 25 kt for most areas (through Saturday
afternoon) Little change is expected with CIGs/VIS going into
Saturday morning (ceilings will remain MVFR, with VIS improving by
late Saturday morning).

KSEA...Showers continue over the terminal this morning with the
first round. Visibilities will gradually lower this morning down to
around 5 miles (with ceilings dropping to around 1,000 to 1,500 feet
this afternoon). Improvements to around/above 6 miles and 2,000 to
2,500 feet are expected later this evening into tonight as another
round of rain arrives by around 00Z (lasting through Saturday
morning with isolated to scattered coverage). Gusty southwest winds
will pick up around the same time, peaking Saturday morning
(sustained winds at 10 to 15 kt with gusts to 25 kt).

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Conditions nowhere near as active as past 24 hours,
however still active enough to warrant some lingering headlines.
Seas remain well above 10 ft, thus keeping SCAs up over the coastal
waters. Winds will pick up there during the day though...adding
depth to the headline. With this headline persisting, so will the
rough bar for Grays Harbor. While SCA for the East Strait will be
allowed to expire early this morning, winds will pick up again this
evening, warranting a second headline. With more systems expected
through Monday, there remains the potential for additional headlines.

Seas 14 to 16 ft will begin to increase to 17 to 19 ft this evening
in advance of the next system before finally establishing a solid
downward trend starting Saturday evening, reaching 8-10 ft by Monday
morning.

.HYDROLOGY...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>System today not creating hydrologically significant precipitation.
Feature tonight into Saturday producing 1 to 2 inches of rain
over the south slopes of the OLympics. This will keep the
Skokomish River above flood stage through the weekend. Other
rivers in Southwest Washington will also be on the rise. While the
current hydrographs have the lower reaches of the Chehalis
cresting below flood stage over the weekend the crest values are
still only a few inches from flood stage. Break in the rain Monday
and Tuesday will allow all the rivers to relax in Western
Washington. The Skokomish could drop below flood stage for a brief
time before going back over flood stage with the rainfall
Wednesday and Thursday. Three to five inches of rain possible
along the south slopes of the Olympics Wednesday and Thursday will
put rivers flowing off the Olympics and the rivers in Southwest
Washington under pressure again late next week. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.PREV DISCUSSION... <span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>/issued 332 AM PST Fri Dec 27 2024/


SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Satellite imagery shows
weather system over Western Washington early this morning. Back
edge of the system is approaching the coast at 11z/3 am. Rain
associated with the system being reported along the coast and
from about King County southward in the interior. Temperatures are
in the lower to mid 40s.

Negatively tilted system moving through Western Washington this
morning. Rain spreading a little further north as the system
moves through but might not get as far north as Whatcom county.
Satellite imagery indicating no cold air behind the system
keeping post frontal showers at a minimum this afternoon. Highs
today near 50.

Leading edge of next system already approaching 130W and being
pushed along by a 150 knot westerly jet. This system will move
into Western Washington Saturday with rain out ahead of the
system spreading over the area this evening. Snow levels hovering
around 3500-4000 feet. Winter weather advisory in effect for the
Cascades tonight and Saturday for 3500 feet and above. There is a
chance Mount Rainier could get another 2 feet of snow with
another foot to maybe a foot and a half elsewhere between tonight
and late Saturday afternoon. Easterly surface winds will keep
temperatures cold enough in Snoqualmie Pass ( 3000 feet ) for snow
there as well tonight. Winds at Snoqualmie Pass turning westerly
Saturday which will warm the temperatures up just enough to bring
about an end to the snow in the pass.

After another short break Saturday evening the next system arrives
later Saturday night into Sunday. This feature aimed mostly into
Western Oregon with Western Washington on the northern edge. This
system is another juicy one with IVT values even on the northern
portion of the system around 500 kg m-1 s-1 for another round of
rain and mountain snow for the area. For those traveling through
the passes Sunday another winter weather advisory is likely so
prepare for winter driving conditions.

LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Models in good agreement
that the next system in the series Monday will fall weaken and
move northeast before it gets to Western Washington. Will have just
a chance of showers in the forecast. Possible atmospheric river
setting up offshore Tuesday. 00z models have a wave developing on
the backside of the front which will slow the front down as it
approaches Western Washington. Possible dry day especially for the
interior Tuesday. Models have been pretty consistent for multiple
runs with an atmospheric river settling up over Western
Washington Wednesday with the feature possibly hanging around
Thursday ( will depend on how deep trough digging south offshore
ends up. The deeper the trough the more it will push the
atmospheric river north of the area ). Temperatures near normal
through Wednesday then a little above normal Thursday. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
