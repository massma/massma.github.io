Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
344 AM PDT Sat Jul 5 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Seasonal temperatures continue today but a warming
trend will follow into early next week as an upper ridge
strengthens over western Washington. The ridge will weaken and
onshore flow will increase for a cooling trend in the second half
of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper trough is pushing
east of W WA, positioning itself over the Inland Northwest this
morning. In its wake, increased onshore flow is introducing more
cloud coverage to start the day. Stratus will gradually burn off
into the afternoon, but some high clouds may continue to drape
the sky. Highs today very similar to the day prior, with
temperatures forecast to top out in the lower to mid 70s and 60s
along the coast. Overnight lows will bottom into the mid 40s to
lower 50s.

Modest warming on tap for Sunday as flow aloft becomes somewhat
zonal. Temperatures won`t stray too far from average, remaining
generally in the mid to upper 70s but locations in the SW interior
and Cascade valleys may top out around 80 F. On Monday, 80s will
become more widespread as upper-level heights rise in response to
stout ridging over the SW. High temperatures will get back into
the lower to mid 80s from the Seattle area southward.


.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The warm spell looks to
peak on Tuesday. Models have upper-ridging becoming a bit more
pronounced as lower to mid 80s continue with upper 80s in the
cards for valley locations. Moderate HeatRisk could be of concern
on Tuesday. The ridge will then flatten on Wednesday as a deep
trough traverses across northern BC. Its influence will be felt
here as flow aloft becomes more zonal with increasing onshore
flow. Models are indicating similar conditions in store through
Friday. The ongoing theme of typically dry conditions for July
continues.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft will continue through the TAF
period as an upper trough over the region moves off to the east
and another approaches the coast of northern California. Onshore
flow will continue in the low levels. Conditions are VFR across
the majority of the area terminals this morning, except MVFR for
KHQM in stratus along the coast. High clouds continue to stream
across the region this morning, but expect stratus to push inland
into portions of the interior by 12Z. Stratus will scatter by 18Z
for a return to more widespread VFR conditions, but high clouds
will continue to stream across the area throughout the day. Westerly
winds will increase across KCLM and through Whidbey Island again
late this afternoon into this evening, while winds across the
central and south Sound, persisting at 4-8 kt today, are expected
to transition from southwesterly to northerly by this evening.

KSEA...VFR with high clouds streaming overhead. Expect cigs to
lower to MVFR in stratus around 12Z. Stratus will then scatter by
18Z for a return to VFR conditions through the remainder of the
evening. Southwesterly surface winds will persist at 4-8 kt today
before shifting to the northwest late this afternoon and into
this evening and increasing to 7-10 kts.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will remain over the coastal waters
through the weekend and strengthen into early next week. Meanwhile,
diurnal westerly pushes will continue over the next several
evenings. Winds tonight have already started to ease across the
central and eastern Strait and will continue to do so through the
early morning hours. The next push tonight will not be as strong,
however expect winds to reach Small Craft Advisory strength. A
weak front may approach the area waters around midweek.

Seas over the coastal waters will generally hover between 3-6 ft
over the next several days, though look to become steep at times
with persistent northerly winds over the coastal waters.
