Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
228 AM PST Sat Nov 30 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will continue to amplify into western
Washington over the weekend and into early next week, allowing
for mostly dry conditions and widespread night and morning fog.
The high pressure ridge will begin to weaken towards the middle of
next week, introducing the next chance for widespread
precipitation across the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface observations early
this morning show areas of patchy fog mainly over areas southwest
of the Puget Sound, though increasing cloud cover has done enough
to inhibit widespread fog development. Conditions will improve
throughout the morning with continued light shower and virga
activity into the afternoon, mainly along the Canadian border.
Forecast models continue to show good agreement over a drying
trend through the short-term under high pressure aloft. This will
likely allow for patchy low clouds and fog each morning with
partly cloudy skies each afternoon. Highs are on track to peak in
the upper 40s to lower 50s each day across the lowlands with lows
bottoming out near or just above the freezing mark through Monday.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...High pressure will remain
firmly in place over western Washington mid-week, allowing for
continued dry conditions with periods of morning fog and low
stratus. The ridge will start to break down towards the end of
next week, with ensembles bringing in the next chance for
widespread precipitation on Thursday and Friday. This incoming
system will bring in warmer temperatures peaking in the mid to
upper 50s for most areas with a more active weather pattern
favored to return by next weekend. Preliminary precipitation
totals are light with the bulk of the incoming moisture focused
over the Olympic Peninsula.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West to northwest flow aloft will continue over
Western Washington today as the region remains on the periphery of
an upper level ridge. Varying degrees of mid and high clouds will
continue to stream across the area. Low level moisture in the form
of low MVFR stratus remains trapped across the interior lowlands
from near KBFI southward. This will likely remain in place through
midday before scattering out to VFR ceilings by around 20Z. Mid and
high level moisture is expected to decrease tonight leading to
greater coverage of IFR/LIFR fog and low clouds on Sunday morning.

KSEA...Low MVFR stratus expected to remain in place through late
morning before scattering to VFR under mid/high clouds this
afternoon. Less high level moisture tonight will be favorable for
the formation of IFR/LIFR in fog or low stratus on Sunday morning.
Surface winds light S/SE shifting to light N/NE late this afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure at the surface and aloft will remain over
the waters into early next week for rather tranquil conditions. A
weakening front will reach the area around midweek before a somewhat
stronger system follows on Thursday.
