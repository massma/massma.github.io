.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A dry and colder air mass will settle over Western
Washington on Monday. Colder temperatures starting Monday night
and continuing through Thursday morning. A wet weather pattern
returns late next week and continues into the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Current satellite imagery
shows abundant cloud cover over Western Washington, while radar
imagery shows isolated showers moving across the region. Expect
cloud cover to gradually decrease into Monday morning.

A drier and much colder air mass will accompany an upper level
trough that will settle into the region on Monday. These colder
temperatures are expected to last through Thursday. Decreasing
cloud cover tonight into Monday morning will help drive low
temperatures into the 20s. On Tuesday and Wednesday morning,
temperatures will be slightly colder, with low temperatures in the
10s to low 20s throughout Western Washington. High temperatures
will struggle to increase past 40 degrees from Monday to
Wednesday.

Breezy easterly winds along the Eastern Puget Sound Lowlands will
also drive apparent temperatures as low as 15 to 20 degrees
Monday morning. With Tuesday and Wednesday`s temperatures being
colder and the easterly winds, apparent temperatures on Tuesday
and Wednesday morning may approach the single digits. The coldest
areas will be along Enumclaw and the I-90 corridor, including
North Bend.

High-resolution guidance is showing a Fraser River Outflow
developing on Monday and lasting through Tuesday. Consequently,
it will lead to very cold overnight apparent temperatures into the
10s.  Colder temperatures are expected Tuesday and Wednesday
morning, where apparent temperatures have the chance of decreasing
into the single digits in Western Whatcom County. A Cold Weather
Advisory has been issued to go into effect later this evening
through Wednesday morning for Western Whatcom County and the San
Juan Islands. As for the San Juan Islands, the colder apparent
temperatures will be along Orcas Island.

With overnight temperatures below freezing, any lingering
moisture during the day will refreeze overnight.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Thursday is looking to be
the last day of very cold temperatures. Temperatures will
gradually begin to increase on Friday. By Sunday high temperatures
will be in the low 40s to mid 40s; while low temperatures will
generally be in the upper 30s to low 40s.

Long-range guidance shows the next weather system possibly
arriving to Western Washington on Thursday night. An upper level
trough is expected to move southward along the West Coast; however
depending on how far south the trough goes, precipitation chances
may be limited in the region to mostly the southern interior. In
addition, models hint at another chance of lowland snow with this
system. However, confidence is low at this time as probabilities
for 0.1 inches or greater ranges between 20-50%, with higher
chances along the southern interior.

Brief ridging on Saturday as the next upper level trough moves
westward towards the region. Snow levels are expected to rise
Saturday night above 4000 ft in the lowlands and remain around
3000-3500 ft along the passes. As a result, this event will bring
back lowland rain and mountain snow back into the forecast.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest flow aloft with light northerly low level
flow. The air mass remains modestly moist, with VFR ceilings.
Ceilings will lower again tonight to MVFR levels particularly
through the central Puget Sound south and west to the coast, and
along the Northern Olympic Peninsula where upslope flow may even
result in light snow showers near KCLM. KPWT and KOLM may dip even
lower with ceilings below 1000 ft and hazy conditions possible after
10Z.

KSEA...VFR ceilings broken to scattered skies and ceilings 5-8 kft
through this evening. Ceilings will lower early Monday morning,
touching at MVFR levels 2.5-3 kft between 12 and 15z. Light north-
northeasterly surface winds becoming northerly 4 to 7 knots this
evening then ease but remain northeasterly into Monday morning.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure over the interior of
British Columbia will strengthen tonight into Monday turning the
flow northerly and offshore. Some modest Fraser River outflow is
expected to develop on Monday across the Northern Inland Waters and
have issued a small craft advisory there through Monday afternoon.
Winds may ease a bit Monday evening, but the general pattern will
then persist into Tuesday. An approaching surface trough over the
Oregon offshore waters will turn the flow increasingly offshore
toward midweek followed by a return of more active weather is
expected by the end of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
