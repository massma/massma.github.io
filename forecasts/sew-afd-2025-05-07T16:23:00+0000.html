Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
923 AM PDT Wed May 7 2025

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak front is moving across Western Washington this
morning, with continued clouds. Onshore flow will increase post-
frontal, allowing for the development of light rain showers mainly
around central Puget Sound and Cascades this afternoon through
this evening. No major forecast updates this morning.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...A weak frontal system will cross the region today
with scattered shower activity and much cooler temperatures. Drier
and mild conditions will return through the remainder of the week
with another frontal system on track to bring unsettled conditions
over the weekend into early next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...A few showers have reached
the coast early this morning ahead of a weak frontal system that
will shift onshore later today with minimal QPF. Temperatures will
take a tumble today with most areas 10 to 15 degrees cooler than
yesterday. Onshore flow increases further behind the front late
today. This should be enough to get a meager convergence zone
going, but it will be short-lived. Onshore flow relaxes and
heights rebound somewhat on Thursday for some sunshine by
afternoon, but temperatures will be held back to around seasonal
norms. Upper ridging is still on track to rebuild somewhat on
Friday for a modest increase in high temperatures and dry
conditions.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The upper ridge weakens
and shifts eastward on Saturday as broad upper troughing deepens
just offshore. Much of the interior should escape with a mostly
dry day, but increasing cloud cover will likely hold temperatures
down a couple degrees or more over those of Friday. By early
Sunday, another weak front is slated to move onshore with another
round of showers for the region. Broad upper troughing takes up
residence along the coast early next week. There are some model
differences with the track of the upper low. While this may affect
the QPF forecast, confidence is high that temperatures will run a
little below normal with a continued threat of showers through
the early part of next week. 27

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>VFR conditions generally expected for most of the TAF
period for most terminals, with the exception of the Pacific coast.
However, guidance is struggling with ceilings this morning with the
interior terminals. It`s possible some terminals may go down to MVFR
as lower cloud decks pass through this morning. A weak cold front
continues to push across Western Washington this morning. Very light
rain is expected with this system, not having much in the way of
impacts. A steadier band of rain may drop cigs to MVFR at times for
interior locations. Coastal terminals may see periods of MVFR to
IFR.Surface winds will pick up out of the southwest at 8 to 15 kts
with gusts to 20 kt possible later this morning, with gusts likely
to be the strongest through the Strait of Juan de Fuca this
afternoon and evening at 25 to 30 kts. Post frontal convergence zone
showers expected this evening in the vicinity of KPAE and well north
of KSEA.

KSEA...Generally VFR cigs for the TAF period. Model guidance has
been struggling this morning resolving cigs as a weak frontal system
pushes through. Some models have VFR prevailing this morning; while
other models have some MVFR cigs until around 19z/20z. Light rain is
expected with this system. With the steadier band of rain coming
later this afternoon, cigs may occasionally drop down to MVFR during
the heavier bands of rain. Southwesterly surface winds to increase
today at 8 to 12 kts with gusts up to 20 kt possible. Convergence
zone activity this evening should remain north of the terminal.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system continues to push across the interior.
Seas are presently hovering around 5 to 6 ft this morning, but will
increase throughout the day to 7 to 8 ft. A westerly push through
the Strait of Juan de Fuca remains at Small Craft Advisory strength
beginning late this morning, where gusts could reach 25 kt.

High pressure rebuilds late this week, but a return to unsettled
conditions are expected into next week.
