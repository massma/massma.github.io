Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
259 PM PDT Wed Sep 25 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showers and possible thunderstorms continue tonight
with onshore flow. Another system will move into the region
Thursday evening into Friday, bringing another round of rain and
gusty winds. Conditions will then dry out over the weekend.
Additional, weaker systems may move into the area early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front is passing
through western WA this afternoon with post-frontal onshore flow
tonight (Puget Sound Convergence Zone setting up over the
King/Snohomish county line). The air mass is slightly unstable
with a chance of thunderstorms in the interior and Cascades (and
within the PSCZ tonight). Most areas seeing measurable rain with
this system with wetting rains in the Cascades. There will be
lingering showers with the convergence zone late tonight.

We`ll see a brief break on Thursday, then more rain and wind
Thursday night into Friday as the next Pacific frontal system
moves in. The coast and North Interior will be the windiest with
south gusts to 30-45 MPH. Total rainfall amounts are less compared
to today`s system with the focus mainly over the northern Olympic
peninsula and North Cascades. Showers will decrease toward the
afternoon as this system lifts north. Temperature-wise, we`ll
continue to track a few degrees cooler than average with highs in
the mid 60s and lows in the 50s.

There`s broad, weak troughing over the region moving into Saturday
but the there`s little moisture or forcing. Overall it`s looking
like a cool and cloudy forecast with dry conditions.  33

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Weak ridging replaces the
trough on Sunday for more cool but dry weather. The wind flow
pattern does turn offshore for less cloud cover. Heights rise
slightly on Monday with a warmer air mass and warmer temps (closer
to average). Ensemble members are mostly in favor for rain
returning Tuesday and Wednesday as the ridge shifts east and
another trough moves in from the Pacific. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front continues to move across western Washington
this afternoon. Strong southwest flow ahead of the front has brought
gusty southwest winds up to 20-25 kt in parts of Puget Sound. Rain
continues to fall across the terminals. The main line has shifted to
primarily to the eastern terminals east of I-5, where light to
moderate rain continues. Sporadic visibility reductions to IFR
continues with the heaviest showers, dropping to or just below 2
miles. While a majority of the rain will dwindle through the
afternoon, model guidance still shows a convergence zone developing
early this evening in Snohomish County (threat of lightning is low).
Ceilings will continue to be a mix of MVFR/VFR, improving to an
overcast VFR deck this evening. A mix of MVFR to LIFR CIGs appear
likely Thursday morning post front with a marine push. The
possibility exists for partial clearing of CIGs in the southern
terminals late Thursday morning/afternoon before the next front
arrives Thursday night/Friday with widespread precipitation. Gusty
southwest winds to 25 kt will be possible Thursday evening/Friday
with this next system.

KSEA...Rain continues to fall over the terminal. Heavier showers
will continue to pose an MVFR threat in VIS/CIGs until a majority of
the activity clears up (after 00Z). Convergence zone activity will
remain north of the terminal this evening (and is not expected to
disturb the southerly winds at 8 to 10 kt this afternoon). Winds
will decrease and CIGs will improve to VFR this evening. Strong
marine push will drop CIGs to MVFR from 12Z-18Z Thursday (25% chance
this drops to IFR), clearing to VFR afterwards. Winds will pick up
out of the southwest at 8 to 10 kt Thursday afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front continues to move through the waters this
afternoon. Rain will continue to move across with this front, with
some of the stronger showers reducing visibilities at times (thunder
threat is low). Strong southerly winds continue to diminish behind
the front (buoy 41 showing gusts to 20 kt and seas dropping from
13.5 feet earlier this afternoon down to 6 to 8 feet). The gusty
wind threat continues for the central/east Strait of Juan de Fuca
(small craft advisory continues through late tonight with the threat
of westerlies of 15 to 25 kt with gusts to 35 kt possible).

A second front remains on track to pass through the region Thursday
afternoon into Friday. Widespread gusty southerly winds 20 to 30 kt
(with gusts to 35 kt) are expected over the coastal waters Thursday
afternoon and evening. Post front, gusty winds are expected to make
their way through the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and some of the inland
waters. In addition, seas will build back up to 13 to 16 feet at 10
to 12 seconds (with the highest seas in the outer coastal waters).
Behind the front, winds will turn to the west and northwest, and
remain only breezy in the outer coastal waters Friday and Saturday
(up to 20 kt). Seas will drop to 6 to 8 feet for the weekend, and
further decrease to 4 to 6 feet next week.
