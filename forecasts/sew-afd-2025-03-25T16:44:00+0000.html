Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
944 AM PDT Tue Mar 25 2025

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Dense fog has developed over area waters this morning,
though the fog layer is shallow enough that it will likely break
down by the afternoon hours. Temperatures are on track to peak
well above normal today, nearing or surpassing 70 degrees for most
lowland locations. A few new daily record temperatures are
possible for areas surrounding the Puget Sound.

The focus then shifts to convection on Wednesday, with impactful
weather on tap for all of western Washington. As a low pressure
system approaches the Pacific Coast, showers and embedded
thunderstorms are likely to form over the Olympic Peninsula
throughout the mid to late morning hours. A dynamic warm front
will lift across the region throughout the afternoon and into the
evening, bringing a round of widespread and potentially strong
thunderstorms northward. The primary threats for these storms will
be hail and/or gusty winds, alongside frequent lightning and
locally heavy rain. The tornado threat continues to be very low
(2% chance), but a brief spinup cannot be ruled out. The strongest
storms are currently favored to move northward east of the Puget
Sound Wednesday along the I-5 corridor during the mid- to-late
afternoon, likely causing impacts for the afternoon commute.
Conditions will continue to be monitored as updated forecast model
data comes in. No updates this morning.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Building high pressure will result in a dry, unusually
warm day Tuesday. A system Wednesday will bring a chance for
widespread thunderstorms to the region. Showery and somewhat
unsettled weather will linger Thursday through Saturday, followed
by a break in the weather late this weekend. Another round of
active weather greets us next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...A warm and mild air mass is
in place today with arcing high pressure over the region. Radar
still shows lingering showers near the Canadian border that will
shift farther north this afternoon. But the main story is the warm
temperatures on tap. Temps have been balmy overnight with mid 50s,
which is near our normal highs. There`s also patchy low clouds and
fog around the coast and interior where dew point depressions
remain tight. But by this afternoon, we`re looking at highs
reaching the upper 60s to lower 70s (warmest of the season so far)
that will likely break record daily maxes for a few spots.

Wednesday`s main focus is on developing convection/thunderstorms
over OR/WA as a cold front moves in. Across western WA, the air
mass will remain moist and unstable under S/SW diffluent flow.
Mean CAPE values from the HREF model are over 1,000 J/kg during
the afternoon and early evening - pretty high for our region
during any season. From the Storm Prediction Center, there is a
Marginal Risk of severe weather across the region (isolated severe
storms are possible). Hail and wind are the main threats, along
with cloud-to-ground lightning and periods of heavy rainfall.
Severe weather parameters decrease late Wednesday evening as the
cold front moves inland (after 03-06z).

Thursday`s weather will remain showery with a deep/stacked low
spinning offshore. It`ll be cooler overall but still mild with
highs in the 50s to lower 60s. Expect breezy conditions along the
coast and north interior with S/SE gusts to 30-40 mph. 33

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Upper level troughing over
the Pac NW will maintain showers as we move toward the end of the
week. Temperatures will be back to our seasonal averages with
highs in the lower to mid 50s. A weak ridge brings a short break
in the weather moving into Sunday. More wet and windy weather is
headed our way next week as low pressure shifts inland. 33

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft this morning as weak ridging
moves over western Washington. Showers across the area this morning
have moved north into Canada. Abundant low level moisture has worked
into the region, and this has created areas of mist/fog in pockets
of south Puget Sound/South Interior/Olympics up to the San Juans.
Once temperatures warm up, most of the fog/mist will begin to burn
off by early this afternoon. Will have VFR skies with high clouds
across most of the region this afternoon. Surface winds will pick up
out of the north later today at 5 to 10 kt. There will be another
round of mist/fog possible tomorrow morning, along with a
destabilizing airmass in place for afternoon thunderstorms - some
possibly strong to severe with cumulonimbus producing lightning,
hail and gusty winds.

KSEA...Patchy mist will continue at the terminal this morning
through at least 17Z (some lower visibilities observed just to the
north at KBFI). Mid to high level VFR clouds will help break up the
mist going into the afternoon. North winds will pick up later this
morning at 5 to 10 kt. There is a 25% chance of IFR tomorrow via
fog/mist Wednesday morning, with convection expected later in the
day on Wednesday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>For the morning update, a marine dense fog advisory was
issued for Puget Sound/Admiralty Inlet/East Strait of Juan de
Fuca areas through 11 AM PDT this morning. Visibilities in these
areas have been observed at or less than 1 mile. Lower ceilings
are being observed in the Central Strait of Juan de Fuca and
portions of the Northern Inland Waters (but are a bit higher than
the fog to the south based on observations/satellite).

Surface high pressure offshore will continue to linger
over the coastal waters today, giving way to calmer and benign
conditions. A strong frontal system will start to approach the
waters Wednesday into Thursday, with increasing southerlies across
the area waters. Increasing southerlies will approach small craft
advisory criteria Wednesday afternoon, but as the low approaches
closer to the coast, winds will continue increase in strength.
Latest guidance highlights gale winds over the coastal waters
through Thursday, with a w low 10-20% chance of Storm Force Gusts
over the coastal waters. For the uncertainty in wind strength,
have issued a Gale Watch for late Wednesday into Thursday for all
of the coastal water zones. Elsewhere, small craft southerlies can
be expected in the interior (the exception being the Eastern
Entrance of the Strait, where winds could be stronger).

In addition to winds, a chance of thunderstorms will exist over
most of the waters on Wednesday. The main threats from these
thunderstorms are - small hail, erratic changes in wind
direction, and heavy rain.

Combined seas 7 to 9 feet through Wednesday afternoon, before
gradually building upwards to 10 to 14 feet by Thursday morning.
Seas will continue to build through Thursday, upwards to 18 to 22
feet by late night Thursday. The highest seas during this time
(20-22 feet) will mainly be in the outer coastal water zones. Seas
will decrease into the weekend to around 10 feet.

.HYDROLOGY...The Skokomish River will drop below flood stage this
morning and all rivers will recede today with dry weather. A round
of heavy showers and thunderstorms are likely on Wednesday with
heavy showers focused over the Olympics on Thursday. Round after
round of heavy rain may keep the Skokomish River running high with
renewed flooding possible.
