Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
933 AM PDT Tue Apr 8 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Upper level trough moving through Western Washington
this afternoon. Upper level ridge building behind the trough late
tonight into Wednesday. The ridge will move east Wednesday night
with the next front arriving later Thursday. Upper level trough
over the area Friday and Saturday. Another upper level ridge
building Sunday and Monday.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The latest forecast remains
on track with no updates this morning. Upper level trough axis
moving inland this afternoon making for a cool and showery day.
Convective parameters slightly worse today versus Monday with the
cool air aloft already in place. Lapse rates are slightly lower,
lifted indexes are still for the most part positive and convective
temperatures are a couple of degrees warmer. Still with the 500
mb temperatures around -28C and the trough axis moving inland
during the afternoon will stay with a slight chance of
thunderstorms in the afternoon. Winds increasing behind the trough
axis with increasing onshore flow. Snow levels around 4000 feet
with another 4 to 8 inches of new snow at Mount Rainier and Mount
Baker. Winds not strong enough for an advisory with gusts 25 to 35
mph late afternoon. Highs in the mid 50s.

Trough axis moving quickly east tonight with an upper level ridge
beginning to build over Western Washington from the south in the
early morning hours. Shower activity decreasing by late evening
with just a chance of showers by midnight. The exception to this
will be in a convergence zone over Snohomish county where showers
will hang on until the early morning hours. Gusty southerly winds
in the evening hours, 25 to 35 mph, easing after midnight. Lows a
little cooler, upper 30s to mid 40s.

Upper level ridge continuing to build over Western Washington
Wednesday with what is left of the shower activity drying up. By
Wednesday afternoon just a chance of showers near the Canadian
border. The combination of the ridge not being that strong, 500 mb
heights in the lower to mid 560 dms, and southwesterly flow aloft
spreading high level moisture into the area will go mostly
cloudy/partly sunny. With the ridge highs a little warmer, a
couple of degrees either side of 60.

Upper level ridge shifting east Wednesday night but the next
system well offshore by 12z Thursday. High clouds over the area
will keep temperatures from falling too far. Lows in the lower to
mid 40s.

Next front reaching the coast late Thursday with rain out ahead
of the front along the coast in the morning spreading inland in
the afternoon. Western Washington in the warm sector ahead of the
front. Highs in the lower to mid 60s inland with upper 50s along
the coast.

Front moving through Western Washington Thursday night with rain
changing to showers.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Extended models continue to
be in good agreement Friday and Saturday with an upper level
trough over the area moving east later Saturday. A couple of cool
and showery days with highs in the lower to mid 50s.

Models in better agreement Sunday and Monday with an upper level
ridge building over the area. GFS has the ridge axis further to
the west which could open the door for a shortwave moving down the
backside of the ridge to trigger showers over the Cascades Sunday.
The more easterly ECMWF ridge axis does not have this feature.
Ensembles leaning towards the ECMWF solution. Will go dry Sunday
and Monday. Highs in the mid to upper 50s Sunday warming a few
degrees for Monday. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West-southwest flow aloft throughout the period. Closer
to the surface, mixed VFR/MVFR cigs currently as showers track
across W WA. More widespread MVFR cigs developing between 17-21z
as a frontal system sweeps through with steadier rain. Breezy SW
winds upwards of 30-35 kt during the afternoon before gradually
decreasing into the nighttime. Areas of VFR are favored to return
during the afternoon-early evening as well but low-level moisture
will keep low clouds around overnight into early Wednesday.

KSEA...VFR currently as showers track across the airfield. Rain and
showers are to persist today as a disturbance enters between 17-22z.
During this time, MVFR cigs/vis are possible under heavier
precipitation. After 21-22z, VFR is favored to rebound and likely
remain overnight into early Wednesday. Surface winds out of the S
5 to 10 kt shifting SW into the afternoon between 10-15 kt with
gusts upwards of 25-30 kt. Winds decrease in magnitude overnight.

.MARINE...SCAs remain over the coastal waters and have been issued
for portions of the inland waters for today. A compact 1004 mb
surface will track across the region today with breezy southerly
winds. In its wake, a westerly push is favored to develop in the
strait this afternoon-evening before fizzling out overnight. A brief
break in the weather Wednesday and Thursday before another system
approaches the area near the end of the week.

Combined seas around 9 to 11 feet will generally remain through
today. Seas look to subside to around 5 to 7 feet by midweek, before
gradually building back up to 10 feet by the end of the week.

.HYDROLOGY...Skokomish River in Mason county a little over a foot
below flood stage and rising this morning. Another round of
showers over the South Slopes of the OLympics today will keep the
river rising through tonight. Still possible the river could
reach flood stage late tonight/early Wednesday morning.

No flooding for the next 7 days on the remainder of the rivers in
Western Washington. Felton
