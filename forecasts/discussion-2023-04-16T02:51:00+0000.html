Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
1051 PM EDT Sat Apr 15 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
Weak low pressure passes across the area tonight and then east
on Sunday. A cold front will approach Sunday night and move
across the area on Monday. Weakening low pressure remains
over eastern Canada and into the northeast Monday night and
Tuesday. High pressure builds in for Tuesday night into
Wednesday, and moves offshore Wednesday night. A frontal system
impacts the area Friday into Saturday.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SUNDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments to
temperatures and dew points. Widespread showers with embedded
thunderstorms have come to an end with only isolated showers
over the area.

Areas of dense fog have developed across most of Suffolk County
this evening. Fog will persist into the overnight hours, with
the dense fog possibly becoming more widespread. A dense fog
advisory has been issued for eastern Suffolk, and southwestern
Suffolk. Through southern Connecticut and northwestern Suffolk
fog was widespread with visibilities around 1 mile, or less,
with patchy dense fog. Have issued a special weather statement
for these areas, and if the dense fog becomes more widespread a
dense fog advisory may be needed.

An upper low over the Middle Atlantic will move across the area
tonight. Accompanying the upper low will be a weak surface low
that moves near Long Island tonight and then east early Sunday
morning.

The weak surface low passing to the east could sustain some
scattered showers across eastern Long Island and eastern
Connecticut into the early morning hours.

Another round of record high minimums are possible before
midnight (see climate section below). Lows Sunday morning will
be in the 50s, about 10-15 degrees above normal.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH MONDAY/...
The upper low and weak surface low shift east of the area early
Sunday. Heights will build aloft behind the departing system and
a much stronger upper low near the Great Lakes.

Sunday should be mainly dry with low clouds and fog lingering
along the immediate coast. There should be at least partial
clearing across the interior and potentially down into the NYC
metro in the afternoon. Highs will range from the 60s across
Long Island and Connecticut and the lower 70s along and east of
the Hudson River.

The associated cold front approaches Sunday night and the moves
across the area on Monday. Fog remains possible, especially near
the immediate coast. A band of showers will accompany the front
Monday morning and then lift out of the area early Monday
afternoon, potentially lingering across eastern CT longest.
There is some very marginal instability, but have left mention
of thunder out of the forecast for now. Rainfall continue to
look around a quarter inch or less. Decreasing clouds and
improving conditions are expected from west to east in the late
afternoon/early evening. Temperatures remain above normal on
Monday with highs in the 60s.

&&

.LONG TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...
A weakening upper low and surface low remain across eastern
Canada Monday night into Tuesday as cyclonic flow persists.
Lingering low level moisture will allow for clouds Monday night
into Tuesday with a more seasonal airmass moving into the
region. Have trended dry for Monday night into Tuesday as the
low and better lift has shifted northward. Heights begin to rise
with weak ridging Tuesday night as the upper low continues to
weaken and track north. Weak low level cold advection will end
toward Wednesday morning, and warm advection then sets up during
Wednesday. A warm front will be approaching late Wednesday into
Wednesday night. Moisture will be limited with the front, and
the best frontal forcing and frontolysis is also to the north.
The NBM and global guidance keep the area dry for now, however
with precipitation possible just to the north a shift southward
in the later guidance may have light rain across portions of the
region. With the area likely warm sectored Thursday and Friday
have leaned toward the 75th percentile for temperatures. A cold
front will approach later Friday into Saturday, and possible
move through late in the day. There are timing uncertainties
this far out in time, and with a negatively tilted upper trough
and closed low remaining well to the west. Best chances,
although just slight, for convection will be across the inland
areas away from the marine influence, and have added a slight
chance Friday afternoon.

&&

.AVIATION /03Z SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak low pressure will slowly pass through the area tonight
and into Sunday.

Widespread IFR and LIFR tonight. LIFR is most likely for most
coastal and NYC terminals with fog and low stratus. A slight
improvement to MVFR is possible for NYC and interior terminals
by early afternoon. Coastal terminals may briefly improve to
MVFR mid-afternoon Sunday but there is a chance it remains IFR
all day. Any MVFR conditions Sunday afternoon drop to IFR again
by Sunday evening.

Isolated rain showers are possible through the overnight period.

Winds mainly E-ESE at 10 kt or less through the TAF period,
with direction VRB at times.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Timing of category changes tonight and then improvements on
Sunday may be +/- a few hours.

Amendments likely for changing categories this evening and into
Sunday morning.

 OUTLOOK FOR 00Z MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...

Sunday night: IFR or lower possible. Chance of showers late.
Light and vrb winds becoming E.

Monday: MVFR or lower with a chance of shwrs, mainly early.
Winds shifting to the SW.

Tuesday-Thursday: VFR with W flow.

.MARINE...
A dense fog advisory is in effect on all waters through 8 am
Sunday. There has been some brief improvement in visibility
noted on some webcams near shore in the NY Harbor, ocean west
of Fire Island Inlet, and western Long Island Sound. However,
think this will be short-lived as warm and moist air will
continue to move over the colder waters. Loss of daytime heating
with sunset and a continued SE flow will help cool the boundary
layer to support redevelopment/expansion of dense fog.
Elsewhere, dense fog is expected to persist into early Sunday
morning. Areas of fog will likely persist on the waters on
Sunday, but confidence is not high if it will be dense or not
beyond early Sunday morning. An extension in time of the
advisory is possible.

Otherwise, an weak easterly flow across the waters Sunday night
will result in sub-SCA conditions. A cold front moves across the
waters Monday morning, and winds will increase behind the front
to around 20 kt Monday afternoon.

Marginal SCA conditions are possible on the eastern ocean waters
early Monday night as a cold front passes to the east. Then behind
the cold front marginal SCA gusts will be possible across the
forecast waters Tuesday, and possible into Tuesday night on the
ocean waters. Gusts across the forecast waters diminish Tuesday
night as high pressure builds toward the waters. And winds and seas
remain below advisory levels Wednesday into Thursday.
