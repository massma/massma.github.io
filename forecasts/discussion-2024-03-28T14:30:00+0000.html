Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
1030 AM EDT Thu Mar 28 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
Low pressure develops along the Carolina coast today, then
tracks up the Atlantic and east of the region on Friday. The low
reaches the Canadian Maritimes on Saturday. High pressure
briefly returns Sunday before another low pressure system
impacts the region Monday through Wednesday.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments to
temperature and dew points to reflect the most recent
observations.

Periods of rain expected through the day. Deep lift expected with
the jet in a favorable position. Heaviest rain will be for the
central and eastern portions of the CWA based on the trajectory
of the moisture plume on water vapor and the modeling which was
in good agreement.

A coastal low south of the area is modeled to gradually deepen
through the day, dropping about 10-15 mb by 6Z Fri. The low will
begin to get better organized by 12Z Fri as the northern stream
trough fuels development, but at this point the low should be E
of the benchmark.

Used NBM pops for the timing of the back edge of the rain
tonight. If the track and timing holds, W of the Hudson would
be dry by midnight. The rain hangs on a little longer eastern
zones, particularly the Twin Forks, but there is little evidence
in the 00Z runs of significant wraparound pcpn with the low, at
least for our CWA.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT/...
The low deepens significantly on Fri as it tracks towards the
Maritimes. Deep mixing on nwly flow will produce a windy day.
Although not extreme, there could be some gusts to around 35-40
mph with winds in the 25-35kt range thru h85. Some high based cu
is modeled in both the NAM and GFS due to steep low and mid lvl
lapse rates.

Breezy near the coasts Fri ngt as the flow aloft strengthens,
but the cooling bl will be a limiting factor. Temps in the 30s
per the NBM which was used.

Dry to start on Sat then there is a chance for some light rain
by late aftn and Sat ngt. There is still some uncertainty as the
clipper type low is too far S in the GFS to produce pcpn. The
ECMWF and NAM are the wetter solns. Pops about 20 percent for
this event attm. The NBM was followed for temps.

&&

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
No significant changes in the long term period. Zonal flow
become reestablished Sunday night and yet another upper trough
and surface frontal system will be quickly approaching for
Monday. Initially, a warm front will move toward the area
Monday, and then the associated low will move slowly eastward
into the region Tuesday and Wednesday. With near seasonal
temperatures through much of the extended period, except
slightly above for Saturday and Sunday, all liquid precipitation
is expected. And NBM temperatures looked reasonable through the
extended and were used.

&&

.AVIATION /14Z THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front slowly approaches tonight from the west. A wave of
low pressure then advances along it from the south today and
tonight.

IFR cigs are expected for much of the day today with rain,
however can not rule out period where conditions improve for a
short time. Improvement to MVFR is possible late this afternoon
for the NYC terminals and terminals to the north and west,
becoming more likely toward 00Z Fri. A return to VFR is expected
overnight. Rain tapers off late tonight.

Winds will remain fairly light and a bit variable in direction
at around 5 kt into early afternoon. Winds then shift to the
NNW and increase to near 10 kt for this afternoon. NNW winds
further increase to 10 to 15 kt tonight. Gusts develop toward
00Z Fri, upwards of 20 to 25 kt tonight.

     NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Low chance LIFR at JFK could last until 16Z. High confidence
cigs at JFK stay at or below 700 ft before 17Z.

Timing of category changes may be off by several hours.
Amendments likely for changing flight categories.

OUTLOOK FOR 12Z FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY...

Friday: Any left over MVFR conditions, becoming VFR in the
afternoon. Slight chance of rain early for KISP and KGON. NW
wind gusts 20-25 kt.

Saturday: Mainly VFR during the day. Chance of showers and MVFR
at night, possibly mixed with snow for KSWF. W-NW wind gusts
20-25 kt day. Gusts diminish at night.

Sunday: Mainly VFR. NW wind gusts 15-20 kt afternoon into evening.

Monday: MVFR possible with a chance of showers.

.MARINE...
A sca remains in effect for the cntrl and ern ocean today for 5
ft seas. Wind will otherwise be lgt, but pick up tngt on all
waters as low pres develops. A sca for the protected waters and
a gale watch for the ocean remain in effect for tngt. Winds were
too mrgnl to convert the watch to a warning attm.

For Fri into Sat, solid sca cond expected. There is a chc for
gales Fri and Fri ngt, but it is too mrgnl attm to go with a
watch.

A light flow is expected Sunday through Monday as high pressure
moves through the forecast waters and conditions remain below
advisory levels across the forecast waters.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
Up to 2 inches of additional rain is expected through tonight
across the ern half of the region. Around an inch or less is
expected elsewhere. No significant hydrologic impacts are
expected, unless the 2 inch axis of heavy rain shifts
significantly W into the more flood prone areas of the HSA.

Otherwise, no hydrologic impacts are anticipated into the
middle of next week.
