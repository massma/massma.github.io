Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
209 AM PDT Sun Sep 8 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cooling trend will set up over western Washington as
troughing returns to the region. Periods of light precipitation
will enter the region alongside below- normal temperatures under
an unsettled pattern through next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southerly flow aloft will
continue through the morning, maintaining hazy skies and elevated
low temperatures across the region. A weak shortwave rippling
through the flow aloft is generating light showers, but most of
the activity is expected to stay to the east of the Cascade crest
this morning. Onshore flow will also bring in a marine push of
low stratus this morning, with ensembles suggesting the stratus
will make it as far inland as the south Puget Sound. Inland areas
will see the stratus burn off by the late morning with highs
peaking near the 80 degree mark, while coastal areas will see the
low stratus persist with highs in the 60s.

The trough axis will swing across western Washington later tonight,
ushering in westerly flow aloft that will scour out most of the
smoke aloft and bring in a cooler air mass. Stronger onshore flow
with zonal flow aloft will bring in increased cloud cover overnight
into Monday morning. Temperatures will return to near normal with
highs in the low to mid 70s across the lowlands and in the mid 60s
along the coast.

While forecast models continue to disagree over the depth of the
next incoming system, a trough is on track to approach the region
on Tuesday. This will allow for even cooler temperatures, with a
chance for incoming showers to spread across western Washington
later in the day.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Models remain in good
agreement over troughing mid-week, with a round of showers through
late Wednesday. Despite light rainfall amounts, the storm system
will cool conditions off well below normal with temperatures
peaking in the mid 60s on Wednesday. Below normal temperatures
will continue through the remainder of the period with an
unsettled pattern favored to continue through the rest of the
week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak upper level trough will move through the area today
and bring about more southwest, turning westerly, flow. This will
help filter the mid and upper level smoke to the east, with more
significant clearing by Monday. Today, expect some marine stratus to
make it to the Kitsap peninsula. There is roughly a 30 to 40 percent
chance of ceilings at or below 1000 feet across Puget Sound through
15Z this morning. Ceilings will be improving thereafter with MVFR
cigs left on the coast.

With smoke lingering today, expect some reductions in slantwise
visibility before it begins to push east.

KSEA...Probabilities of cigs at or below 1000 feet at the terminal
will be between 20 to 30 percent through 15Z this morning,
decreasing thereafter. Surface flow is expected to be out of the
southwest for most of the TAF period. Smoke impacts will continue
through the day before flow becomes more westerly overnight and
scours it to the east.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow due to a weak frontal passage continues today
with small craft advisory winds in the central and eastern Strait of
Juan de Fuca tonight. Marine stratus clouds will impact most waters
through around 15Z this morning, scattering out thereafter through
18-20Z. Wave heights are expected to be between 3 to 6 feet
throughout the forecast period. A stronger frontal system bringing a
chance of rain to all area waters is expected to arrive by mid-week.
