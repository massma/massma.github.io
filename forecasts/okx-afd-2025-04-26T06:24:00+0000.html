Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
224 AM EDT Sat Apr 26 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system impacts the region through this evening. High
pressure builds to the west during Sunday, and builds over the
region Sunday night through Monday. The high pushes off the Mid-
Atlantic Coast Monday night which allows a warm front to
approach and then lift north Tuesday night. This will be
followed by a cold frontal passage Wednesday. High pressure then
builds in from the northwest through Wednesday night, pushing
off Thursday. This will allow another frontal system to approach
and affect the area at the end of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM THIS MORNING/...
Some low level dry air is limiting the rain reaching the ground
despite radar reflectivity late this evening across western
parts of the region. Still left out thunder for rest of tonight
as mesoscale models seem to be too moist in the low levels and
therefore there is more stability in the low level environment
inhibiting convection. Minor changes with POPs for showers and
some minor adjustments with temperatures as well as dewpoints to
better match observed trends.

Low pressure tracks well to the west tonight, through the
eastern Great Lakes as a weak warm front approaches to the
southwest. There is little forcing with the front, and guidance
shows that the front may dissipate before moving into the
region. Chances for showers increase late tonight as the low
moves into upstate New York and shortwave energy rotates through
the upper trough across the northeast.

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM THIS MORNING THROUGH 6 PM SUNDAY/...
As one area of energy moves out of the region early Saturday
morning showers may become more scattered before increasing late
morning into the afternoon as a cold front approaches and
additional energy moves into the region. With increasing CAPE
late morning and through the afternoon, across northeastern New
Jersey, into the lower Hudson Valley, NYC, and into Nassau
county, and southwestern Connecticut, thunderstorms will be
possible. Farther to the east the marine influence will be great
enough to keep thunderstorms from tracking farther to the east.
An isolated storm or tow is possible, however, not enough
coverage and confidence to include in the forecast at this time.
The flow is progressive and the upper trough and cold front
moves through the northeast with showers ending by late Saturday
night. A gusty northwest flow develops behind the cold front
and blended in the 90th percentile of the NBM for both sustained
winds and gusts late Saturday night and through Sunday.

&&

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...
Cut off low and associated upper level trough push continue to
move away from the area Sunday night as a building upper level
ridge from the Great Lakes region approaches. At the surface,
high pressure to the east builds into the region, pushing south
of the area and off the Mid-Atlantic Coast Monday night.

Upper level ridge axis moves over the area Tuesday, with a warm
front lifting north of the area Tuesday night, followed pretty
quickly by the cold front Wednesday. The passage of the cold front
looks moisture starved, lacks a strong upper level trough, and with
the surface low passing well north and west of the region in
southern Quebec, much of the forcing with this front will be well
north of the area. Therefore, not looking at a lot of precipitation.
In fact, while there might be some light rain showers Tuesday night
in association with the warm front, the passage of the cold front
may move through dry.

High pressure builds in for Wednesday through Wednesday night as
another upper ridge moves through the northeast Thursday night,
which allows the next frontal system to approach for the end of next
week.

As for temperatures, they will be above normal and on the increase
from Monday through Wednesday, with Tuesday being the warmest. Highs
will be in the 70s away from the coast, and 60s along the coast.
Temperatures fall back to seasonable on Thursday, with 60s expected
region-wide, with slightly warmer readings expected for Friday.

.AVIATION /06Z SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front moves through this evening.

Mainly IFR through this morning, improving to MVFR this
afternoon, then VFR behind the cold front passage this evening.
Showers possible at any given time through early this evening,
but somewhat more likely before 12z and then again after 17z.
TSTM also possible starting this afternoon for all but
KISP/KBDR/KGON.

S winds 10-15kt increase a little after 12z, veering S-SW this
afternoon, increasing, and becoming more gusty. Winds shift W-NW
behind the front with gusts 25-30kt.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Chance that KEWR and KTEB never lower to IFR, or that timing of
IFR is off by 1-2 hours. Improvement back to MVFR and VFR may be
off by 1-2 hours.

Gusts may be only occasional during the morning hours.

.OUTLOOK FOR 06Z SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...

Late tonight: VFR with W-NW gusts 25-30kt

Sunday: VFR. NW wind gusts 25-30 kt. Wind gusts lower to near
20 kt in the evening and diminish overnight.

Monday: VFR.

Tuesday: Mainly VFR. Possible MVFR at night with possible
showers. SW wind gusts 15-20 kt in the afternoon at night. Wind
gusts up to 25 kt possible at times for afternoon into evening.

Wednesday: VFR. W-NW wind gusts 15-20 kt.

.MARINE...
With the approach of low pressure moving across the eastern
Great Lakes region late tonight into Saturday morning, and a
warm front to the southwest, southerly winds will be increasing
this evening, and ocean seas will be building. Have begun the
ocean SCA a few hours earlier, 200 AM EDT, with the earlier
increasing gusts and seas. Otherwise, the other advisories
remain as previously posted. Southerly winds and gusts increase
Saturday, and there is the potential of gusts approaching gale
force east of Moriches Inlet for a few hours late Saturday
morning into the afternoon, and near SCA levels on the central
Long Island Sound. With the short period and low confidence will
not post a gale of small craft for those zones. Winds and gusts
will likely fall below advisory levels Saturday evening for
several hours as the cold front moves through, however, ocean
seas will likely remain elevated. Then SCA conditions develop on
all the waters late Saturday night and through Sunday, and
possibly into Sunday evening, behind a cold front, and
advisories may be issued later.

Winds and waves are expected to remain below SCA criteria through
Tuesday. Wind gusts of 25 to 30 kt are possible over the ocean and
south shore bays Tuesday night with the approach and passage of a
cold front. Waves build to 5 to 6 ft on the ocean waters during this
time frame. Waves slowly diminish Tuesday night, falling below SCA
criteria on Wednesday.
