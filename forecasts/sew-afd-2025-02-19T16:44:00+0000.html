Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
844 AM PST Wed Feb 19 2025

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system continues to move across Western
Washington this morning for widespread lowland rain and mountain
snowfall. Given the increased snowfall amounts in the forecast for
the central Cascades, have issued a Winter Weather Advisory though
early Thursday morning, including both Stevens and Snoqualmie
Pass. The bulk of the snow accumulation is expected later this
afternoon into tonight as winds transition more westerly.
Generally 5 to 8 inches of snow is expected, with the higher
amounts at Stevens Pass. Otherwise, the forecast is on track.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...A warm front will continue to advance across western
Washington today, with lowland rain and mountain snow continuing
ahead of a trailing cold front. A weak upper ridge will build
into the region Thursday, but will only be a brief break as the
region will again see another series of fronts approach Friday. An
atmospheric river looks to move into western Washington over the
weekend, bringing heavy rain to the area into early next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The next weather system is
already pushing into the region with the leading warm front
lifting across the region, spreading widespread rainfall and some
mountain snow into the Cascades. Snow levels may rise just a bit
in the warm sector before the trailing cold front, in the process
of occluding, makes its way across Western Washington late today.
Expect continued lowland rain and mountain snow above around 3500
ft through the day, with snow levels rising closer to 4500 ft in
spots. Light easterly winds near Snoqualmie maintain a low (10%)
likelihood of freezing rain, but thermal profile looks marginal
and suggests the precipitation may fall mostly as snow. Most
likely snow amounts remain around 5-6 inches for the central
Cascades (including Stevens and Snoqualmie passes) with higher
amounts in the southern zones (including Paradise and White Pass).
It`s worth noting that the "high-end" snow amounts for the
central Cascades have increased a little bit owing to heavier
focused precipitation late tonight behind the cold front. So,
while the forecast hasn`t changed (nor has the current winter
weather advisory), will need to continue to evaluate the threat
and any potential need to expand the advisory northward.

Showers will then taper by late Thursday morning as a weak upper
level high pressure moves back over the area. This upper ridge
will give a break in the action for most, but some light
precipitation remains possible closer to the coast and the far
northern areas as the leading warm front associated with the next
system isn`t too far behind. For most though, a drier day with
temperatures in the upper 40s to lower 50s. Another cold front
sweeps across the region on Friday as it falls apart. This will
bring much more modest precipitation amounts with up to around a
tenth of an inch of rain for most (locally higher to around half
an inch along the coast), and another light snow accumulation down
to around 4000 ft. This will just be setting the stage for the
weekend, however.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The weekend looks to be
rather wet across the region with an atmospheric river setting up
near the region Saturday and over the area into the first part of
next week. The rainfall amounts remain fairly similar to the
previous forecast and remain in line with a slightly wetter shift
in the probabilistic guidance this cycle. With a fairly mild air
mass over the region and snow levels climbing to 6000 ft or higher
on Saturday, expect much of this precipitation to fall in liquid
form. This will enhance the risk of seeing areas rivers rise
closer to flood stage - see the HYDROLOGY section for additional
details regarding this threat. The pattern looks to remain active
with another disturbance crossing the region by Tuesday, though
at least it appears a bit more fast-moving which will limit
impacts.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>South to southwest flow aloft will veer westerly later
today as an upper level trough and associated frontal system move
onshore. VFR ceilings early will deteriorate to MVFR at times by
late morning through this afternoon as rain continues to spread
eastward across the area. Precipitation will decrease by late
afternoon and evening behind the front, but a moist air mass will
remain in place with ceilings consolidating into mostly MVFR. There
may be a brief rise into VFR early this evening before returning to
high-end MVFR. Gusty southerly surface winds are expected to develop
across the interior by early afternoon and persist through the
evening before gradually easing overnight.

KSEA...VFR ceilings in light rain are expected to gradually lower to
MVFR by late this morning just ahead of an occluded front.
Precipitation is expected to diminish after 00Z with ceilings in the
higher range of MVFR persisting into tonight. There may be a brief
rise in ceilings above 3000 ft between around 03-09Z Thursday before
returning to high MVFR. Surface winds E/SE 8 to 12 knots shifting
southerly with the arrival of the front and increasing to 15 to 25
knots at times mid-afternoon through the evening before gradually
easing.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Gales over much of the coastal waters will transition to
small craft advisory conditions in the wake of an occluded front
that will move onshore around midday. Have extended the Gale Warning
over the outer coastal waters for lingering gusts behind the frontal
passage into this afternoon. Surface high pressure rebuilding behind
the front will lead to a punch of westerlies through the Strait of
Juan de Fuca as well as an increase in southerlies through Puget
Sound through Admiralty Inlet into the Northern Interior Waters this
afternoon and evening. Surface ridging over the coastal waters
tonight will shift inland on Thursday as another warm front lifts
northward across the offshore and coastal waters. A series of
systems will impact the waters Friday through the weekend likely
necessitating additional headlines for wind and/or seas across much
of the area waters.

Seas 10 to 15 ft today and tonight. Dominant periods of around 10
seconds are making for very choppy seas. Seas may briefly subside to
around 8 to 9 ft on Thursday (with dominant period increasing to
around 14-15 sec) before becoming hazardous once again during an
active time expected Friday through weekend.

.HYDROLOGY...An active pattern will bring a series of frontal
systems across the region this week. With snow levels generally
around 3000 feet, expect some rises on rivers (especially the
Skokomish) but river flooding is not expected through Friday. The
additional moisture, however, could set the stage for a more
hydrologically notable event by the weekend. The potential
arrival of an atmospheric river this weekend into early next week
would have the potential to push rivers even higher, opening the
door to the potential for flooding by the early portion of next
week.

It is increasingly likely that snow levels will climb into the
6000 ft or higher range this weekend as a mild and moist weather
system takes aim at the region. While there remains some
uncertainty with respect to the location of heaviest rainfall,
there`s a high likelihood (greater than 70% chance) of 3 to 4
inches of rain across the mountains. With around a 40% chance of
seeing a 5+ inch total in the favored locations of the Olympics
and the central Cascades, will need to closely monitor the
precipitation forecasts heading into the weekend.
