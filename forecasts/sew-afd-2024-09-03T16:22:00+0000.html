.SYNOPSIS...A strong upper level ridge will rebuild into the
region by midweek for a return of much warmer temperatures and
dry conditions. The ridge will gradually weaken and shift eastward
by the weekend for a cooling trend.

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Marine stratus pushed into Puget Sound this morning
(which kept the region cool overnight/this morning). Cloud cover
is still expected to erode late this morning and afternoon as high
pressure builds into the region. For details on upcoming heat and
fire weather concerns (along with a refreshed aviation
discussion), please see details below.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The upper level trough
that produced a few showers and isolated thunderstorms over the
Cascades is continuing to progress eastward over eastern Oregon
this morning. An upper level ridge poised just offshore will begin
to rebuild over Western Washington today. Low level onshore flow
will turn more northerly by this afternoon and that will help
erode what`s left of the marine layer for mostly sunny skies
across the area by afternoon. Thermally induced low pressure at
the surface expanding northward along the Oregon coast will reach
the Washington coast on Wednesday turning the low level flow
offshore. Combined with 500 millibar heights at or above 590 dam
and 850 millibar temperatures of 20-22 C, we`ll see a significant
jump in high temperatures on Wednesday. Coastal locations will
likely see 80+ degrees with upper 70s to mid 80s across the
interior lowlands away from the water.

By late Thursday morning, models keep the thermal trough axis near
or just east of the immediate coast. Coastal areas will likely see
another very warm day in the mid or upper 80s before the sea
breeze kicks late in the day. Interior areas will be warmer as
well with highs ranging from the lower 80s north to lower 90s
across the Southwest Interior.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...The thermal trough will
shift inland to the interior lowlands on Friday and the upper
ridge will weaken somewhat as it shifts east of the Cascades.
Highs on Friday will likely be some 15 to 20 degrees cooler along
the coast, but we`ll see another unseasonably warm day inland.

The upper level ridge will progressively weaken heading into the
weekend with models maintaining good agreement that broad
troughing will take up residence offshore Sunday into Monday. A
subtle upper level disturbance might kick off some convection over
the Cascades late Saturday into Sunday, but confidence in how
that might ultimately play out is low. Nonetheless, a cooling
trend looks assured. A weak front may introduce the possibility of
a few showers over the Olympic Peninsula by Monday...in what
looks to be a pattern shift that resembles the early signs of
autumn. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow aloft will continue through today as
an upper ridge builds off the coast. Widespread MVFR/IFR cigs with
stratus across Western Washington this morning. Stratus will
generally improve between 19-22z with VFR mid level clouds lingering
this afternoon and evening. Lower cigs may continue along the coast
through later this afternoon, although some improvements to VFR are
possible. Cigs may lower again into the Strait of Juan de Fuca as
well as the coast later tonight into Wednesday morning, with perhaps
patchy low cigs in the interior. Light winds this morning will
increase from N/NW this afternoon.

KSEA...MVFR cigs will continue this morning with improvements to VFR
generally between 20-21z. VFR mid level clouds lingering into this
afternoon with VFR into tonight. Light south winds this morning will
transition NW this afternoon and become N/NE later this evening,
generally ranging 5 to 8 kts. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...An onshore flow pattern will continue today, however
speeds continue to ease for most interior waters and the inner
coastal. Outer coastal waters are a little elevated, but still
well below any headline criteria.

A thermally induced trough will extend northward along the coast for
Wednesday, allowing for flow to transition to offshore and then
persist through Thursday. The trough will move inland on Friday,
allowing for high pressure over the northeastern Pacific to build
back into the coastal waters and for flow to transition back to
onshore.

Seas are generally hovering between 4-6 ft across the coastal waters
today before subsiding to 3-5 ft by midweek. Seas are expected to
build again, this time reaching 5-7 ft on Thursday and Friday.

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Not much in the way of fire weather concerns
today as onshore flow persists...albeit a little weaker than
yesterday.

Warmer and drier conditions will return by mid week as upper level
ridging gives rise to a thermal pressure trough at the surface. This
will make for easterly winds as well as dry and unstable conditions
over portions of the area. While not much speed is expected with
these easterlies, notable gap locations will see increased speeds
and possibly occasional gusts. At this time, the expectation is that
these speeds will fall short of any critical fire weather
thresholds. However, the forecast is putting mid-level Haines values
of 5 and 6 over portions of the interior Thursday. This instability
coupled with daytime highs in the upper 80s to lower 90s suggest
that Dry and Unstable Red Flag conditions may be possible and will
be watching this time frame for any potential headlines with the
highest concern being the Cascades.
