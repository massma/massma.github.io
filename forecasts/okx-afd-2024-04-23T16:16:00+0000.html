Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
1216 PM EDT Tue Apr 23 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure over the area will weaken this afternoon as a
frontal system approaches from the west. The frontal system will
then move across the area Wednesday morning and afternoon.
Strong high pressure will build in from late Wednesday into
Thursday, remain over the region Thursday night and Friday, and
move offshore Friday night into Saturday. A warm front may lift
through Saturday night into Sunday, as an associated low over
the Great Lakes moves slowly eastward through early next week.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Forecast remains on track this afternoon. High pressure
continues to weaken and give way to an increasing onshore flow.
Skies will remain mostly clear for the rest of the afternoon
with some high clouds increasing from the west late. S flow
will continue to become gusty into the afternoon, strongest near
the coast. Temps along the coast may not be much different than
those of yesterday as a result, with highs 55-60, but temps
inland should be a little warmer, the 60-65 expected from
interior S CT across the Hudson Valley into NYC and NE NJ.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH THURSDAY/...
Clouds should increase tonight as the frontal system approaches,
with a leading warm front bringing a chance of showers late
mainly to Orange County. S flow will continue, with lows from
the upper 30s across SE CT and ern Long Island, to the 40s most
elsewhere, to near 50 in midtown NYC.

The chance of showers will expand to cover the entire area,
first in the morning with the leading warm front, then in the
afternoon especially inland with the cold fropa. Fcst soundings
show some sfc-based instability, but do not expect thunder given
a mid level cap keeping the instability from reaching levels
colder than -10C. That said, a few showers could still produce
gusty winds to 35 mph given steep low level lapse rate and dry
sub-cloud air.

High temps on Wed will be limited to the upper 50s/lower
60s inland and out east, with mid/upper 60s for Long Island and
the NYC metro area.

Fropa Wed afternoon will be followed by a gusty W-NW flow
ushering in colder air for Wed night-Thu. Lows Wed night should
fall to the lower 40s in midtown NYC, with 30s most elsewhere
and upper 20s across the interior. Freeze conditions may once
again occur inland, all the way to the coast across SE CT, and
across the Long Island Pine Barrens, with upper 20s/lower 30s
expected. Highs on Thu should be in the lower/mid 50s, about
7-10 degrees below normal.

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
An Omega blocking pattern begins to set up Thursday night and
becomes established on Friday, as a deep trough remains across
eastern Canada into the northern Atlantic, with another trough
through the Rocky Mountain region into the Plains, and a high
amplitude ridge in between. As a result systems will be slow to
move eastward into the beginning of next week. And a northern
Plains low will be slow to move into the ridge Sunday into
Monday.

With surface high pressure over the region moving offshore
Friday night, there is a lot of uncertainty with the
development and movement of a warm front Saturday night into
Sunday, as ridging remains. Regardless of the warm front, a deep
return flow sets up for late in the upcoming weekend and
temperatures initially below normal through Saturday quickly
rise to as much as 10-15 degrees above normal Saturday night
into the beginning of next week. Used the NBM guidance through
the extended period. Frost headlines may once again be needed
for the inland areas Thursday night and Friday night.

&&

.AVIATION /16Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
Weak off shore high pressure weakens today as a frontal system
slowly approaches from the Great Lakes through tonight.

VFR. A chance of showers late tonight/toward Wednesday morning.
There is a low chance, low confidence, of MVFR in the showers.

Light winds early this morning become southerly and increase
through midday. Gusts to around 20kt develop late morning, and
become more likely during the afternoon. Gusts may be
occasionally higher late this afternoon along the south shore of
Long Island. Southerly flow gradually weakens tonight.


 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Gusts may be more occasional, and more likely, and stronger,
late in the afternoon.


OUTLOOK FOR 12Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

Wednesday: VFR, a low chance of MVFR in showers, mainly in the
morning. SW winds 10-15G15-25kt, becoming W-NW in the afternoon,
then northerly late at night 5 to 10kt.

Thursday-Saturday: VFR.

forecasts, can be found at: https:/www.weather.gov/zny/n90

.MARINE...
Quiet cond to start will give way to a strengthening S flow this
afternoon and tonight. A southerly jet along the Jersey shore up
into the NY Bight and lower NY Bay will gust over 25 kt, so SCA
continues there. SCA cond should expand eastward later tonight
into Wed, with gusts up to 25 kt and seas 4-7 ft.

W-NW flow following cold fropa Wed afternoon will likely gust
to 25-30 kt on all waters from late day Wed into Wed night.
Extended SCA only for the ocean waters into this time frame for
now.

With high pressure in control Thursday night into Saturday,
moving offshore Saturday night, winds and seas across the
forecast waters should then remain below advisory levels.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued an SPS for Lower Hudson Valley of NY for elevated fire
spread this afternoon given combo of min RH 25-30 percent and S
winds gusting to around 20 mph.

SPS for NE NJ remains for elevated fire growth potential given
combo of min RH 25-30 percent, S winds gusting to 20-25 mph, and
drying fuels, for this afternoon until around sunset.

A similar combo will be in place across the rest of the NYC
metro area, much of the lower Hudson Vally, and interior S CT
along the I-84 corridor.

After a cold frontal passage Wed afternoon, cond may be even
more conducive for fire growth in the NYC metro area and NE NJ
given similar RH and W-NW winds gusting to 25-30 mph. This will
depend on how quickly RH drop and whether wetting rains occur
ahead of and with the frontal passage.

.HYDROLOGY...
No hydrologic concerns through the upcoming weekend.
