Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
227 PM PDT Sun Jul 28 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A wet weather system will move across the region
Monday into early Tuesday bringing cooler temperatures and rain
to the region. Showers will taper off through Tuesday. Drier
conditions and a warming trend are then expected through the rest
of the week, remaining well above normal into the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Marine layer stratus
continues to burn off this afternoon and temperatures are slowly
rising where clearing is occurring. Increasing high cirrus is
likely as we get later into the afternoon and evening ahead of a
wet (for July) weather system.

That frontal system will begin to spread precipitation across the
coast late this evening and into the Puget Sound region early
Monday morning. This will likely result in slick commute
conditions across western Washington due to oil buildup and the
lack of recent rain. Precipitation totals over 0.50 inches are
possible along the Pacific coast as well as portions of the west
slopes of the Cascades. Lesser amounts of a few hundredths to a
quarter of an inch are possible for much of the greater Seattle
metro area down through Lewis County. Precipitation will become
showery and mainly limited to the mountains Tuesday as the system
progresses east.

By Wednesday, dry conditions are expected area wide as ridging
begins to fight against a wave moving though northern BC.
Temperatures are expected to rebound to the upper 70s to low 80s.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...By Thursday and Friday,
large scale ridging builds across the western CONUS allowing
temperatures to continue to warm reaching the 80s to around 90 in
the lowlands of western Washington by Friday afternoon. Details of
the pattern evolution over the weekend are still somewhat
uncertain. Additional dramatic warming appears unlikely, but
temperatures hovering in the 80s to low 90s is likely. Looking out
a bit further, above normal temperatures are favored into the
following week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West-northwest flow aloft with broad upper-level
troughing overhead. Marine stratus has been slow to burn off this
afternoon but current satellite is showing improvement across the
interior at this time. Any areas that should see improvement will
only be brief with more stratus (MVFR to IFR) arriving overnight
into Monday morning along with light rain showers with little to no
improvement expected during the day on Monday.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings currently over the terminal but improvement to
VFR should be met within the next hour or two. A brief spell of VFR
conditions are expected this evening but MVFR stratus are to rebound
by 08-10z Monday and remain throughout the day. Southwesterly winds
5 to 10 knots through majority of the TAF period.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure remains offshore with lower
pressure inland. A frontal boundary will cross the marine zones on
Monday with showers but no advisory/warning level winds are
expected. High pressure is expected to build over the coastal waters
during the second half of the week. Coastal seas 3 to 5 feet will
persist for the next several days.

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Benign fire weather conditions are expected for the
next few days. A front will enter and bring widespread rainfall
starting overnight tonight at the coast before spreading inland into
the day on Monday. Wetting rain (>=0.25") is possible for W WA
through Monday with the mountains likely to see the best chance
where up to 0.50-1.50" is expected for the Olympics and Cascades.
Locally higher amounts are possible. Conditions will then trend
drier as the week progress with upper-level ridging becoming more
prominent around Thursday-Friday. Here we could see above average
temperatures along with the possibility for critical RH values and
the threat for instability by the week`s end.
