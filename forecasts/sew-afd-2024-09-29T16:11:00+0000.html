Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
911 AM PDT Sun Sep 29 2024


.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Current temperatures are in the 40s and 50s across W WA.
Conditions are dry as of now but showers (15-30% chance) are
possible throughout today, mainly for the northern half of the
CWA. No changes made to the inherited forecast as the previous
discussion remains below along with an updated aviation section.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...A subtle trough will enter western Washington today
increasing precipitation chances along the Canadian border and in
the Cascades, but little impact elsewhere. Upper level ridging
starts the new week off dry, however a series of troughs starting
Tuesday will influence the pattern. A more organized frontal system
looks to arrive on Friday.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Current IR satellite showing
clouds moving into W WA this morning, although impact will be
dependent on location: the northern half of the Olympic Peninsula
has either clear skies or some high clouds, the southern half a mix
of high and low clouds with some clear spots, east of the Sound from
Snohomish county south seeing low to midlevel clouds socking in the
area and lastly, Skagit and Whatcom counties are generally clear in
their western halves with clouds in place over the Cascades. All of
this thanks to a weak upper level trough passing through the area
this morning. Forecast expectation is that there will be some low-
end PoPs as this feature passes through...mainly focused over the
Cascades and northern portions of the area. Current radar loop
supports this, showing a line of weak echoes developing over central
Skagit and perhaps even drooping down into north-central Snohomish.
This would be slightly further south than most progs hinted at, but
given that this development really does not gel together until the
start of more complex topography, can likely just lump this is with
the PoPs associated with the Cascades. This feature will not linger
terribly long, with any impacts wrapped up by late tonight/early
Monday morning.

Upper level ridging will bring a dry Monday, but this ridge will
flatten throughout the day ahead of a dissipating front associated
with low pressure over the Gulf of Alaska. Deterministic models in
some disagreement here as the ECMWF keeps the feature together long
enough for PoPs, albeit low ones, to emerge throughout the day
Tuesday while the GFS completely scuttles the feature. Ensembles in
general agreement with a trend that seems the most likely, that
being low PoPs and even lower QPF for the northern half of the CWA
while points from Everett south will likely remain dry...yet cloudy.
The forecast splits the difference here with widespread low-end PoPs
for much of the area /barely topping 30 pct/, aside from the
northern tied and two-thirds of the Cascades, where 40-50 pct PoPs
are present. To offset this, QPF values throughout the area are
minute with only a few hundredths expected for those locations that
do see precip.

Daytime highs today running pretty similar to yesterday with most
spots in the upper 50s to lower 60s. The upper ridge Monday however
will give temps a bit of a boost with most lowland locations falling
in the 60s and the prospect for some locations in the SW interior to
get close to 70. Overnight lows will retain their autumn-like
nature, with lower to mid 40s expected tonight, then a little warmer
Monday night and Tuesday night being in the mid to upper 40s in most
spots.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Generally dry conditions
Wednesday and Thursday as upper level ridging moves into the area,
however another low over the Gulf of Alaska will move eastward and
fizzle out. While portions of its associated front may bring some
very slight PoPs to the very northernmost reaches of the area,
likely not sinking any further south than Bellingham, overall the
precip threat is minimal. Models remain consistent in bringing in a
frontal system to W WA Friday, however latest runs look less and
less convincing...suggesting this will also suffer the same fate as
systems already mentioned in this discussion...mainly fizzling out
either near or over the CWA. Not quite ready to bite onto this
solution just yet as this is a fairly recent development. Will be
more willing to chew it over if this solution is present again in 24
hours. Ensembles, however, remain consistent suggesting some precip
for much of the area...granted expected amounts are a tenth of an
inch or less. A return to upper level ridging will wrap up the
forecast period with dry conditions.

Temps remain fairly static throughout the long term with daytime
highs returning to the lower to mid 60s and overnight lows mostly in
the upper 40s to lower 50s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West to southwesterly flow aloft will become
northwesterly late today as an upper trough axis shifts east of the
Cascades. Low level onshore flow continues near the surface this
morning. Areas of MVFR ceilings have improved thus far to VFR and
will continue to hold throughout the TAF period. The low level flow
will turn northerly  early this afternoon into tonight.

KSEA...VFR at the terminal this morning with additional scattering
expected. Surface winds southerly 7 to 11 knots will veer
north/northeast after 21Z. 27/Kristell<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow continues this morning as a surface
ridge expands into the coastal waters. This will likely keep
small craft advisory westerlies going a little longer in the
central/east strait and have opted to extend the advisory
into late this morning. The ridge will shift onshore tonight
turning the low level flow more northerly. Thermally induced low
pressure expanding northward along the Oregon coast on Monday will
turn the flow weakly offshore at times. Onshore flow resumes on
Tuesday as a weak front dissipates over the coastal waters with
little to no impact. Some degree of onshore flow continues into
midweek as surface ridging remains poised offshore with lower
pressure east of the Cascades. Hazardous double digit seas are
expected to reach the coastal waters later Tuesday into Wednesday as
the result of a deep surface low passing well north of the area in
the Gulf of Alaska.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
