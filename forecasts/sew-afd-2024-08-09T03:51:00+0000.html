Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
851 PM PDT Thu Aug 8 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Temperatures will continue to warm well above normal
through Friday before some cooling over the weekend. Areas of
lofted smoke and haze are still expected into the weekend with
mid-level east flow. A chance of isolated thunderstorms remains
over the mountains each afternoon through Saturday, with the best
potential existing on Friday. Onshore flow will bring cooler
conditions into the beginning of next week.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The forecast remains on
track this evening with very warm temperatures across Western
Washington today despite the widespread haze from smoke across the
region. No changes to the ongoing heat advisories, with the
Southwest Interior and Lower Chehalis zones expiring at 9 PM. These
locales will see more significant cooling tonight than deeper
into the interior, where the advisory will continue for another
day. No other updates needed this evening, with the previous short
and long term sections following.                     Cullen

Recent satellite imagery shows clear skies over western Washington
this afternoon along with increased haze aloft, mostly Puget
Sound northward. This is mainly due to the increased easterly flow
at 850-925mb, which will help warm temperatures through this
afternoon. Uncertainty still exists in how much temperatures will
warm up in the interior due to the haze aloft. As of right now,
temperatures are on track to warm into the mid to upper 80s across
the interior, with coastal areas in the low to mid 70s. Overnight
lows look to be in the mid 60s, but once again, these may fluctuate,
depending on haze aloft.

A similar forecast is in store for Friday, although temperatures
will warm up slightly throughout most of the interior with haze
lingering through the area. HeatRisk levels on Friday are mostly
widespread Moderate values across western Washington, with some
localized pockets of Major Heatrisk, mainly located in the Cascade
Foothills and few parts of metro areas. A heat advisory will
still continue for most of western through Friday for this reason.
There`s also the uncertainty of overnight lows, that will likely
sit in the low to mid 60s across much of the interior.

There is a continued threat for isolated thunderstorms over the
next couple of afternoon/evenings, especially over the Northern
Cascades. Latest guidance suggests Friday is expected to have the
highest potential for thunderstorms in the North Cascades. There
is also a slight chance of thunderstorm activity in the Olympics.
These thunderstorms may lead to an increased fire weather risk,
especially regarding lightning. See the fire weather section for
additional details.

Increasing onshore flow on Saturday will bring cooler temps
to much of western Washington as high temperatures across the
area generally range in the low to mid 80s - with haze getting
scoured out into Sunday. Highs on Sunday will only reach the mid
70s, providing relief to much of the area.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Offshore troughing looks to
influence the long term period, allowing for a general cooler
trend through much of the week. Uncertainty does exist on the
extent of the troughing, but ensembles and CPC generally agree
with below average temperatures across western Washington.
Increased onshore flow and increased cloud cover look to be the
likely scenario during this time.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West to northwesterly flow aloft as a weak upper level
trough approaches W WA with flow turning more westerly Friday.

VFR conditions in place over W WA this this evening with marine
stratus present over the Pacific waters. These stratus are expected
to start moving onto the coast tonight and push in as far east as
SHN overnight. This will result in MVFR to IFR cigs in these
locations. Otherwise, VFR conditions likely to persist for the
entire TAF period, however it is worth noting that some haze will be
present again Friday morning and afternoon due to smoke from nearby
wildfires which may cause small reductions in visibility from time
to time.

KSEA...VFR conditions in place and expected to remain that way for
the TAF period. There is a 10-15% chance of the above mentioned
stratus making it to the terminal between 12-16z. Obviously, with
percentages that low, highly doubtful this will occur but if it
should, any stratus should clear out by 18z. Northerly winds this
evening generally 6 to 12 kts before easing to 3 to 8 kts overnight.
Winds shifting more west to northwesterly Friday morning with speeds
remaining light.

.MARINE...High pressure remains offshore this week with persistent
west or northwest winds over the coastal water and westerly winds
through Strait of Juan de Fuca with diurnal increases during the
afternoon and evening hours. However, winds are currently expected
to remain below advisory thresholds through the first half of next
week. Seas over the coastal waters will remain rather steep with
dominant period around 8 seconds. Combined seas generally 5 to 7
feet, largest over the waters beyond 20 nm from shore.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...Upper level ridging situated over northern Canada
will continue to bring warm temperatures and generally drier
conditions to the region into Friday. Weak offshore flow will
continue in the Cascade valleys through Friday morning and could
continue to bring isolated pockets of lower RHs, along with
unstable conditions.

An upper level shortwave trough will brush Washington to the
north and will bring increasing instability to the region on
Friday afternoon and evening. Latest thunderstorm probabilities
continue to indicate around a 20-30% chance of convection across
the Cascades and 10-20% chance of convection across the Olympics.
Not much in the way of precipitation is expected with any
thunderstorms that initially develop along the western slopes of
the Cascades on Friday afternoon. Chances of a wetting rain
generally remain at 10% or less. Thus, any lightning strikes that
occur could spark new fires across the region. A Red Flag Warning
has been issued for the North Cascades zone of 658 for thunderstorms
and gusty outflow winds through Friday evening.

A threat for thunderstorms remains across the North Cascades on
Saturday afternoon and evening, however chances will wane as the
shortwave moves to the east. 14
