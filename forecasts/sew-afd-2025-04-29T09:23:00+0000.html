Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
223 AM PDT Tue Apr 29 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cool and showery conditions are expected to linger
through this morning. Drier and warmer weather returns for
Wednesday and Thursday. Precipitation chances are back in the
forecast for Friday into next weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light rain is still
progressing through western Washington early this morning. Over
the last 6 to 12 hours, only a few hundredths of an inch have
fallen throughout Puget Sound, with slightly over a quarter of an
inch along the coast and through the San Juan Islands. These
showers will linger through much of the morning before tapering
off. Some may still be ongoing at times for the rest of the day in
the Cascades. Highs today are expected to be in the upper 50s and
low 60s.

A ridge returns over the northeastern Pacific Wednesday into
Thursday for dry and warm weather. Highs on Wednesday will climb
into the mid to upper 60s and steadily higher yet on Thursday,
with highs in the mid to upper 70s. 80 degree temperatures are
likely in Cascade valleys and into the Southwest Interior.
For this time of year, temperatures reaching near 80 degrees does
put much of Puget Sound in the minor (yellow) HeatRisk category.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Another warm day (although
slightly less than Thursday) is expected on Friday. Pleasant
temperatures in the low 70s are expected, with upper 50s along the
coast. While the forecast has some light precipitation in for
Friday afternoon, at this point, it seems more showery and not
widespread. The timing of the next system has been pushed back,
with the track of the low and associated frontal system not
nearing the region until closer to early Saturday morning. The
core of the low pressure system seems to track into northern
California, for light rain to return in a more widespread fashion
on Saturday. QPF amounts will be light again, with about a quarter
of an inch favored in the Cascades.

Precipitation looks to taper off on Sunday, with split flow aloft
bringing mild conditions back through Monday.

afternoon as a weak upper trough and associated frontal system
move east of the area. Widespread MVFR and pockets of IFR in
light rain will persist through mid-morning. Precipitation will
diminish by late morning with ceilings lifting to VFR most areas
after 21Z. Increasing onshore flow behind the front later this
morning will lead to gusty surface winds at times coast and Strait
of Juan de Fuca through the afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak frontal system will move inland this morning
with onshore flow briefly increasing behind it as surface ridging
rebuilds across the coastal and offshore waters. The ridge will
remain in place over the coastal waters into Thursday producing
light onshore flow. A weak front will reach the waters at the end of
the week with possible wind-related headlines mainly for the coastal
waters. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
