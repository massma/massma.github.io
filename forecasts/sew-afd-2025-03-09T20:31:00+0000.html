Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
131 PM PDT Sun Mar 9 2025

.SYNOPSIS...A weak atmospheric river will sag south over the area
then dissipate tonight as cold front moves through the area. The
next weather system will arrive late Tuesday. A cool upper level
trough will be over Western Washington Wednesday into Thursday.
Another weather system will arrive at the end of the week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Gusty southerlies
continue across much of the area early this afternoon as rain
associated with a cold front spreads inland. The frontal
signature is pretty evident on radar with its rope-like appearance
and was crossing the central coast as of 19Z. It`ll be a soggy
afternoon and evening ahead, but winds should ease relatively
quickly for most areas behind the front this evening. Several
inches of snow will quickly accumulate with and just behind the
front at Mount Baker and Stevens Pass where a winter weather
advisory remains in effect. A brief post-frontal convergence zone
is expected over Snohomish and King counties 00Z-06Z. An upper
trough axis will shift east of the Cascades tonight with just a
few mainly mountain showers lingering into Monday under general
zonal flow aloft.

The next system will dig offshore during the day on Tuesday with
perhaps a few showers across the coast and Olympic Peninsula, but
interior areas look to be generally dry through much of the day.
Models are trending weaker with the associated surface low with
this system making wind-related impacts less likely for the coast
and North Interior. Nonetheless, another frontal system will move
inland Tuesday night into Wednesday morning with another round of
lowland rain, mountain snow, and breezy to locally windy
conditions.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Upper troughing remains
over the area on Thursday for cool, showery conditions. Current
prospects for viewing Thursday night`s total lunar eclipse don`t
look especially promising, but there might be some glimpses for
some between showers. The next in a series of systems is slated to
arrive later on Friday into Saturday. It doesn`t look especially
strong as better jet support will be well south of the area.
However, snow levels passes will remain below pass levels for the
second half of the week with periods of snow impacting weekend
travelers over the Cascades.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...Southwesterly flow aloft as a front spreads through
the region this afternoon. A mixed bag of ceilings out there as
rain gradually arrives at area terminals, with generally MVFR/IFR
across coastal terminals. Ceilings will be begin to lower to MVFR as
rain approaches the interior, with some localized spots of IFR
possible especially in lower prone terminals. Rain will continue
throughout the rest of the evening as MVFR conditions will likely
persist into early Monday morning as lingering moisture remains.
Southerly winds have increased this afternoon generally sustained
at 15 to 20 kts, with gusts up to 25 to 35 kts. The strongest
gusts (30-35 kts) will be centered near KBLI and northern
terminals.

Southerly winds will turn more westerly/southwesterly around
20-22z and will decrease to around 5 to 10 knots, generally
remaining light into the overnight hours.

KSEA...VFR conditions this afternoon as rain nears the vicinity
of the terminal. Rain looks to reach the terminal around 22z-00z
with ceilings decreasing to MVFR. MVFR conditions look to remain
into the overnight and into early Monday morning before gradually
lifting back to VFR. Breezy southerly winds 15 to 18 kts with
gusts up to 25 to 30 kts will continue through the afternoon hours
before switching southwesterly and decreasing to around 5 to 10
knots. Winds will become light into Monday morning.

.MARINE...A front will continue to make its way over the coastal
waters this afternoon, bringing elevated winds and limited
visibilities. Southerly winds over the waters will quickly change
to southwesterly later this afternoon. A Small Craft Advisory has
been issued for the Central and Eastern Entrance of the Strait of
Juan De Fuca for a westerly push that will last through this
evening. Elevated seas will continue over the coastal waters, so
the Small Craft Advisory remains.

High pressure looks to quickly build offshore Monday for a brief
lull in the weather, before another frontal system looks to
develop near the coastal waters late Tuesday into Wednesday. The
aforementioned low pressure system could have the potential to
bring another round of breezy winds and elevated seas to the area
waters, with the marine pattern remaining active throughout the
week.

Coastal seas this afternoon 9 to 13 feet will start to decrease
under 10 feet by Monday afternoon. Seas will remain steady until
Tuesday night where seas will increase to around 10 to 13 feet.
Seas look to remain around 10 feet through the end of the week.

.HYDROLOGY...No river flooding in the next 7 days. The Skokomish
