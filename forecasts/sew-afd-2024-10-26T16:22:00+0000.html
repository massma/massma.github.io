Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
922 AM PDT Sat Oct 26 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Scattered showers will persist throughout the day.
Another front will bring more widespread rain and breezy conditions
again tonight into Sunday. Unstable conditions will allow for a
chance of thunderstorms on Sunday and snow levels will fall low
enough for mountain snow. A brief break is possible late Monday and
part of Tuesday before another system looks to bring another round
of rain and mountain snow mid-week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A few showers continue
across the area this morning in the wake of a frontal system that
swept onshore overnight. The next front will spread another round of
rain onshore by this evening. QPF with this next front will be more
substantial, but the progressive nature of it will limit any
potential hydro impacts. Breezy winds will accompany this front as
well, but speeds are anticipated to stay below wind advisory
thresholds at this time. A cooler, more unstable air mass will
follow the front with snow levels falling to the highest passes
Sunday night into early Monday. Current forecasts have trends
covered and no public forecast updates needed this morning. Previous
forecast discussion follows with updates to marine/aviation
portions.   27

Radar imagery shows widespread rain across western Washington this
morning associated with a low pressure system centered just
offshore, tracking northwestward towards Vancouver Island. This
system is being supported in the upper levels by a shortwave impulse
rotating around a large closed low centered over the Gulf of Alaska.
South to southeasterly winds will remain gusty this morning, with
sustained winds 20 to 30 mph with gusts up to 45 to 55 mph along the
Pacific Coast and areas around Whidbey Island northward through the
San Juan Islands, including western Whatcom and Skagit counties.
Elsewhere, winds look to top out to 15 to 20 mph with gusts 25 to 30
kt. Winds will back off later this morning as the surface trough
moves through the area. Additionally, widespread rain will devolve
into scattered showers. Temperatures are currently quite mild across
the area, with temperatures ranging from the upper 40s to near 60.
Temperatures should largely remain steady through most of the day,
with high temperatures around 60.

Another cold front will pass through the area overnight tonight into
Sunday for another round of substantial rainfall and somewhat
breezy winds. Winds look to be weaker compared to this morning as
the parent low center remains well to the north near Haida Gwaii.
The airmass will be unstable with upper-level support, allowing for
the potential for scattered thunderstorm development. Chances will
be best over the coastal waters and on the Pacific Coast. Lightning
and perhaps some small graupel/hail will be the main impacts from
thunderstorms that develop. Snow levels will be high initially, but
will lower to around 4500-5000 ft on Sunday. Chances for showers
continue throughout the day on Sunday and into Monday as the surface
low tracks south towards the region and the associated upper-level
trough digs southeastward into the area. With this, the airmass will
slowly cool, allowing snow levels to continue to slowly lower,
reaching 3500-4000 ft by Monday. This will allow for some light snow
showers and a few inches of accumulating snow at the higher passes
(including White Pass and Washington Pass). Accumulations are
currently appear minimal below 4000 ft through Monday.

Through Monday, from 0.75 to 1.25 inches of rain is expected through
the interior, 2 to 2.5 inches along the Pacific Coast, and 2.5 to 4
inches expected through the mountains, with amounts highest in the
North Cascades and the windward side of the Olympics. Locally higher
amounts are possible.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...A transient ridge will allow
conditions to dry out a bit Tuesday morning before the next system
will approach the region Wednesday into Thursday. Snow levels look
to be lower with this system (2500-3000 ft), allowing for the
potential for more significant accumulating snow at the mountain
passes. Specifics on precipitation amounts at this time are
uncertain as there are discrepancies on the evolution of the system.
With continued upper-level troughing, temperatures look to remain on
the cooler side, with highs in the lower 50s and lows in the upper
30s to lower 40s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft will persist through the TAF
period as a deep upper level low sinks southward over the NE
Pacific. Winds will gradually ease through the morning hours, but
will increase again late this afternoon and evening ahead of the
next approaching frontal system. Conditions will generally remain
VFR to MVFR across the region through much of the day, with local
IFR/MVFR conditions more prevalent in rain showers this morning.
Scattered showers will continue through much of the day, before
another round of more widespread rain moves inland tonight with
lowering ceilings, restricted visibility in rain, and a return of
gusty winds.

KSEA...Another round of showers across the terminal area through
19z, with south/southeast surface winds 7-9 kt and ceilings trending
closer to MVFR in these showers. Otherwise, scattered showers later
today with predominant ceilings around 3000 ft. Expect southerly
winds to again increase overnight with gusts to 25 kt and steadier
rain which likely brings MVFR ceilings and reduced visibility. Winds
begin to ease after daybreak Sunday but remain gusty through the day.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Winds are easing in between frontal systems this morning,
but will again increase across the coastal waters and northern
interior waters this afternoon and evening ahead of the next front.
Seas peaked around 17-20 ft this morning over the coastal waters and
will gradually subside through the day today. Another increase to a
similar range is expected again on Sunday.

The front on Sunday will likely bring another round of breezy winds
for the coast and north interior waters. The pattern will remain
active heading into next week as a strong low moves from the Gulf of
Alaska southward toward the region Monday before pushing onshore
into Oregon by Tuesday. High pressure then returns over the waters
Tuesday, but the next front quickly arrives into Wednesday. This
will maintain seas over the coastal waters generally above 10 ft
through much of the week, though a brief lull is possible early
Tuesday with the brief return of higher pressure.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...Several systems will track across western Washington,
with periods of showers with several frontal passages early this
morning, and again on Sunday, as well as another system mid-week.
Snow levels will start high today (7000-9000 ft), lowering from 5000
ft early Sunday to below 4000 ft on Monday. With 2 to 4 inches of
rain in the forecast across the Olympic and Cascade mountains,
significant rises are expected on area rivers. Currently no rivers
are forecasted to reach flood stage, but rivers will need to be
monitored, in particular the Skokomish, which is forecasted to reach
Action stage on Monday.
