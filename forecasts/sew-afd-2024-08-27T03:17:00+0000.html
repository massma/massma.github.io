.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A trough moving over western Washington will bring
showers and cooler temperatures to start the week. High pressure
will build into the region mid-week, allowing conditions to dry
out and warm up through the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Current radar shows rain
associated with an approaching front slowly creeping eastward over W
WA this evening. The leading edge of this precip at the time of this
writing /730 PM PDT/ extended southwestward from just west of Mt.
Baker to just east of Aberdeen. Last few frames of visible
satellite clearly show the back end of the front, which at its
furthest east is still over the nearshore waters. While there had
been a handful of isolated lightning strikes with this system
earlier in the afternoon, that activity has since disappeared...so
little concern for thunderstorms during the evening and overnight
hours as this continues to plod through the CWA. Radar estimated
rainfall rates remain pretty light. Some hints that higher elevation
could lead to increased rates due to topographical influence...but
the burn scars of most concern still some hours away from seeing
precip...thus likely not a concern for the evening weather watch.

Inherited forecast remains on track and see no need for any evening
updates. For more forecast details, please refer to the Previous
Discussion section below.

From Previous Discussion...A trough will continue to dig into the
Pacific Northwest today, ushering in clouds and shower activity with
a few embedded lightning strikes. The front will push a few rounds
of of showers across the region through the evening with most shower
activity west of the Cascades tapering off after midnight. Ensembles
favor the highest chance of lightning activity with this system over
the Olympics and North Cascades (10% to 15% probability). Breezy
winds will develop tonight as the front passes through, especially
through the Strait of Juan de Fuca and across the lowlands towards
the Canada border. High resolution models also show potential for
convergence zone shower activity developing east of the Puget Sound
early Tuesday morning, though the exact timing and placement is
uncertain. Precipitation across western Washington will end by
Tuesday afternoon as cool northwest flow develops aloft. Rainfall
accumulations will generally be light for the lowlands with totals
of less than a tenth of an inch, while the Cascades will see totals
approaching an inch through the morning hours. Despite clearing
skies on Tuesday, temperatures will top out roughly 10 degrees below
normal for the end of August with highs in the 60s across the
lowlands. Northerly flow at the surface will cool things down even
more heading into Wednesday morning, with lows bottoming out in the
mid 40s to mid 50s, which would be the coolest morning in Seattle in
over 2 months.

Upper level ridging will build into western Washington on
Wednesday and Thursday, allowing temperatures to slowly rebound
and conditions to dry out. High pressure will maintain mostly
clear skies as highs return to near normal in the mid to upper
70s across the lowlands by Thursday.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...From Previous
Discussion...Ensembles show good agreement over the extended
forecast, favoring above-normal temperatures and dry conditions
across western Washington as high pressure builds over the western
US. Low level flow will turn offshore late Thursday into Friday as a
thermally induced surface trough develops along the Pacific coast,
allowing for continued warming across western Washington and a
return of summer- like temperatures just in time for the holiday
weekend. Warming will continue into Saturday as a weak trough
develops to the south offshore. Forecast models are in good
agreement over this feature, but uncertainty still remains over the
intensity and placement of this low pressure system. Upper and mid
level moisture will likely increase as a result towards the end of
the weekend, which may lower temperatures and allow for isolated
shower and thunder activity to form over higher terrain, but
confidence is low at this time.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough of low pressure will
push across Western Washington through the period. Initially the
flow will begin southwesterly, but shift more westerly and then
northwesterly on Tuesday as the low pressure passes through the
area.

Light rain will accompany the low pressure system overnight and into
early Tuesday. Conditions generally in the VFR range will lower to
MVFR with the passage of the system through the 15-18z Tuesday
timeframe. Briefly passing heavier showers will create some short
lived IFR conditions but otherwise generally MVFR cigs/vsby
expected. After 15-18Z Tue, expect VFR conditions to return. Winds
will be generally southwesterly 5-10 knots to start the period but
expect them to increase a bit after 07Z Tue as the system
approaches. Winds of 8-12 knots with some gusts over 15 kts appear
likely as the winds shift northwesterly on Tuesday.

KSEA...Light rain showers will impact the terminal overnight but
cigs and vsby should generally remain MVFR after 06-09Z. SW winds of
4-8kts this evening will increase to 8-12kts after 08z and become
gusty to 15kts. Winds will become more westerly to northwesterly
Tuesday after 15Z. VFR conditions will also return after this time
period. Expect decreasing winds by the end of the period.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system will sweep over the coastal waters
tonight. Strong post-frontal northwest winds will push across the
coastal waters, resulting in small craft advisories over all of the
coastal water zones. Along with post frontal winds, onshore flow
will increase through the Strait of Juan De Fuca for small craft
advisory westerlies this evening. Latest guidance continues to
indicate brief gusts potentially up to Gale Force in the East
Entrance Tuesday morning (30 to 40%).

Coastal seas 3 to 5 feet this afternoon building upwards to around 7
to 8 feet this evening. Combined with gusty northwest winds, seas
will likely become choppy, especially over the outer coastal waters.

High pressure will begin to rebuild offshore with lower pressure
inland, resulting in a more typical summerlike pattern for the rest
of the week, with diurnally driven onshore flow.
