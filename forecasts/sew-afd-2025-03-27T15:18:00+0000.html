Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
818 AM PDT Thu Mar 27 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Upper level low remaining off the coast into Friday
keeping showers in the forecast. Low weakening to an upper level
trough and moving inland Friday night. Next system arriving late
in the weekend. Another upper level low off the coast for the
first part of next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No major forecast updates
have been made this morning. The rest of the previous discussion
is valid. See below for an update to the aviation and marine
segments.

A deep, stacked, low continues to spin offshore, with moist S/SW
flow across western WA. Still seeing plenty of showers across the
region this morning with light to moderate precipitation. The air
mass remains slightly unstable today with isolated thunderstorms
possible, however, the highest threat is east of the Cascades.
Winds will be breezy along the coast and north interior with S/SE
gusts to 30-40 mph.

Showers will continue tonight into Friday with a focus for
heavier precipitation along the coast and Olympics, aided by a
trough axis. This may result in renewed flooding of the Skokomish
River and a Flood Watch remains in effect for Mason County.

Troughing over the region keeps the air mass cool and showery
moving into the weekend. On Saturday, snow levels will drop to
around 3000 ft with light snow in the mountains and passes.
Temperatures return to normal with lows in the 40s and highs in
the low to mid 50s. 33

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Weak upper level ridging
will bring a brief break to the weather on Sunday. Morning lows
will be cooler and in the 30s. Highs may reach the lower 60s in
the interior. More wet weather is headed our way early next week
as low pressure shifts inland. The mountains will see a few more
inches of snow with snow levels hovering around 3000 ft. A trough
digs offshore toward midweek, then shifts inland, thus keeping
rain in the forecast throughout. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>South-southwesterly flow aloft throughout the TAF
period. At the surface, winds generally out of the south-southeast
as a low spins offshore. Speeds 6-12 kt area-wide with gusts near 20-
25 kt for terminals such as KHQM and KBLI. Showers are in the
forecast today as a mix of VFR/MVFR will start things off. Some
isolated pockets of patchy fog have developed as well, and may
affect isolated areas and terminals (expect burn off late this
morning). Conditions will trend mostly VFR as the day progress but
can`t rule out instances of MVFR under heavier showers. The trend
will likely persist overnight into early Friday.

KSEA...VFR currently as showers push overhead. Some patchy fog in
the vicinity developed around the terminal (particularly up at
KBFI), can`t rule out a brief visibility reduction this morning (but
the risk is too low to put in the morning TAF update). The VFR
conditions will prevail throughout much of the upcoming TAF period.
Can`t rule out brief instances of MVFR cigs/vis under heavier
showers. S-SE winds between 5-10 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>980 mb surface low continues offshore with inclement
conditions. Gales will go into effect this morning and remain into
tonight over the coastal waters. In addition, an SCA will go into
effect for East Entrance this morning through at least Friday. More
SCAs may be needed for neighboring waters such as the Northern
Inland zone tonight into Friday. Weak upper level ridge building
over the waters Saturday-Saturday night with winds easing. Next
surface low associated with the negatively tilted trough late in the
weekend staying well offshore. Seas building into the 12 to 15 foot
range today will subside to near 10 feet Friday night and Saturday.
Seas continuing to subside Sunday into Monday.

.HYDROLOGY...Precipitation will continue into the first part of
next week with Sunday looking like the only dry day at this time.
The precipitation is not expected to cause significant rises to
area rivers.

The exception is the Skokomish River, where heavy showers are
favored to bring the Skokomish into flood stage by late Thursday
evening. The river will crest near moderate flood stage Friday and
remain over flood stage into Saturday. Large uncertainty exists
over the amount of precipitation over the basin. Conditions will
continue to be closely monitored.
