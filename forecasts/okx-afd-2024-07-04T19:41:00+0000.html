Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
341 PM EDT Thu Jul 4 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A trough of low pressure stalls over the area tonight with a warm
front lifting through the region during Friday into Friday night. A
cold front then approaches on Saturday, slowly moving through the
area Saturday night. The front stalls just southeast of the area
Sunday into Monday as weak high pressure builds into the area. The
front may then lift back to the north Monday night into Tuesday
ahead of another frontal system working east across the Great Lakes
and Ohio Valley states.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM FRIDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A trough of low pressure stalls over us tonight with shortwave lift
slowly shifting through. Ahead of this, sea breeze boundaries will
act as other sources of low level moisture convergence. Scattered
showers and thunderstorms will continue into tonight with SBCAPEs
starting out at 500-1000 J/kg mainly west of the Hudson River
heading into this evening, then still a few hundred J/kg MUCAPE
overnight across most of the area. Strong gusts still possible with
thunderstorms, but severe storms are unlikely as shear is lacking.

Minor/poor drainage flooding will be possible with thunderstorms as
they move fairly slowly with a weak flow aloft. Still can`t
completely rule out flash flooding due to the slow motion of storm
cells with plenty of moisture as PWATs average around 2 inches.

Warm and muggy conditions tonight otherwise, with potential for
overnight stratus/fog development in a moist and weak flow
environment.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM FRIDAY MORNING THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Broad upper troughing across southeastern Canada retreats northward
Friday into Saturday, with a low over the Great Lakes Friday
shearing into Ontario/Quebec on Saturday. A weak shortwave moves
east of the region Friday morning, with another weak shortwave
approaching Friday afternoon.

It appears that the surface trough that will be across the forecast
area will lift as a warm front during the day, aided by afternoon
seabreeze development. Subsidence and mid-level drying in the wake
of the departing shortwave should allow for a window for good
heating after morning stratus/fog dissipates, leading to very warm
and humid conditions (lower to mid 80s coast, to upper 80s to around
90 for NE NJ and LoHud). There`s potential for isolated to scattered
afternoon/eve convection in a marginally unstable and modestly
sheared environment with the approach of the next shortwave, and in
the vicinity of the warm front/seabreeze. This will be mainly for
areas N&W of NYC. Lack of focus and a stabilizing marine layer to
the east across the coast should limit shra/tsra activity thru early
Friday evening. Strong storms possible with severe storm chances
still limited by relatively weak 0-6km bulk shear, but perhaps a
little stronger than today`s shear. CAPEs will also probably be
higher on Friday, so trends will need to be monitored for the severe
threat.

An increasing threat for heavy downpours sliding west to east across
the entire area for Friday night through Saturday morning. There
will be strengthening mid/upper support ahead of shearing low to the
west. There will also be a strengthening a low-level jet ahead of an
advancing cold front and pre-frontal trough, advecting in an
increasingly sub-tropical environment with weak instability, deep
moisture with 2"+ PWATS, and a warm cloud layer.

The pre-frontal trough appears to stall over the area Saturday, with
potential for scattered afternoon convection ahead/along it in the
afternoon and evening. This appears to be the best chance of a few
strong to severe thunderstorms, roughly over the NW half of the
forecast area, based on moderate deep layer shear and SBCAPEs
potentially around 2000 J/kg. The exact location of the trough will
determine possible focus for training convection and a localized
flash flood threat as the flow parallels the stalled boundary. More
clarity on this part of the forecast in the next 24 to 36 hrs.
Activity should weaken in intensity as it translates to the coast
with waning instability and a deepening coastal stable layer
Saturday evening. The cold front will slowly move through the area
during the night with the end of the shower/thunderstorm threat.

Finally, a hot and humid airmass brings the likelihood of heat
advisory criteria being met for most of NE NJ for the Friday-
Saturday period. A heat advisory has therefore been issued here for
this period. Not enough confidence to include portions of the Lower
Hudson Valley or Western Passaic County at this point, but it may be
a close call. Surface dewpoints will have a tough time mixing out
during peak heating with surface troughs in the vicinity both days a
relatively moist boundary layer, and southerly-component surface
winds. 850mb temps progged at 18-19C both days, perhaps slightly
cooler Saturday vs Friday, and Saturday has more cloud potential.
Heat indices of 95-100 expected both days.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>At the onset of the period, a weak cold front will pass just
southeast of the area early Sunday morning with high pressure
building in from the west into Monday. With the exception of some
lingering showers for the south fork of Long Island and extreme
southeast New London, Sunday should be dry, but will need to watch
how far offshore the boundary gets. Shortwave energy embedded within
the longwave trough to the west will then send a frontal system east
across the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley states Monday night into
Tuesday. his will bring increasing chance of convection Tuesday into
Thursday.

A deep-layered SW flow during this time will maintain seasonably
warm conditions across the area along with increasing humidity
through Thursday. Daytime highs during this time will generally be
in the mid and upper 80s away from the immediate coast, along with
some lower 90s across metro NJ. Lows will mainly be in the upper 60s
to lower 70s, warmest across the NYC metro. Max heat indices at this
time look to fall just short of 95. Largely stayed close to national
blended guidance for this update.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.AVIATION /20Z THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak cold front moves towards the region, stalling near the area
tonight into Friday morning.

Outside of any scattered aft/eve showers and thunderstorms,
generally looking at a VFR forecast through about 05z. The best
chances for any convection will be across the Lower Hudson Valley.
Lesser confidence closer to NYC. There remains some uncertainty as
to how quickly any activity weaken as it approaches the NYC
terminals. East of NYC, confidence is rather low and will keep
conditions dry for now, however can not rule out a few isolated
showers.

MVFR/IFR conditions develop after 05z, primarily impacting the
coastal terminals. The low cigs will continue into Friday morning,
with slow improvement expected during the late morning into the
early afternoon.

South winds around or slightly above 10 kt this afternoon. We could
see some gusts up to 20 kt at the coast this afternoon. Winds
lighten tonight, becoming light and variable overnight.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Amendments will be likely for the timing of showers and
thunderstorms late this afternoon and evening.

KEWR may for a time become 140-150 due to a seabreeze in the
afternoon.

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...

Friday and Saturday: MVFR or lower conditions possible at times with
continued chance of showers/tstms.

Sunday and Monday: VFR.

Tuesday: Chance of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon,
mainly west of NYC.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Sub-advisory conditions expected through the first half of Friday
night. The exceptions are occasional gusts up to around 25kt late
day/early evening near the entrance to NY Harbor eastward to western
Great South Bay today and tomorrow. Winds and seas pick up on Friday
night with SCA conds on the ocean mainly late at night. Being a late
3rd period start, will hold off on issuing a SCA for the ocean
waters. SCA otherwise potentially needed on the ocean late Friday
night through Saturday night.

Sub-SCA conditions expected Sunday into Tuesday with high pressure
over the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Scattered thunderstorms with heavy downpours producing 1-2"/hr
rainfall rates are possible this afternoon/evening, mainly west of
the Hudson River. The primary threat is for minor/poor drainage
flooding.

Overall chances/coverage of showers and potential thunderstorm will
be higher late day Friday through Saturday evening. Total rainfall
amounts will vary greatly due to the convective nature, but an
average of a half inch to inch of rainfall is anticipated during
this period along with locally higher amounts. Once again, localized
1-2"/hr rainfall potential rates with scattered heavy downpours, but
this time across the entire area. The primary threat will be minor
urban/poor drainage flooding, but a localized flash flood threat
will exist in path of any training convection.

At this time, no widespread hydrologic concerns expected for Sunday
through Thursday. However, there is the threat for localized heavy
rain with any thunderstorms that may develop Tuesday into Thursday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
There is a moderate to high risk for rip current development
along NYC/LI ocean beaches today and Friday with a combo of
building southerly wind wave and 2 to 3 ft E/SE swell. The high
risk is for W LI and NYC beaches this aft/eve due to enhanced
seabreeze formation and large tidal range, which is possible
once again Fri aft/eve.

More widespread threat of high risk of rip currents for all
NYC/LI ocean beaches possible on Saturday.

&&

.OKX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>CT...None.
NY...High Risk for Rip Currents until 9 PM EDT this evening for NYZ075-
     178-179.
NJ...Heat Advisory from noon Friday to 8 PM EDT Saturday for NJZ004-
     006-103>108.
MARINE...None.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
