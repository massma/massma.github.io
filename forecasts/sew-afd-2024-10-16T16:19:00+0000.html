Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
919 AM PDT Wed Oct 16 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A series of fronts will cross western Washington today
and Thursday, bringing in cooler temperatures, widespread
precipitation, breezy winds at times, and chances for thunder.
Conditions will briefly dry out Thursday night ahead of an
incoming atmospheric river that could bring periods of moderate to
heavy rainfall to the region through the weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Currently not much shower activity as previously
expected, however post-frontal activity may still occur this
afternoon with the development of the convergence zone, bringing
the chance for heavier localized rainfall and even some
thunderstorms.

Previous Discussion...A deep upper level low stemming from the
Gulf of Alaska will continue to bring in more fall-like weather
through Thursday as it slowly shifts eastward. Post- frontal
shower activity has continued through the early morning hours, and
a cold front will swing across western Washington this morning,
spreading another round of rainfall inland. Breezy winds will mix
down as the front passes through, with gusts of 20 to 25 mph along
the cold front. Colder air will continue to filter inland behind
the front and allow conditions to destabilize by the afternoon,
allowing for convective banding that may locally enhance rainfall
rates. Forecast models continue to favor the development of Puget
Sound convergence zone showers this afternoon and evening, which
may produce locally heavy rain, breezy winds, and a few lightning
strikes. Temperatures will peak below normal today with highs
reaching the mid to upper 60s across the lowlands.

Another front will dive southward across western Washington this
evening, advecting more moisture into the region and stirring up
more shower activity. This system will provide enough forcing to
generate isolated thunderstorm activity (10% to 20% chance)
alongside convective banding that will cause locally heavy
rainfall. Ensembles carry the threat of nocturnal thunder before
shower activity tapers off throughout the day on Thursday. Highs
across the lowlands on Thursday will peak in the mid 50s with snow
levels dropping as low as 3500 ft. While rainfall totals through
Thursday remain somewhat uncertain due to convective banding,
preliminary totals show amounts between 0.25" to 0.50" for much of
the lowlands, with up to an inch or more over the Olympics and
Cascades. The mountain passes will see a transition from rain to
snow by early Thursday morning, and although above-freezing
temperatures will likely limit snow accumulation on the roads,
the passes may be slushy Thursday morning. Higher elevations of
the Olympics and Cascades are on track to see several inches of
snow accumulation through Thursday afternoon.

.LONG TERM...Ensembles continue to show
weak high pressure building inland late Thursday into Friday
morning, allowing conditions to briefly dry out ahead of a
stronger and wetter storm system. An atmospheric river pattern
will develop along the Washington and British Columbia coast by
Friday afternoon, with the potential to bring in significant
rainfall over the weekend. Moisture fetch from the central Pacific
will bring in a very moist air mass, with potential for up to 3 to
6 inches of rainfall over the northern Pacific coast, Olympics,
and North Cascades over the weekend. The lowlands will also see
abundant rainfall with possible totals reaching 1 to 2 inches.
However, precipitation totals are highly dependent on the track of
the atmospheric river, with latest deterministic models shifting
the bulk of the moisture slightly northward towards Vancouver
Island. The significant incoming rainfall will cause sharp rises
to area rivers, though flooding impacts are not anticipated at
this time. Warmer temperatures and gusty winds of 30 to 40 mph
will accompany the atmospheric river as it enters the region
Friday, with temperatures gradually lowering throughout the
weekend as the storm system shifts southward across western
Washington.

Precipitation will weaken by late Sunday as the storm
system pivots southward, with lighter shower activity lingering
into Monday. Ensembles show high pressure building into the
Pacific Northwest by the middle of next week, with mild
temperatures in the 60s.

.HYDROLOGY...As fall-like weather settles into the region, a
series of frontal systems will bring periods of rainfall to
western Washington throughout the week and into the weekend. There
is a signal of an atmospheric river pattern developing this
weekend that could bring in moderate to heavy rainfall at times,
though the exact timing and placement of this storm system still
remains uncertain. Precipitation amounts will continue to be
monitored closely over the next few days to determine if there is
a risk of elevated river flows. At this time, area rivers are not
currently forecast to rise into action stage or reach minor flood
stage.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft turning northwesterly
overnight into Thursday as an upper level trough moves through
the area. Low level onshore flow will continue to increase this
morning and will persist into Thursday.

Widespread MVFR to VFR ceilings across the region this morning, with
some isolated IFR ceilings in spots as a front continues to move
through western Washington. Shower activity will continue throughout
the day in the wake of the front, with isolated thunderstorms
possible during the afternoon and evening hours. A convergence
zone looks to develop across Snohomish County in the wake of the
system today, which could keep conditions at KPAE IFR to MVFR
through much of the afternoon. Otherwise, expect slight improvement
to ceilings this afternoon (outside of shower activity) towards
more widespread low-end VFR between 21z-23z. VFR ceilings look to
continue through tonight, before lowering back down to MVFR early
Thursday morning.

KSEA...VFR ceilings this morning with some scattered lower clouds
in the vicinity of the terminal. South to southwesterly winds 8
to 12 knots. Winds becoming south/southeasterly and easing to 4
to 8 knots between 01z-04z. Showers possible through the day in
the wake of the front. MVFR ceilings look to redevelop by 12z
Thursday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Multiple systems will move through the waters in the
next few days. Winds generally persisting between 10-20 kt this
morning as a system continues to make its way across the region.
Seas currently around 6-8 ft. Northwesterly winds will increase
to 20-30 kt and seas look to build to 10 to 11 ft across the
coastal waters with a system moving across the area waters on
Thursday. A warm front moving into the northern portion of the
waters Friday could produce gale force winds over the northern
portion of the coastal waters Friday into Friday night and over
the Northern Inland waters and the East Entrance of the Strait of
Juan de Fuca Friday night. The warm front will stall and weaken
Saturday. Trailing cold front will not arrive until Sunday night,
with possible small craft advisory winds over the coastal waters.

Seas will subside Thursday night into Friday before rebuilding
into the 10 to 12 foot range for most of the weekend.
