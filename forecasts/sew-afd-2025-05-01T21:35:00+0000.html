Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
235 PM PDT Thu May 1 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the region with warm and dry
conditions across western Washington. Chances of light rain showers
return Friday into Saturday as the next system moves into the
region. High pressure looks to then rebuild into the region on
Sunday and bring another round of dry and warm conditions into
early next week. The next system looks to approach the area
around midweek.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Recent 500mb maps depict an
upper level ridge over western Washington this afternoon, bringing
warm and dry conditions to the region this afternoon. Satellite
imagery shows clear skies across the area with plentiful sun to go
around. Latest temperatures across the interior spanning in the
upper 60s into the lower 70s, while some locations in the Cascade
foothills seeing temps in the upper 70s. HeatRisk this afternoon
continues to be widespread Minor (Yellow) threshold.

The aforementioned upper level ridge will shift eastward on Friday
as an upper level trough approaches the coast. A weak frontal
system will then make its way through the area Friday evening,
with rain starting along the coast in the afternoon and slowly
moving throughout the interior by the nighttime hours. Generally,
precipitation looks rather light with most areas seeing a tenth of
a inch or less of rainfall. Increasing cover will help moderate
temperatures some, but with southerly flow - could still see
daytime high temperatures Friday afternoon be in the mid to upper
60s, with some locations still reaching 70 (likely suspects in the
Cascade foothills).

The upper level trough will move inland on Saturday, keeping cloud
cover around with unsettled conditions. High temperatures look to
cool off into the mid to upper 50s, with showers likely in the
mountains. Upper level ridging looks to rebuild through Sunday for
clearer skies and drier conditions.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Upper level ridging will
continue through the first half of the week, giving way to a a
warming and drying trend across western Washington. Temperatures
will warm into the upper 60s on Monday, with temperatures on
Tuesday warming into the mid 70s. This would also reintroduce the
Minor (Yellow) HeatRisk to portions of the lowlands. Uncertainty
lies later in the long term period, with some ensembles continuing
the warm trend, and others introducing upper troughing developing
for the potential for precipitation and more systems to move
across the area. For now, have included chances of showers for
Wednesday and Thursday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the waters this evening. A weak
front remains on tap to move into the coastal waters on Friday and
inland Friday evening. Onshore will be on the increase as a SCA has
been issued for central/eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca starting
Friday afternoon, likely lasting through Saturday. Varying degrees
of onshore flow continue into the coming week as high pressure
remains centered offshore with lower pressure over the interior.

remaining that way throughout the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
