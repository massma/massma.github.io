Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
313 PM PDT Mon Jun 10 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak shortwave trough will enter on Tuesday with
light precipitation and slightly below average temperatures.
Mostly zonal flow to weak ridging into remainder of week with
benign conditions. But, cooler and wetter weather is slated to
return around the week`s end.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A transient weak upper-
level ridge is currently over the region. Model guidance has its
axis crossing the Cascades and into the Inland Northwest later
tonight. This progression will clear the way for a shortwave
trough ejecting out of an upper-low positioned over the Gulf of
Alaska into the area. Overnight lows are forecast to fall into the
upper 40s to mid 50s.

A weak front associated with the aforementioned shortwave will
enter into the early morning hours on Tuesday bringing light rain
and showers along the coast. Precipitation is expected to
continue inland as the morning progress with meager amounts. Up to
0.10-0.25" of rainfall is forecast along the coast and windward
Olympics. Similar is expected through the northern and central
Cascades but less than 0.10" is most probable throughout the
lowland interior. High temperatures will rise to the mid to upper
60s for most areas with mid 50s to lower 60s along the coast.
Widespread 40s are in the cards for lows.

The rest of the short term will feature pleasant conditions
across W WA. Guidance agrees on zonal flow aloft on Wednesday
before transitioning to weak upper-level ridging on Thursday.
Near-normal temperatures are in the offing with highs in the mid
60s to lower 70s on Wednesday then rising to the lower to mid 70s
for the interior. This won`t be long lasting however as the
pattern becomes active again towards the week`s end.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Juneary looks to return right
on time for the weekend. An upper-low out of the Gulf of Alaska
will bring increased rain and shower chances along with much
cooler weather. By Saturday, temperatures could range anywhere
from 5-10 degrees below normal for mid-June. Precipitation amounts
continue to look generally light through this period.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Increasing west-southwest flow aloft across the area
with a weakening front into Tuesday. VFR cigs this afternoon with a
few lingering mid clouds and increasing high clouds at times. Cigs
will lower along the coast tonight into Tuesday morning with
generally MVFR cigs in this area. Cigs will lower Tuesday morning
for the interior with increasing light rain potential as a front
moves across the area. Cigs will likely lower to MVFR for portions
of Puget Sound in the morning with the front, with slight potential
for IFR cigs for KPWT tonight. A convergence zone will form on
Tuesday afternoon across Snohomish County and drifting southwards
into Tuesday night for locally lower cigs. Light W/NW winds into
this evening with increasing southerly winds tonight with the front.

KSEA...VFR cigs with periods of high clouds into tonight. Cigs will
lower Tuesday morning as a weakening front moves through the area,
with a brief period of MVFR possible, mainly between 15-19z. Some
clearing expected in the afternoon with convergence zone drifting
southward late afternoon and evening. Light NW winds into this
evening with increasing S/SW winds Tuesday morning. Winds will then
shift northerly later Tuesday afternoon, generally ranging 8 to 14
kts during the period. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Lighter winds into this evening with increasing southerly
winds, especially for the Coastal Waters later tonight into Tuesday
morning with a weakening front moving across the area. A period of
westerly SCA wind gusts will be possible Tuesday for the outer
Coastal Waters. Westerly winds will then increase Tuesday afternoon
into Tuesday night for the Strait of Juan de Fuca with SCA winds
likely. Winds will become more northerly Wednesday into Thursday
with more of an onshore flow pattern Friday into the weekend.

Seas of 4 to 6 feet into this evening will build to 9 to 14 feet
Tuesday into Tuesday night. Seas will slowly subside below 10 feet
on Wednesday. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
