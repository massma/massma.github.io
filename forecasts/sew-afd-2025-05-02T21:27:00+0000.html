Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
227 PM PDT Fri May 2 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A trough will move over western Washington today
through Saturday, bringing in a round of showers. High pressure
will rebuild into the region on Sunday, bringing warmer and drier
conditions through early next week. Chances of showers increase
into the middle of next week with potential for another trough to
pass over the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Clouds will continue to
increase across western Washington this afternoon as the next
weather system moves into the region. Highs are on track to peak
in the upper 50s along the coast where cloudy skies and rain will
limit temperatures, with areas seeing highs in the upper 60s to
low 70s further inland. An upper level trough will continue to
spread a few bands of light rain eastward throughout the evening
and into the morning Sunday, with shadowing likely to occur for
lowlands east of the Olympic Mountains and Puget Sound.

The upper level trough axis will shift inland on Saturday,
maintaining cool and unsettled conditions across the area. Showers
are favored to linger over higher terrain, with little more than
cooler conditions and cloudy skies over the lowlands after a round
of Puget Sound convergence zone showers taper off by the late
morning. Temperatures over the weekend will peak in the mid 50s
to low 60s across the lowlands.

As the trough axis shifts eastward, drier air will fill in behind
on Sunday and an upper level ridge will build into the Pacific
Northwest. This will kick off a warming and drying trend into
early next week, with temperatures rebounding into the upper 60s
and low 70s by Monday under sunny skies.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Forecast models remain in
good agreement over high pressure building into western Washington
through at least Tuesday. This will maintain mostly clear and dry
conditions with a warming trend. Tuesday is on track to be the
warmest day of the period, with highs in the upper 60s along the
coast and in the upper 70s further inland. Some areas along the
Cascade Foothills and in mountain valleys may even reach the low
80s. This will bring a return to widespread Minor (Yellow)
HeatRisk across the lowlands early next week.

Wednesday brings the next chance of precipitation to western
Washington as a longwave trough centered over the Gulf of Alaska
advects a round of moisture into the region. Ensembles have kept
the best chances for precipitation over the northern and central
Cascades, with snow levels near 4500-5000 feet. Drier and mild
conditions are then favored to return on Thursday and Friday,
though ensembles show some variability in solutions.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft as upper level troughing
approaches from the west. VFR at all terminals this afternoon, the
exception being KHQM where there is a lowering of clouds from a
weak frontal system moving onshore. Increasing onshore flow as
well as lead to some breezy S/SW winds this afternoon, with gusts
up to 15 to 20 knots across the area. Ceilings will gradually
lower to MVFR across most of the interior areas late overnight
into Saturday morning as light shower activity spreads across the
region.

KSEA...VFR this afternoon with increasing cloud cover as a weak
system approaches the area. S/SW winds this afternoon with some gusts
possible up to 15 to 20 knots. Winds will decrease into the
overnight, generally hovering around 5 to 10 knots. Ceilings will
start to lower to MVFR around 06z-09z as some showers move across
the terminal, rebounding back to VFR by late Saturday morning.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weakening frontal system is moving onshore this
afternoon, with increasing onshore flow across the area waters. A
Small Craft Advisory remains in effect for the Central and Eastern
Strait for an onshore push this evening. A surface ridge over the
coastal waters and lower pressure east of the Cascade will keep
onshore flow through the weekend, for more potential headlines in
the Strait of Juan De Fuca.

Coastal seas hovering around 4 to 6 feet will increase slightly to
6 to 8 feet throughout the weekend.
