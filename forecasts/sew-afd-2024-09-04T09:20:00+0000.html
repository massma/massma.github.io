Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong upper level ridge combined with weak low
level offshore flow will lead to unseasonably warm temperatures
through Friday. The ridge will weaken and shift eastward by the
weekend for a return of onshore flow and cooler temperatures.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper ridge continues to
build over the region this morning as the low level flow
transitions to weak offshore. A shallow marine layer along the
coast extends inland through the strait and Chehalis Gap and
locally into portions of Puget Sound early this morning.
Increasing subsidence with the building ridge will lead to some
locally dense fog in those areas before it quickly burns off later
this morning. High temperatures will get a nice boost today with
near 80 likely for coastal areas and mid 70s to mid 80s across the
interior lowlands. An axis of thermally induced low pressure at
the surface remains oriented near the coast into Thursday morning.
High temperatures in the 80s will be common along the immediate
coast before the sea breeze cools things down late in the
afternoon. For the interior lowlands, it will be quite warm with
widespread highs ranging from the 80s north to lower 90s across
the Southwest Interior. A number of locations look to threaten
daily high temperature records on Thursday. Upper ridging will
weaken slightly on Friday with the thermal trough shifting inland
from the coast. Coastal areas look to cool 10 to 15 degrees on
Friday, but much of the interior lowlands will remain
warm...around 10 to 15 degrees above normal for the first week of
September.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Upper ridging continues to
weaken as it gradually shifts into the Northern Rockies over the
weekend. Dry conditions will continue into Sunday as temperatures
trend downward a few degrees each day. Ensembles continue their
previous trends of anomalous upper troughing developing offshore
early next week. A couple of dissipating fronts may manage to
produce a few showers over the Olympic Peninsula by later Monday
or Tuesday, otherwise we can expect more in the way of night and
morning cloud cover and temperatures returning to near seasonal
levels.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow aloft for much of today before
shifting southerly late tonight/early Thursday morning as upper
level ridging continues to intensify over the area. At the surface,
light and variable winds in most locations with northerly winds
along the east banks of the Sound. As surface thermal trough
develops today, northeasterly to easterly surface winds will be
possible.

VFR terminals present in the south Sound area as well as far
northern portions of the CWA, including BLI. Locations on the coast
as well as those along the Strait or adjacent to it are seeing MVFR
to IFR conditions thanks to marine stratus/fog. Locations with fog
are expected to burn off quickly by late morning due to the moisture
layer being pretty shallow. Afterward, VFR conditions are expected
to be widespread.

KSEA...VFR conditions with clear skies in place. Lingering forecast
issue is whether or not fog will make it to the terminal. With
latest reduction in vis at PAE and northerly winds, chances for such
do increase. While latest TAF update has a TEMPO group in to cover
this...probability of this occurring is likely closer to 25-30 pct.
Granted, this is higher than previous forecast...but not by much.
Anything that does form should be short-lived. Otherwise, VFR
conditions expected for remainder of TAF period. Northerly surface
winds generally 4 to 8 kts through 17Z, then increasing to 8-12 kts.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A thermally induced trough will extend northward along the
coast today, allowing for flow to transition to offshore and then
persist through Thursday. The trough will move inland on Friday,
allowing for high pressure over the northeastern Pacific to build
back into the coastal waters and for flow to transition back to
onshore. During this period, northerly winds will be dominant over
the majority of waters, with periods of east winds through the
Strait of Juan de Fuca. While some of these northerlies over coastal
waters may get close to SCA criteria, by and large speeds should
remain below any headline thresholds.

Seas will generally hover between 3 to 5 feet through Wednesday for
the Coastal Waters. Seas are expected to build again, this time
reaching 5 to 8 feet Thursday and Friday and largely shorter period
and dominated by wind-driven seas.

.FIRE WEATHER...Upper level ridging and an associated surface
thermal trough will be building and moving into western Washington
Wednesday into Thursday. This will allow for temperatures to begin
to rise and the air mass will begin to dry out and become unstable.
As fuels continue to dry, these conditions will combine to create
elevated to near-critical fire weather conditions over the mountains
on Thursday. A return to onshore flow over the Olympic Peninsula
will begin to bring cooler, moist air to the Olympics, but the
Cascades remain warm, dry and unstable. A Fire Weather Watch has
been issued for all the mountain zones for Thursday, going through
Friday as well for the Cascades. A return to onshore flow on Friday
looks to bring just enough moisture to relieve the Olympic mountains
of critical fire weather conditions, while conditions remain dry and
unstable through Friday over the Cascades.

Winds will also turn easterly over the Cascades beginning late on
Wednesday. While they will not be overly strong, a period of breezy
winds is expected late Wednesday night into early Thursday morning
as air funnels through the gaps over the Cascade crest. Another
period of offshore flow is expected Thursday night into Friday, but
it looks to be less strong.

Cooler and more moist air will return area-wide through the weekend
and into the beginning of next week. LH
