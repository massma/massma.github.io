Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
854 AM PST Tue Jan 14 2025

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Another chilly start to the morning across Western
Washington, with temperatures in the 30s. Observations currently
showing a mix of visibilities and ceilings across the region with
the fog and low stratus. Otherwise, the current forecast remains
on track and no significant updates are needed at this time.

Please refer to the previous discussion and updated aviation
section below.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...Upper level ridge over Western Washington through
Wednesday will weaken Wednesday night. Weak front moving through
Thursday followed by an upper level trough Thursday night. Upper
level ridge building offshore Friday will remain in place through
the first part of next week. High pressure at the surface today
and Wednesday and again Friday through Monday with light flow in
the lower levels allowing areas of low clouds and fog to form.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Satellite imagery shows low
clouds and fog along the I-5 corridor and the lower Chehalis
Valley extending west into Grays Harbor county. High clouds also
over the area. Temperatures at 3 am/11z were in the upper 20s to
upper 30s.

Upper level ridge over the area today with surface high pressure
in place. Light flow in the lower levels will keep the fog and low
clouds intact at least through the morning hours. Model soundings
show weak surface based inversions breaking early afternoon. This
combined with a little late afternoon mixing will help dissipate
the fog and low clouds briefly late in the day. With the fog and
low clouds hanging tough highs will only be in the lower to mid
40s.

Little change in the pattern tonight into Wednesday with high
pressure both at the surface and aloft. Light flow in the lower
levels with surface based inversions reforming overnight. Low
clouds and fog filling back in this evening into early Wednesday
morning for the interior lowlands as well as the Central Coast.
Cool air mass over the area with a couple hour delay in the
reformation of the cloud cover resulting in about 5 degrees more
of cooling overnight. Lows for the most part in the lower to mid
30s. Like today a little mixing in the afternoon will break up the
shallow inversions with some sunshine possible mid to late
afternoon. Highs Wednesday in the mid 40s.

Pattern breaking down Wednesday night with the upper level ridge
weakening. Light flow in the lower levels continuing allowing
another round of low clouds to form by early Thursday morning.
Weakening front approaching from the northwest will still be
offshore early Thursday morning but will be close enough for a
chance of rain along the north coast. Lows in the 30s.

Weak front moving through Western Washington Thursday with the
front into the Cascades Thursday afternoon. With the front
fighting its way through the flattened upper level ridge not
really much of it left as it moves through the area. Chance pops
Thursday with likely pops near the Canadian border. Any
precipitation will be light, less than a tenth of an inch. Highs
mostly in the mid 40s.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement with a high amplitude upper level ridge building
offshore and light offshore flow at the surface developing Friday
and continuing through Monday. The difference between the current
weather and the weather over the weekend is that the air mass
over the weekend will be cooler. Cool enough to limit the fog
formation in the late night and early morning hours ( frosting
out ). Lows below freezing will be widespread with the colder
locations in the lower to mid 20s. Even the warmer spots will only
be near freezing. Highs also below normal, near 40. Good chance
this pattern continues into the middle of next week. Felton

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge remains over the region with
northwesterly flow aloft. Light winds will allow for LIFR conditions
throughout the interior, with IFR to MVFR conditions along the
Olympic Peninsula. Expecting the Olympic Peninsula area to be able
to clear out a bit while the Puget Sound and Strait of Juan de Fuca
stays overcast today, with ceilings will slowly rise to IFR then
MVFR this afternoon. Light winds will continue tonight into
tomorrow, allowing for ceilings to once again drop to LIFR and fog
to redevelop. It currently looks like the Puget Sound may have a
better chance of clearing out tomorrow afternoon, but that will
continue to be monitored.

KSEA...LIFR conditions continue with low ceilings and fog. Light
surface flow will not allow for rapid changes, but expect fog to
linger around through around 18-20Z before ceilings begin to raise
to IFR then MVFR later this afternoon into this evening. Fully
clearing out appears unlikely today, so keeping MVFR through the
evening before dropping back to LIFR early tomorrow morning. Winds
will remain light north/northeasterly, around 4 kt or less through
the TAF period.

.MARINE...Surface ridging over the waters will shift inland
Wednesday night and a weak front will cross the waters Thursday
morning. Broad high pressure rebuilds offshore in its wake on
Thursday for increasing onshore flow and possible wind headlines for
the coastal waters and strait. Building high pressure over southern
British Columbia and east of the Cascades will lead to offshore flow
late in the week. Seas over the outer coastal waters will linger
near the 10 foot threshold into late week before subsiding this
weekend.  27

.HYDROLOGY...No river flooding the next seven days.
