Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
235 PM PST Sat Jan 11 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Calmer conditions over Western Washington as high
pressure begins to build over the region. A few showers will still
be possible at times this weekend, especially in the mountains and
near the coast. This strong ridge will continue building next week,
bringing mostly dry conditions and developing morning fog each day.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Still seeing echoes
associated with PCSZ over portions of Snohomish and northern King
counties, but radar trends continue to show it weakening, likely
petering out at some point this evening. Otherwise, no significant
radar activity at the time of this writing.  The only weather of
note are some lingering low clouds but even with those there are
enough breaks to allow some peeks of sun and blue skies this
afternoon.

Short term model output remaining pretty consistent with past runs,
yielding a nearly unchanged forecast. Upper level ridging over the
Pacific will continue to move slowly eastward, however lingering
moisture and a weak shortwave along the leading edge of the ridge
Sunday will keep PoPs in the forecast...even though they will be
quite trivial /10-30 pct at best/ and mostly focused either along
the coast or in the Cascades. The primary weather concern will be
developing patchy fog during the overnight and early morning hours
each day and attempting to time when it will lift...and the usual 10
AM to noon window serves as a good starting point, although latest
hi-res guidance and ensembles may prove helpful in shifting this
timing either forward or back.

Daytime highs will continue to cool Sunday and Monday, ranging in
the lower to mid 40s, before rebounding back into the mid to upper
40s for Tuesday. Overnight lows follow a similar trend as the ridge
aloft will help to clear skies out and foster radiative cooling,
with lows tonight in the mid to upper 30s, then falling to the lower
to mid 30s overnight Sunday and Monday.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...The upper ridge remains
the main player over the region Wednesday as the ridge axis pushes
onto the coastline and while models continue to show the ridge
flattening out due to an upper level low passing through British
Columbia, there still remains significant disagreements between both
deterministic models, the GFS keeping any precip well to the north
and the ECMWF allowing it to dip into much of the CWA. Ensembles
lean more toward the GFS at this time with the mean generally less
than 5 pct and a spread that tops out maybe at 13 pct. So while this
system may bring an increase in clouds to the area, little in the
way of impacts are expected. Upper level ridging will continue to
build over the Pacific for the latter half of next week with the
main forecast challenge being if systems sliding down the leading
edge of that ridge will be positioned in a way to bring precip back
to W WA. Ensembles do show an increasing probability...but phrasing
it that way implies a possibility that may not exist as those
probabilities top out around 20 pct. While the NBM is suggesting
slightly higher PoPs in higher terrain, the overall story is that
the extended looks to remain generally dry.

Temps will not vary much from what is expected in the near term,
however a cooling trend is expected starting Thursday and continuing
for the remainder of the forecast period. Highs will start off
ranging in the mid to upper 40s Thursday but lower into the upper
30s to lower 40s by the weekend.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper ridge offshore will continue into Sunday for
more northwesterly flow aloft. Winds aloft will transition more
north-northeasterly on Sunday as an upper low slides southward along
the NE periphery of the ridge. Generally VFR cigs this afternoon
with areas of MVFR and localized IFR continuing with stratus and
moisture at the surface. A few lingering showers also continue in
the vicinity of KBLI. Areas of stratus will continue into this
evening, with cigs lowering tonight into Sunday morning. In
addition, some clearing is expected this evening, which will allow
for fog development in spots around Puget Sound. Cigs will lower to
MVFR/IFR into Sunday morning, with areas of LIFR in low stratus as
well as vsbys reduction in fog. Slow improvement is expected into
early Sunday afternoon towards MVFR/VFR cigs. Light winds into
Sunday will have a more northerly component by Sunday afternoon.

KSEA...Low-end VFR cigs this afternoon with continued mid stratus
clouds. Brief periods of MVFR will be possible into this evening,
but primarily VFR expected. Cigs will lower tonight towards IFR/LIFR
with light winds and abundant moisture at the surface. At this time
there is approximately a 50% of IFR cigs late tonight into Sunday
AM. In addition, there is also an elevated potential for fog
development, especially between 12-18z, although there remains low
confidence in the location of fog around Puget Sound during this
period. Cigs will slowly improve to MVFR Sunday afternoon. Light
winds will continue into Sunday morning, with a light north
component Sunday afternoon. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will continue to build over the area through
Monday and remain over the waters through the majority of next week.
Elevated northwesterly winds continue for the Coastal Waters into
Sunday morning before tapering off later Sunday. A Small Craft
Advisory remains in place for the Coastal Waters during this period.
Winds will generally become lighter north to northeast Monday
through midweek. A front will then move southwards over Western
Washington later Thursday into Friday for increasing northerly
winds, especially for the Coastal Waters.

Seas of 10 to 13 feet will continue through tonight for the Coastal
Waters where a Small Craft Advisory remains in place. Seas will
briefly fall below 10 feet Sunday afternoon before building to 10 to
11 feet Sunday night into early Monday. Seas will fluctuate at times
between 7 to 11 feet next week. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
