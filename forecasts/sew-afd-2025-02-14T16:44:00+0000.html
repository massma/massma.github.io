.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Current radar imagery early
this morning shows scattered snow showers continuing to move
across Western Washington. Snow showers are expected to taper off
later this morning. Locations in the Southwest Interior and south
of Olympia have the highest chance (50-80%) of seeing an inch of
snow through Friday morning. The Seattle Metro and Kitsap
Peninsula have a 30-40% of seeing an inch of snow, while
locations north of Everett have probabilities near 0%. In
addition, there is a small chance (20-30%) of freezing rain in
Grays Harbor County and southwest Lewis County through Friday
morning; however no significant accumulations or impacts are
expected.

Generally drier conditions on Friday afternoon as weak ridging
builds offshore; however high-resolution guidance shows light
show showers may linger in the Cascades. The ridge will move
onshore Saturday morning, with a warmer frontal system trailing
right behind it. The frontal system is expected to move into
Western Washington on Saturday afternoon, bringing lowland rain
and mountain snow this weekend. Snow levels levels are expected
to increase to 3000-3500 ft. Significant mountain snow is
expected with this system. Guidance is showing that there is a
65-75% chance of seeing at least 8 inches of snow through Monday
morning at the passes.

Temperatures are expected to gradually warm up starting today.
High temperatures today will finally push above 40 across the
lowlands. By Sunday, high temperatures will be in the mid to upper
40s, while low temperatures will be in the mid to upper 30s.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Lowland rain and mountain
snow continue on Monday and will persist through late next week.
An upper level trough will push onshore on Monday, and weak
ridging will build behind the trough and push inland on Tuesday
afternoon. The next system arrives on Wednesday, with another
system following right behind on Thursday. Additional snow at the
mountain passes is expected, with snow levels around 3000-3500 ft
through late next week. High temperatures next week will be in
the upper 40s to lower 50s, with low temperatures in the upper 30s
to low 40s.
