Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
854 PM PDT Wed May 7 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A post-frontal airmass continues into tonight. An upper ridge
will nudge into Western Washington Thursday into Friday for
drier weather. Troughing offshore will bring increasing
precipitation chances over the weekend. Cooler, unsettled
weather early next week with an upper low over the Pacific
Northwest.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A mix of clouds and some sunshine this afternoon across Western
Washington. Onshore flow will increase into this evening,
allowing for light precipitation to develop over central Puget
Sound, mainly north of Seattle, as well as in the Cascades. Some
clearing elsewhere this evening into early tonight. Drier
conditions are then expected again on Thursday as an upper ridge
nudges into Western Washington. Localized fog may develop as
well south of Olympia early Thursday.

The upper ridge focused across the Western US will continue to
influence Western Washington, bringing dry, warming conditions on
Friday. Highs on Friday will warm into the 60s to low 70s. The
ridge will then slide east on Saturday as troughing develops
across the NE Pacific. Precipitation chances increase later
Saturday, albeit primarily light QPF amounts are expected,
particularly over the Olympic Peninsula. High temperatures cool a
few degrees on Saturday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Ensembles are in good agreement of an upper low moving across
the Pacific Northwest Sunday into Monday. Precipitation
potential generally peaks during this timeframe, with showers
around Western Washington. Cooler temperatures will also prevail
early next week, with highs only reaching the upper 50s to low
60s. A bit more uncertainty develops middle of next week, but in
general, a cooler pattern is likely to continue, with at least
a slight chance of precipitation at this time for both Tuesday
and Wednesday. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Ceilings are a mix of VFR and MVFR this afternoon as low
to mid-level clouds push across the region. VFR is generally favored
among the models to prevail for the majority of the TAF period, with
the exception of the Pacific Coast. Another round of rain will push
across the terminals this afternoon/evening. Guidance has the
precipitation concentrated along the interior terminals, primarily
along the Puget Sound and Bellingham terminals. MVFR ceilings are
possible in the heavier bands of rain, but overall rain is expected
to remain light. A weak convergence zone is favored to develop late
tonight generally between KBFI and KPAE.

South/southwesterly surface flow for the majority of Puget Sound
terminals today, with the exception of KPAE (northerly flow).
Surface flow along the coast and Strait will be more westerly. Winds
will be breezy this afternoon/evening, with sustained speeds of 10-
15 kt and gusting up to 20 kt. Stronger winds are expected along the
Strait, with speeds of 20-25 kt and gusts up to 30 kt possible.
Surface flow will shift northerly Thursday morning (4-8 kt).

KSEA...
VFR conditions are favored to prevail through the TAF period.
Another round of rain is expected this afternoon/evening. May
see MVFR ceilings in the heavier bands of rain (20-30% chance).
Models are in general agreement that a weak convergence zone
will develop late tonight; however it should stay north of the
terminal.

Breezy south/southwesterly winds this afternoon/evening, with
sustained speeds of 10-15 kt and gusts up to 20 kt. Winds will ease
overnight and northerly flow establishes Thursday morning, with
speeds of 5-8 kt.

.MARINE...
Strong westerly flow continues across the Strait of Juan
de Fuca for which a Small Craft Advisory is in effect. High pressure
rebuilds Thursday into Friday, bringing calmer marine conditions.
Unsettled conditions return during the weekend into early next week,
with winds looking to remain below small craft criteria at this
time.

Seas around 7 to 8 ft today will continue to ease into tonight. By
Thursday, seas will be around 5 to 6 ft and will hover around 4 to 5
ft into the weekend.
