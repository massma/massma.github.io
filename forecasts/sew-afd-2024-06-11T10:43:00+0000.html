.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level trough moving through Western Washington
today. Zonal flow aloft tonight into Wednesday with a weak ridge
of high pressure building Wednesday night into Thursday. Cool
upper level low moving southeast out of the Gulf of Alaska late
in the week. System spinning out of the low moving through Friday
with the low overhead for the weekend. The low will move
southeast Monday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
upper level trough with a weak cold front just offshore early this
morning. Mostly cloudy skies west of Puget Sound. Partly cloudy
skies east of Puget Sound. Temperatures at 3 am/10z were in the
50s.

Upper level trough and the weak front moving through Western
Washington this morning. Satellite imagery shows cloud top
temperatures not cold at all with the front. A good indicator
that there will be little in the way of precipitation with the
system. Best chances for showers this morning over the northern
portion of the area. It will get breezy near the Strait of Juan de
Fuca later this morning into the afternoon hours with increasing
low level onshore flow behind the front. Weak convergence zone
developing over Snohomish county will keep skies more cloudy there
than the rest of the area this afternoon with maybe a light
shower. Highs today a little below normal, in the 60s.

Zonal flow aloft behind the front tonight into Wednesday. Light
flow in the lower levels will keep the morning cloud cover from
being very widespread. Even with the sunny skies, the air mass
over the area is not very warm and what little flow there is in
the lower levels is onshore. Highs Wednesday again the in the
60s. Lows tonight will be a little cool over the Southwest
Interior, lower 40s, with mid to upper 40s for the remainder of
the area.

Weak upper level ridge building Wednesday night into Thursday in
response to a large cool upper level low beginning to move
southeast out of the Gulf of Alaska. Low level flow remaining
onshore. 500 mb heights peaking only in the mid 570 dms. Thursday
looks to be the warmest day in the next week with highs in the
mid 60s to mid 70s. Lows Wednesday night in the 40s.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Extended models continuing to
be consistent showing large cool upper level low approaching
Western Washington Friday with the low moving overhead for the
weekend. Weak front spinning out of the low moving through Friday.
Right now Saturday looks to be the coolest and wettest day with
the low right on top of the area. There is a 20 to 30 percent
chance highs Saturday don`t get out of the 50s, over 10 degrees
below normal. Low starts to drift southeast Sunday with the flow
aloft becoming northeasterly. This could help reduce the amount of
showers for Father`s Day especially in the afternoon.
Temperatures will remain cool with highs only in the upper 50s to
mid 60s. Upper level low moving off to the east Monday with a weak
broad upper level trough over Western Washington keeping a chance
of showers in the forecast and highs below normal, in the 60s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Increasing westerly flow aloft ahead of an incoming
shortwave trough. VFR conditions early this morning with increasing
clouds ahead of an incoming weakening frontal system. Ceilings will
lower this morning as the front moves in, additionally, a few
scattered showers will be possible. Widespread MVFR to occasional
IFR conditions are expected along the coast, high-end MVFR with
breaks to VFR are expected for the interior for the morning and the
early afternoon. Ceilings will lift this afternoon, with breaks in
the clouds possible by this evening. Weak post-frontal convergence
over southern Snohomish County and moving southward will keep
ceilings locally lower through this evening into the early overnight
hours. Scattered cloud cover looks to hang around tonight into early
tomorrow, but VFR conditions should continue to prevail.

S/SW winds will increase this morning to 10-15 kt across the region,
with gusts up to 25 kt possible. Winds will switch to northerly
through the interior tomorrow afternoon in association with the
westerly push through the Strait and remain northerly through the
remainder of the TAF period, through decreasing in speed this
evening.

KSEA...VFR this morning with increasing clouds ahead of an incoming
weak front. Ceilings lowering to low-end VFR to high-end MVFR this
morning with light showers/drizzle at times. Ceilings should raise
to persistently VFR this afternoon and cloud cover should break up.
Weak convergence north of the terminal may keep ceilings locally
lower at times this evening, keeping from completely clearing out.
Increasing S/SW winds up to around 10 to 15 kt, with gusts to 20 to
25 kt possible. Winds will shift to N this afternoon around 00Z,
then decreasing into this evening.

LH

.MARINE...Increasing southerly winds across the coastal waters early
this morning as a weak frontal system traverses the region today.
Winds will reach Small Craft Advisory criteria across the coastal
waters briefly this morning, as well as through the northern-most
portions of Puget Sound. Following the frontal passage this
afternoon and into tonight, west winds will push through the Strait
of Juan de Fuca and into the northern portions of Admiralty Inlet at
times, permitting additional Small Craft Advisories through late
tonight. Onshore flow will continue through the end of the week and
into the weekend as a frontal system will move through the region
Friday and Saturday. Several rounds of westerly pushes down the
Strait of Juan de Fuca are expected through this time period, some
of which may require additional headlines.

Seas 4 to 6 ft will build up to 12 to 15 ft by tonight, allowing the
SCA to continue through Wednesday morning for the coastal waters.
Seas remain at around 6 to 8 ft through the end of the week and into
the weekend.

the first 20 years. We have had a high below 60 in the last half
of June in Seattle the last two years, both on June 17th. Last
year the high on the 17th was 59 and in 2022 it was 57. In July
there have only been 15 days with highs less than 60 degrees. The
high of 58 on July 3rd in 2022 was the only time it has occurred
