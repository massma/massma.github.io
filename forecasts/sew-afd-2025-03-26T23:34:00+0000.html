Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
434 PM PDT Wed Mar 26 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cold front moving through the area tonight with
thunderstorms, possibly severe, out ahead of the front. Upper
level low remaining off the coast into Friday keeping showers in
the forecast. Low weakening to an upper level trough and moving
inland Friday night. Next system arriving late in the weekend.
Another upper level low off the coast for the first part of next
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
storms developing over Northern Oregon moving north at 4 pm/23z.
Middle level clouds out ahead of the storms spreading over the
southern portion of the area. Middle level cloud deck also
exiting the state to the north. Temperatures in the mid 60s to
lower 70s Seattle southward and in the 50s north of Seattle.

Severe thunderstorm watch 65 issued for King, Pierce, Thurston and
Lewis counties until 9 pm tonight. Near record warm air mass over
the southern portion of the area. Steep lapse rates in place along
with CAPE values of 1000 to as high as 2000 j/kg indicative of a
very unstable environment. Dew points in the mid 50s to mid 60s
so plenty of moisture to work with as cold front approaches the
area from the southwest. Wind profiles over the area supportive of
possible supercell development. Note the definition of a severe
thunderstorm is hail 1 inch or larger and/or winds gusting 58 mph
or higher. The amount of lightning strikes is not a factor in
determining if a thunderstorms is severe. The storms will reach
Lewis and Thurston county 5 to 6 pm and into Pierce and King
county around 7 pm. With the cooler surface temperatures and the
end of the daytime heating right now it looks like the storms will
weaken as they move north of Seattle. Front moving inland behind
the convection keeping showers going into the early morning hours.

Upper level low remaining off the coast Thursday with another
short wave spinning out of the low moving to the coast by late
afternoon. Showers increasing over the area in the afternoon.
There is a slight chance for thunderstorms but with the air mass
much cooler Thursday if a thunderstorm does form it will be much
weaker than the storms tonight. High temperatures cooling into the
mid and upper 50s.

Low drifting north and weakening Thursday night into Friday. Low
still close enough to send showers into Western Washington with
the heaviest showers in the afternoon Friday. Highs will continue
to cool into the lower to mid 50s.

Low weakening into a trough and moving inland Friday night. Weak
upper level ridge trying to build Saturday but with the air mass
still slightly unstable will have to keep showers in the
forecast.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Upper level ridge
strengthening Sunday as another negatively tilted trough
approaches from the southwest. Sunday looks to be the dry day in
the next week. Negatively tilted trough moving inland for another
round of rain Sunday night. Upper level low remaining off the
coast Monday keeping showers in the forecast. Low moving inland
and weakening Tuesday and Wednesday. Temperatures will remain near
normal through the period with highs in the 50s and lows in the
upper 30s to mid 40s. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southerly/southwesterly flow aloft this afternoon
into Thursday. A frontal system will push through this afternoon
bringing conditions down to MVFR. There is general agreement
between models that thunderstorm activity will impact the area
(moving south to north) between 23z-06z Wednesday
afternoon/evening, with some thunderstorms having the potential to
become severe. MVFR conditions expected during the thunderstorm
and shower activity, with brief IFR possible during the heavier
showers. The main threats with these thunderstorms will be:
frequent lightning, hail, gusty and erratic winds, and periods of
heavy rain. Conditions may change very rapidly (ceilings and
visibility) to IFR as these storms impact the terminals.

After the thunderstorm threat, scattered showers will continue into
the overnight hours. Conditions are expected to improve Thursday
morning to VFR. Another round of rain is expected on Thursday
morning. Surface winds generally from the south, with speeds of 6-10
kt, with the exception of KHQM (10-15 kt).

KSEA...Currently VFR at the terminal; however conditions will
decrease to MVFR this evening as a frontal system pushes through.
Thunderstorm activity is expected between 01z-06z. The main threats
will be gusty erratic winds, hail, heavy downpours, and frequent
lightning. As these thunderstorms move over the terminal, rapidly
changing conditions are likely, with ceilings and visibility
lowering to IFR within the heavier showers. Behind the
thunderstorms, scattered showers will remain possible into the
overnight hours and conditions are expected to improve to VFR
Thursday morning. Another weather system will impact the terminal
Thursday morning. Outside of thunderstorms, southerly surface winds
around 6-10 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>980 mb low well west of the area will approach the
coastal waters Thursday with gale force winds over the coastal
waters into Thursday night. Low far enough offshore for only small
craft advisory winds at the east entrance to the Strait Thursday.
Low weakening and moving off to the north Thursday night into
Friday with small craft advisory winds continuing over the coastal
waters and possible small craft advisory winds over the northern
portion of the inland waters.

Weak upper level ridge building over the waters Saturday with
winds easing. Next surface low associated with the negatively
tilted trough late in the weekend staying well offshore.

Seas building into the 12 to 15 foot range Thursday will subside
to near 10 feet Friday night and Saturday. Seas continuing to
subside Sunday into Monday. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showers and thunderstorms tonight with potential for
locally heavy rainfall at times in stronger activity. However,
due to the convective and spotty nature of this precipitation,
most area rivers are expected to stay below flood stage.
Precipitation will continue into the first part of next week with
Sunday looking like the only dry day at this time. The
precipitation is not expected to cause significant rises to area
rivers.

The exception is the Skokomish River, where heavy showers are
favored to bring the Skokomish into flood stage by late Thursday
evening. The river will crest near moderate flood stage Friday and
remain over flood stage into Saturday. Large uncertainty exists
over the amount of precipitation over the basin. Conditions will
continue to be closely monitored. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
