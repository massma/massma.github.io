Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
325 PM PST Mon Feb 24 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An atmospheric river pattern will continue with wet
conditions across western Washington. Periods of moderate to
heavy rain and strong winds can be expected through this evening
into Tuesday morning. Conditions are then favored to dry out mid-
week as high pressure develops, with a potential for more
widespread light precipitation into the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A deepening 978 mb low
offshore will continue to fill and move northward towards
Vancouver Island. As it does, a frontal system will continue to
impact western Washington through this evening and into Tuesday
morning, bringing conditions such as widespread lowland rain,
mountain snow, breezy winds, and high surf. Further interrogation
of individual hazards can be found below:

RAIN: Widespread rain has started this afternoon and will
continue into Tuesday morning. This frontal system has somewhat of
a convective nature to it, and has the potential for periods of
locally heavy showers to develop across the area throughout the
evening period along with the potential for a few isolated
lightning strikes. The most concentrated areas of rainfall will
be the higher elevations of the Olympics and Cascades where QPF
values range from 1 to 3 inches, which will cause continued
elevated river flows. See the Hydrology section for additional
details.

MOUNTAIN SNOW: Snow levels will lower to around 3500 to 4000 feet
later this evening, with the mountains seeing some significant
snowfall over the highest elevations. A Winter Storm Warning is in
effect for all Cascade zones until Tuesday at 4PM. Higher
mountain passes such as Stevens and White Passes could see up to a
foot or more of snowfall, along with Paradise perhaps seeing a
couple feet of snow. Uncertainty lies in exact snowfall amounts at
Snoqualmie Pass, where there is potential of some heavier
convective banding showers/convergence that could lower the snow
levels down to 3000 feet, enhancing the snowfall amounts to around
8 to 12 inches. Again, it does depend on where those heavier
showers develop and IF they develop.

WIND: South to southwest winds will increase later this afternoon
into this evening, with the strongest winds along the coast, with
gusts up to 60 mph as the aforementioned low pressure system moves
onshore. HREF continues to show high probabilities of gusts up to
50 to 55 mph throughout most lowland areas, peaking later this
evening (05z-09z). For the Tacoma, Seattle, Bremerton, Olympia,
metro areas into ensemble guidance continued to show relatively
higher probabilities of gusts up to 60 mph. Therefore, these areas
have been upgraded to a High Wind Warning - through 10AM Tuesday.
With winds generally peaking this evening into the overnight
hours with longer duration, power outages can be possible. Winds
will start to ease by early Tuesday afternoon.

HIGH SURF: Large waves of 15 to 25 feet on the coastline will
create high surf conditions. Large waves may wash over beaches,
jetties, and other structures unexpectedly. People can be swept
off rocks jetties due to the large waves - even sweep people into
the dangerous seas.

Rain will taper off across the lowlands by late Tuesday afternoon
as the low weakens and shifts eastward - with snowfall also
decreasing and winds tapering down.

An upper level ridge looks to develop by Wednesday, with
conditions drying out and becoming more calm. Temperatures will
warm into the upper 50s, even potentially hitting 60 in some
areas into Thursday. A splitting front could bring some light
showers across the area on Thursday, but looks rather weak.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Ridging will rebuild into
Friday for drier conditions, before it breaks down again allowing
troughing to retake the pattern for more lowland rain and mountain
snow.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Strong Pacific storm system impacting the region
tonight through Tuesday morning. The flow aloft is S/SW. Strong
surface winds associated with this system with gusts to 50-60 kt
along the coast, and 40-50kt in the interior. Winds peaking from
04-10Z tonight. Ceilings are within MVFR to low-end VFR with rain.
Showers are mostly focused in the Cascades Tuesday afternoon. 33

KSEA...Rain and strong winds tonight with gusts to 40-50kt
(peaking between 06-10Z). Winds easing but still remaining gusty
into Tuesday morning. MVFR conditions likely. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong Pacific storm system will bring elevated winds
and seas to the region tonight. Storm Warnings and Gale Warnings
remain in effect. Seas will build to 20-30 ft. Winds will ease
Tuesday morning although speeds will likely still remain within
Small Craft Advisory range for most waters. Wednesday brings
light winds due to high pressure with seas subsiding. A weak front
crosses the area on Thursday, with light wind following through
the end of the week. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The Skokomish River remains in Minor Flood Stage while
the Chehalis River continues to rise and forecast to get close to
flood stage. Other area rivers have crested and are falling, or are
on track to crest below flood stage this morning. The Flood Watch
remains into Tuesday for areas south and west of the Puget Sound,
mainly for the Chehalis River.

The next round of precipitation has moved into western Washington,
which should bring around 1 to 2 inches of liquid to the region with
isolated areas of 3+ inches possible. However, lulls in the
precipitation btwn pulses might be long enough to limit the crest
heights from what is being forecast, so that will need to be
watched.

Snow levels will eventually lower with this storm system to 3500-
4000 ft, posing less of a threat to area rivers with the exception
of the Chehalis. The additional precipitation is forecast to keep
the Skokomish River elevated above Flood Stage, rising again above
Moderate Flood Stage tonight, then dropping below flood stage
Thursday morning. The Chehalis River will be cresting between
Tuesday and Thursday, top to bottom,  but will likely have crests
just below Flood Stage. Other area rivers may enter Action Stage but
are not currently forecast to flood.

The heavy rainfall over the weekend, combined with the additional
rain today and Tuesday, increases the risk of landslides in the
mountains.
