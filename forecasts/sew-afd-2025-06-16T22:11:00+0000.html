.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The upper level
trough over the eastern Pacific will continue to influence the
region through the first half of the week allowing a series of
weak systems to brush the area. The first will approach the
region on Tuesday, boosting clouds and bringing a chance of
light precip/showers mainly to the coast during the day then
inland Tuesday night into Wednesday. There is a chance of up to
a quarter of an inch of rain is possible particularly over the
Olympic Peninsula and across the North Cascades. High
temperatures Wednesday will be run a few degrees cooler, with
most spots likely only climbing into the 60s, though a few may
make it into the low 70s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Thursday continues to
look like a transitional day - mostly dry with a few lingering post-
frontal showers. The upper level low expected to being to shift
onshore Friday into Saturday will bring more widespread rain and
cooler temperatures. Rainfall amounts across the lowlands at
this time continue to look around a tenth of an inch to a
quarter of an inch. Of note snow levels are expected to dip
down to 5000-6000 ft over the weekend, bringing the potential
for light snow accumulations to the tallest mountain peaks.
High temperatures over the weekend will generally trend below
normal as a result, with highs only expected to be in the 60s. Those
with plans for outdoor recreation in the mountains will want to
monitor the forecast for the latest information.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak shortwave trough is moving through western WA
this afternoon. A couple light showers north of KPAE are moving
across northern terminals (most of it is likely falling as virga/not
reaching the ground). High ceilings encompass most terminals this
afternoon (cirrostratus/stratus) with some low cumulus in some
spots. It`s VFR regionwide this afternoon and will remain so through
tonight, with the best chance of MVFR/IFR CIGs Tuesday morning being
along the coast. Winds this afternoon are generally southwesterly 5-
10 kt, though some diffluence from a push through the Strait of Juan
de Fuca will turn the winds northerly late this afternoon/evening
through to terminals along Puget Sound. They will return to
south/southwest tonight to around 5 kt, and pick up to 5-10 kt
Tuesday. Showers will arrive with a front along the coast Tuesday
afternoon, and spread inland in the evening.

KSEA...High clouds remaining over the terminal today, some of which
will clear in the evening/overnight. Chance of MVFR for Tuesday
morning at this time is only 10%. Winds are expected to turn
northwesterly after 23-00Z up to 05Z at 5 to 10 kt, before
turning back to the south tonight into Tuesday.
