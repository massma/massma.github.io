Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
950 AM PDT Sun Sep 8 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A cooling trend will set up over western Washington as
troughing returns to the region. Periods of light precipitation
will enter the region alongside below- normal temperatures under
an unsettled pattern through next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Conditions are murky out
there this morning as stratus has pushed inland into portions of
the interior - making for a mix of fog and low clouds at the
surface and cirrus and smoke aloft. Today marks the start of a
cooling trend across western Washington. Will need to continue to
monitor highs this afternoon however, as smoke aloft and light
flow in the low levels may impact stratus dissipation and keep
temperatures cooler. The remainder of the previous discussion
follows below, with updates made to the aviation section. 14

Southerly flow aloft will continue through the morning, maintaining
hazy skies across the region. A weak shortwave rippling through
the flow aloft is generating light showers, but most of the
activity is expected to stay to the east of the Cascade crest this
morning. Onshore flow will also bring in a marine push of low
stratus this morning, with ensembles suggesting the stratus will
make it as far inland as the south Puget Sound. Inland areas will
see the stratus burn off by the late morning with highs peaking
near the 80 degree mark, while coastal areas will see the low
stratus persist with highs in the 60s.

The trough axis will swing across western Washington later tonight,
ushering in westerly flow aloft that will scour out most of the
smoke aloft and bring in a cooler air mass. Stronger onshore flow
with zonal flow aloft will bring in increased cloud cover overnight
into Monday morning. Temperatures will return to near normal with
highs in the low to mid 70s across the lowlands and in the mid 60s
along the coast.

While forecast models continue to disagree over the depth of the
next incoming system, a trough is on track to approach the region
on Tuesday. This will allow for even cooler temperatures, with a
chance for incoming showers to spread across western Washington
later in the day.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Models remain in good
agreement over troughing mid-week, with a round of showers through
late Wednesday. Despite light rainfall amounts, the storm system
will cool conditions off well below normal with temperatures
peaking in the mid 60s on Wednesday. Below normal temperatures
will continue through the remainder of the period with an
unsettled pattern favored to continue through the rest of the
week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak upper level trough will move through the area today
and bring about more southwest, turning westerly, flow. This will
help filter the mid and upper level smoke to the east, with more
significant clearing by Monday. With smoke lingering today,
expect some reductions in slantwise visibility before it begins to
push east.

Low clouds, fog, and IFR to MVFR conditions for most interior
sites through 18-21z with improvements expected thereafter. 33

KSEA...Low clouds and reduced visibility likely lingering through
the 18-21z time period with improvements thereafter. S/SW winds
around 4-8kt. 33/Kristell<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...Onshore flow due to a weak frontal passage continues today
with small craft advisory winds in the central and eastern Strait of
Juan de Fuca tonight. Marine stratus clouds will impact most waters
through around 15Z this morning, scattering out thereafter through
18-20Z. Wave heights are expected to be between 3 to 6 feet
throughout the forecast period. A stronger frontal system bringing a
chance of rain to all area waters is expected to arrive by mid-week.
