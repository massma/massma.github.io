Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
310 PM PDT Sun Oct 27 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showery, cool conditions will continue into Monday as
an upper level trough moves onshore. Snow levels will fall to the
higher passes tonight into Monday. Briefly drier conditions will
develop Monday night and Tuesday before a vigorous frontal system
produces additional rain, mountain snow, and locally windy
conditions midweek. A trend toward somewhat drier conditions is
expected by the end of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Scattered showers and
isolated thunderstorms continue across Western Washington this
afternoon as a cool, unstable post-frontal air mass spreads
onshore. Snow levels will fall to the higher passes tonight with
the best chance of impactful accumulation across the North
Cascades where a Winter Weather Advisory remains in effect through
Monday morning. Surface gradients will gradually relax on Monday
morning allowing the breezy winds to subside. The upper trough
axis will push onshore early Monday for a continuing threat of
showers through the day and high temperatures a few degrees below
seasonal averages.

Shortwave upper ridging noses into the area late Monday night
into Tuesday allowing the region to briefly dry out. A vigorous
front will reach the area on Wednesday. In addition to another
shot of rain, models are advertising a fairly strong
east/southeasterly gradient just ahead of the front for likely
windy conditions for portions of the coast and areas adjacent to
the entrances to the strait. This system will be cooler than the
previous couple with good potential to see accumulating snowfall
at all of the passes by Wednesday night.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...A vertically stacked
trough is expected to follow the front on Thursday as it digs
southeastward toward west or northwest Oregon. This will keep
showers and cool temperatures in the forecast, though the focus
for much of the QPF may be on the southern half of CWA. Ensembles
continue to show upper ridging rebuilding just offshore by the end
of the week as an upper trough digs southward into California.
About half of the ensembles have some energy spilling over the top
of the ridge into Western Washington. This eliminates the
possibility of going with a completely dry forecast for next
weekend, but one can say that the week is shaping up to end on a
drier and quieter note that it began. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Widespread showers continue across the region this
afternoon. Still expect a few isolated thunderstorms into the
afternoon and evening with the best chances near the coast and south
of Puget Sound. Otherwise, predominantly VFR conditions are expected
across the region but may be occasionally interrupted by lower
ceilings and visibilities in heavier showers. Meanwhile, gusty
southerly surface winds will continue. Little change to the pattern
through the start of Monday, with additional showers (and some
potential for additional isolated thunderstorms) continues. However,
there are increased chances for ceilings to trend lower and settle
into the MVFR range for many terminals around 12z through the
morning.

KSEA...Rain showers continue with predominantly VFR ceilings
(perhaps even scattering at times in between showers), but brief
reductions in ceilings and visibility as stronger showers pass
across the terminal. Gusty southerly winds to around 25-30 kt will
continue.  Chances for seeing ceilings lower more solidly into the
MVFR range increase between 12-18z Monday. Otherwise, winds will
ease and showers eventually decrease through the day.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Widespread showers and isolated thunderstorms continue
across the waters today. This is enhancing the gusty winds across
the waters this afternoon and evening, and the current small craft
advisories for the interior zones remain in effect through 11 PM.
Winds also remain gusty over the coastal waters with gusts reaching
20-30 kt at times, but the bigger impact is the large seas. Boosted
the forecast about 1-3 ft above guidance through Monday in line with
current observations and decaying the very large seas associated
with a deep low moving near Vancouver Island today. This will bring
the potential for seas again building into the 18-20 ft range over
the coastal waters, with the largest seas beyond 20 NM from shore.
Rough and very steep conditions will continue on Grays Harbor bar
into Monday as well.

The pattern will generally remain active as a strong low pressure
system sinks southward from the Gulf of Alaska and into the region
on Monday before pushing inland to the south. High pressure then
returns Tuesday, but a strong frontal system arrives by Wednesday
bringing another round of stronger winds and significantly building
seas. The probability of gales has increased to near 50% with
southeasterlies ahead of this next front, so this will need to be
closely monitored. The next Gulf of Alaska low will then follow,
maintaining very active weather conditions as seas again are likely
to build to around 15 ft.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
