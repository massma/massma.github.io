Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
354 PM EDT Mon Jul 10 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure over New England tracks slowly northeast tonight.
Weak high pressure builds to the south and west late tonight
into Tuesday, and into the area Tuesday night. The weak high
moves across Wednesday, then passes offshore late this week.
Another frontal boundary may approach from the northwest late in
the week and over the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM TUESDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>At 19Z a weak low was centered across central New England with
a closing off upper low tracking across upstate eastern New
York. Surface based instability and CAPE to around 600 J/kg
remain across the lower Hudson Valley and southern Connecticut
through around 23Z to 00Z, as the upper low provide some lift as
energy rotates through the low. Scattered to isolate showers
and thunderstorms will remain possible into early this evening,
and then dissipate as daytime heating ends and with the low
tracking north of the region. Brief heavy rainfall will be
possible with the storms as precipitable water values remain
from 1 to 1.25 inches. However, the storms will be moving east
southeast 20-25kt, and widespread flooding is not expected.

Later this evening and into tonight the upper low and surface
low will be tracking to the north and northeast of the area as
heights begin to slowly rise, and a weak ridge builds to the
west. Once the showers and thunderstorms dissipate dry weather
will continue through tonight.

A seasonal warm and humid airmass will remain tonight.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper ridging builds into the area Tuesday and weakens Tuesday
night as a shortwave moves through the Great Lakes region and
then to the east, as a surface high builds to the south and
west and drifts south Tuesday night. A warm and humid airmass
will remain across the region with temperatures near seasonal
normals.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure builds into the region through the day on
Wednesday with generally quiet and dry conditions expected
through early Thursday. As high pressure moves offshore a warm
southerly flow will bring a return of higher humidity values
across the region resulting in some showers and thunderstorms to
develop each day through the beginning of next week as several
short wave troughs swing across the area.

Temperatures will remain at or slightly above through the long
term. The warmest two days in the long term will be Wednesday
and Thursday with forecast highs in the upper 80s to lower 90s.
Heat index values remain below heat advisory criteria.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

hour or two later. VFR conditions elsewhere with NW flow around
