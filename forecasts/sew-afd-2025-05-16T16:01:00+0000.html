Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
901 AM PDT Fri May 16 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Cloudy and showery conditions will continue across
the region through the weekend with temperatures remaining below
normal. The chance of thunderstorms will increase to around 20
percent across much of the region Saturday afternoon. Showers
continue through the start of next week as the pattern remains
somewhat active. A shift to somewhat warmer conditions is
possible late next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Previous discussion...Onshore
flow continuing across the region with continued rain in the wake
of the passing frontal system. Moist, westerly flow aloft will
continue through the day today with cloudy and cool conditions
continuing. Another disturbance slides across the region Saturday,
with another round of showers across the area. Instability
increases a bit during the afternoon and evening showers, with
around a 20% chance of thunderstorms across portions of the area
(generally south and east of Puget sound, extending through the
Cascades). Snow levels remain somewhat low into Sunday, around
4000 ft or so, and some light snow may fall in the mountains as a
result. However, any accumulations should be light (less than an
inch) and short-lived.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Heights rise a bit
by early Monday with an upper ridge moving through the region,
bringing a decrease in shower activity. This should also allow
for temperatures to trend back up a couple of degrees, mostly
in the lower 60s. Another front arrives late Monday or Tuesday
for another round of cloudy and showery conditions, along with
breezier winds. Ensemble guidance begins to split later in the
week, with the forecast continuing to reflect modest onshore
flow maintaining clouds and near normal conditions, but the
potential for a slightly warmer and perhaps drier pattern to
emerge by the late stages of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft will become southwesterly tonight as
the next in a series of upper troughs and associated weak fronts
approaches Western Washington. The air mass remains quite moist with
widespread low MVFR or IFR ceilings. Only marginal improvement is
expected late this afternoon with ceilings remaining MVFR areawide
with scattered showers. Shower coverage will increase overnight into
early Saturday with ceilings dropping back to low MVFR or IFR.

KSEA...Low MVFR or occasional IFR with scattered showers and/or
drizzle in the vicinity expected to persist into midday. Current
thinking leans toward pessimistic approach to any improvement with
ceilings only lifting to 020-025 late in the day. Showers will
increase late tonight into Saturday with low MVFR or occasional IFR
ceilings persisting. Surface winds S/SW generally 5 to 8 knots. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system will move over the waters today and
weaken as it moves inland. Surface high pressure will build over the
coastal waters Saturday into Sunday. This will bring increased
onshore flow over the coastal waters and Strait of Juan de Fuca. The
next frontal system arrives Monday. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SEW WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
WA...None.
PZ...Gale Watch from Saturday morning through Saturday evening for
     Central U.S. Waters Strait Of Juan De Fuca-East Entrance
     U.S. Waters Strait Of Juan De Fuca.
