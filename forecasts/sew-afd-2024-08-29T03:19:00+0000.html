Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
819 PM PDT Wed Aug 28 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Dry and warming conditions are expected over the next
several days. High temperatures will likely reach the 80s across
the lowlands by the weekend. A weak weather system will bring
cooler conditions and the chance for rain back to the region by
Monday or Tuesday next week.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Latest satellite imagery, as
well as a look out the window, shows clear skies over W WA this
evening...which is not surprising given the upper level ridge
building into the area. Daytime highs today were still on the mild
side with most locations seeing temps a few degrees shy of normal.
That will not be the case tomorrow as temps will climb to either
right around or just above normal. On the flip side, overnight lows
tonight should be a little warmer than last night. That, coupled
with the diminishing amount of moisture over the area, should help
to keep any fog threat fairly isolated and not as dense as what
emerged early this morning.

Inherited forecast covers the above adequately and as such no need
for any evening updates. For additional forecast details, please
refer to the Previous Discussion section below.

From Previous Discussion...Mostly clear skies are in place across
western Washington this afternoon. The upper level trough that
brought active weather to the region yesterday has moved off to the
east while ridging begins to build along the Pacific coast. This
ridging will result in dry conditions and a gradual warming trend
that will last in the weekend. This warming should also reduce the
coverage/intensity of morning fog each morning.

By Saturday, expect highs generally in the upper 70s and 80s
across western Washington. This will result in HeatRisk levels
reaching moderate/orange across many areas. The highest HeatRisk
levels are expected in the Cascade valleys where very isolated
major HeatRisk is possible. At this time, conditions appear
unlikely to warrant any heat products, but we will continue to
monitor the forecast. Warm conditions will continue into Sunday as
the ridge axis slides east of the area.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...From Previous
Discussion...By Monday, a compact but relatively weak upper level
low meandering around the eastern Pacific will get ejected northeast
somewhere between northern CA and southern WA Monday into Tuesday.
This will allow cooler temperatures and a slight chance of
precipitation to return to the area. At this time, there is not a
robust signal for significant precipitation/convection, however
again - it`s something we`ll be monitoring.

Confidence in the details of the pattern decrease significantly
by the middle of next week. However, extended outlooks from our
colleagues at the Climate Prediction Center strongly favor above
normal temperatures and a weak signal for below normal
precipitation.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow aloft through Thursday with an upper
ridge building offshore. Clear skies this evening across the area
terminals. Most areas will remain SKC through Thursday. However,
patchy fog may develop early Thursday morning, mainly along the
coast, as well as local river valleys, and in Whatcom County for
brief LIFR vsbys, mainly between 12-17z. Lighter N/NE winds tonight
will increase northerly Thursday.

KSEA...Clear skies through the TAF period. NE surface winds will
generally range 5 to 9 knots tonight, increasing from the north by
midday Thursday. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will continue building offshore, with a
thermally induced low expanding along the Oregon and Washington.
Northerly winds are expected over the area waters over the next
several days, generally remaining under any advisory levels.
However, brief SCA wind gusts are possible this evening, and again
Thursday evening, in the central and southern inner Coastal Waters.

Coastal seas generally around 4 to 6 feet into the weekend.

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>From Previous Discussion...High pressure will begin
to develop east of the Cascades on Thursday with a thermal trough
along the coast. This will allow winds to turn light offshore over
the Cascades starting Thursday. This will allow relative humidity
values to drop into the 30s, even as low as 20-25% possible in the
southern parts of the Cascades and valleys. Relative humidity
recovery will be poor overnight, only reaching around 40-60%. Area
fuels are currently moist from recent rains, but these conditions
will allow them to dry out quickly. It will be important to monitor
how fast fuels respond, especially as temperatures warm through late
week and instability looks to increase into the holiday weekend.
