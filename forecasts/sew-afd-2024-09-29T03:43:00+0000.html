Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
843 PM PDT Sat Sep 28 2024

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Narrow band of showers moved through the Puget Sound
area between 5 pm and 7 pm has now moved into the Cascades. Middle
level cloud deck over the Northwest Interior with less cloud cover
to the south. Surface gradients have turned onshore this evening
which will produce areas of low clouds Sunday morning. The marine
layer will be shallow so by midday just more middle and high level
clouds. Current forecast has the trends covered. No update this
evening. Previous discussion below with updated aviation section.

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Drier conditions as southwesterly flow aloft
continues. A subtle trough will enter western Washington tonight
into Sunday increasing precipitation chances. An upper level ridge
will set up to start the new week, however a series of troughs
will influence the pattern. A frontal system looks to arrive on
Friday.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/... Southwesterly flow aloft
across the area as a trough axis resides offshore. Downstream, an
upper-ridge is dominating the Rockies and Four Corners region.
Here locally, conditions are currently dry but KLGX is picking up
on echoes just offshore. Meager precipitation is expected if any
should fall out of this band of reflectivity. The mountains have
the best chance (15%) of seeing shower activity earlier in the
evening. For tonight, mostly dry weather is expected. Overnight
lows are to fall in the 40s.

Showers are again in the forecast on Sunday as the upper-trough
progress throughout the region. Any lingering precipitation should
end Sunday night as ridging builds in and hangs out into Monday.
Then, a low center is modeled to deepen in the Gulf of Alaska
Monday night into Tuesday. This feature will help flatten the
ridge and even reintroduce precipitation chances into Tuesday.

Highs are forecast to top out generally in the 60s but a few 70s
could return on Tuesday. Overnight lows will bottom into the 40s
but can`t rule out some upper 30s sneaking into the forecast
particularly on Sunday night in rural areas away from water
sources and the typical cold pockets.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...PoPs are to remain in
the forecast through midweek but are at this point still
unimpressive. The best chances reside within the northern half of
the CWA. Guidance remains in line with the arrival of a frontal
system entering the region on Friday. There remains some
differences on its exact track at this time but there is a
consensus on ridging redeveloping by Saturday.

.AVIATION...Westerly to southwesterly flow aloft western
Washington this evening. Mostly VFR this evening with the
exception of KPWT where a MVFR deck is consolidating. Onshore flow
will continue overnight for another round of stratus by Sunday
morning, where reduction in cigs and vsbys throughout the Sound to
MVFR is favored.

KSEA...Westerly to southwesterly flow at the terminal this
evening. Cigs likely to stay VFR through late tonight with upper
level clouds remaining. The onshore component of the winds will
favor another round of stratus at the terminal on Sunday morning,
but guidance is suggestive of only a 25 percent chance of cigs
below 3000 ft through Sunday morning. That probability rapidly
decreases into the early afternoon as more sunshine is favored.

.MARINE...Onshore flow will increase later today into tonight
ahead of a weak system moving into southern B.C. Light echoes are
showing up on the northern coast as of 21Z, but are not likely
producing meaningful precipitation. Small craft advisory
westerlies in the central/east strait this evening and overnight
are still expected and present headlines have not been adjusted.
Northwesterlies will also pick up over the coastal waters tonight,
coupled with elevated seas. The small craft advisory for the
outer waters was extended by a few hours to account for a slightly
longer duration of stronger winds and elevated seas.

Surface ridging offshore will expand into the inland waters late
Sunday into Monday allowing onshore flow to relax and perhaps turn
weakly offshore. A weak front will approach the area late Tuesday
into Wednesday for possible wind and sea related headlines over the
coastal waters.
