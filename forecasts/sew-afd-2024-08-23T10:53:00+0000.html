.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Main message for the next two
days is unseasonably cool and wet weather.

Satellite imagery shows upper level low off the Central Oregon
coast early this morning with cloudy skies over Western Washington.
Doppler radar has scattered showers across the area with
lightning obs indicating a few strikes still going on in the
Central and Northern Cascades. Temperatures at 3 am/10z were a
couple of degrees either side of 60.

Upper level low not moving much today. A little break in the
action once this current shortwave moves out of the area early
this morning. The break will be short lived with another vort max
spinning around the low moving into the area midday increasing the
shower activity across the area from south to north. Even with the
short break this morning the air mass is moist in the lower levels
keeping skies cloudy. Chance of thunderstorms over the Cascades
this afternoon with the next vort max. For the lowlands cloud
cover keeping temperatures below convective temperatures, lifted
indexes only near 0, CAPE less than 200j/kg and lapse rates mostly
in the plus 5 or 6 degree range. Models indicating a 10 to 15
percent chance of thunderstorms in the lowlands. Given the
variables will confine the chance of thunderstorms to the Cascades
this afternoon. Highs only a couple of degrees warmer than the
current temperatures, in the lower 60s.

Upper level low moving eastward tonight and weakening. Two things
going on tonight. First the vort max will exit the area. Flow
aloft becoming more easterly. Evening thunderstorms over the
Cascades could get into the foothills before weakening. With the
low moving inland a deformation zone looks to set up, especially
over the central and northern portion of the area late tonight
into Saturday morning keeping showers going overnight. Will have
to keep an eye on the Central and Northern Cascade burn scars.
It`s not out of the realm of possibility that these locations will
receive over an inch of rain overnight ( good news for the fires
). Depending on where the zone sets up Skagit and Whatcom county
could also see up to an inch or more of rain overnight ( Bellingham
could get their normal August rainfall of 1.13 inches in a 12
hour period overnight ). Lows tonight in the mid 50s.

Upper level low weakens into a trough by Saturday morning with
the upper level trough moving east of the Cascades in the
afternoon. When this happens the deformation zone will dissipate
leaving just scattered showers in the area in the wake of the
trough. Increasing onshore flow behind the trough will make for a
breezy August day. Even with the trough moving east low level
onshore flow keeping skies cloudy. Highs again well below normal,
in the lower to mid 60s.

Drying trend starting Saturday night with an upper level ridge
building into the area behind the trough. 500 mb heights
rebounding to the mid to upper 570 dms by 12z Sunday. Low level
onshore flow will keep skies at least mostly cloudy. Lows in the
50s.

Upper level ridge continuing to build over the area Sunday with
500 mb heights in the lower to mid 580 dms by the end of the day.
Low level flow remaining onshore and with plenty of low level
moisture to work with will take a while for the combination of
late August sun and subsidence from the upper level ridge to get
rid of the low level moisture. Sun coming out in the afternoon
with highs warmer, but still below normal, in the mid 60s to
lower 70s.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement with the upper level ridge moving east Monday and
another upper level trough moving into Western Washington Monday
night and Tuesday. This feature will bring a chance of showers
back to the area. Trough kicking out to the east Tuesday night
with a stronger upper level ridge building beginning Wednesday.
The ridge looks to last into the following weekend. Highs Monday
in the mid 60s to mid 70s cooling into mostly in the 60s for
Tuesday. Temperatures warming again Wednesday with highs in the
mid 60s to mid 70s. Warming trend continuing Thursday with highs
mostly in the 70s. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low off the coast of OR will gradually
push inland today. The system will continue to bring rain and
chances for isolated thunderstorms to the region throughout the
day. Current conditions early this morning are a mixed bag of
MVFR to VFR across the area terminals, with radar showing showers
streaming northward across the region. Isolated chances for
thunder will continue throughout the day, however confidence
remains too low for inclusion for any single TAF site at this
time. Expect more widespread MVFR conditions to develop during the
early morning hours and for these conditions to persist through
the day. IFR conditions will be possible in any heavier showers.
Surface winds S/SW at 3-6 kt will increase to 10-15 kt by this
evening. Gusts to 25 kt will be possible at times for Puget Sound
terminals into Saturday morning.

KSEA...MVFR conditions with rain at the terminal. Expect
conditions to remain MVFR throughout the day with rain continuing,
though could see ceilings and visibilities dip to IFR in heavier
rain at times. Winds S/SW at 3-5 kt, increasing to 10-15 kt this
evening. Gusts to 25 kt will be possible at times tonight through
Saturday morning. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A low pressure system will remain situated along the
Oregon coast today and gradually push inland on Saturday. A weak
frontal system then looks to move into the area waters on Saturday,
which will be followed by yet another system pushing into the
area waters on Monday. High pressure will then gradually build
back into the northeastern Pacific Tuesday and persist through
midweek.

Rain and isolated thunderstorms will continue to move up
into the region from the south today and may bring gusty winds,
lightning, and low visibilities to portions of the area waters at
times. Onshore flow will increase through the day, with westerly
winds picking up towards small craft criteria late this morning
across the central and eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca. Winds along
the Strait look to peak tonight into early Saturday. Latest guidance
continues to show southerly winds increasing across the interior
waters tonight as well, so have issued Small Craft Advisories for
the Puget Sound, Admiralty Inlet, and Northern Inland Waters for
frequent gusts to 25-30 kt, which are expected to persist through
Saturday morning.

Seas across the coastal waters will generally persist at 3-6 ft
through the weekend and into early next week. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

inches. Some record low maximums for today, Bellingham 61 degrees
set in 1973, Seattle 59 degrees in 1960 and Olympia 60 degrees in
