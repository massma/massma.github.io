.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low spinning across the Pacific
Northwest will continue to bring chances of snow showers to
western Washington over the next few days before pushing inland
on Friday. Cold, below normal temperatures will persist across
western Washington throughout the week. Gusty Fraser Outflow
winds will continue to produce wind chills in the single digits to
teens for northern areas like Whatcom County into midweek.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low will
continue to circulate offshore before pushing inland late Thursday
into Friday. This will continue to bring chances of snow showers
to western Washington throughout much of the week.

Current temperatures continue to fall early this morning and
generally range in the 20s to mid 30s across much of the area as
of 3AM/11Z. Expect to see temperatures continue to drop, with
most lowland areas expected to fall into the 20s this morning.
Gusty Fraser Outflow winds continue across Whatcom County, with
winds generally persisting at 25 to 35 mph. Wind chills across
Whatcom County have fallen into the single digits as a result.
Wind chills are generally expected to range in the teens to low
20s for the San Juan Islands and portions of the northern Olympic
Peninsula- thus, cold weather advisories remain in effect for
these areas through this morning.

The majority of precipitation has switched back over to snow,
with radar showing snow showers moving northward along the coast
and into Skagit and Whatcom counties this morning. Latest hi-res
guidance has showers tapering across the interior over the next
few hours, however indicates showers could persist along the
coast throughout the day. Given the showery nature of the
precipitation, snow amounts will vary greatly, with many interior
areas east of the Sound likely to just see a trace to a half an
inch of snow through this morning. Areas along the Pacific coast
could see additional snow amounts of 1-1.5 inches in any heavier
shower activity through the morning hours. As a result, winter
weather advisories remain in effect for these areas. High temperatures
today will be in the 30s for most areas.

Another round of accumulating snow will be possible for the area
from Wednesday afternoon into Thursday morning as a shortwave
trough and vort max associated with the upper low offshore swing
across the region. Latest NBM probabilities indicate roughly a
40-50 percent chance of at least 1 inch of snow falling within a
24 hour period for the Seattle and Tacoma metros by Thursday
morning. The bulk of the moisture looks to remain focused across
the southern half of the CWA at this time- so expect higher
chances of accumulating snow for areas generally from King County
southward. However, confidence remains low - and given the
showery nature of the precipitation, can expect amounts to again
be highly variable across western Washington. Localized higher
snow amounts will be possible in any banding that develops. High
temperatures will be in the 30s to near 40 both Wednesday and
Thursday, so expect the best chances of any accumulating snow to
be late Wednesday into early Thursday morning.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...The upper level low will move
inland on Friday, allowing for flow aloft to transition to
northwesterly and for conditions to dry somewhat across western
Washington on Friday. However, an embedded shortwave in the flow
aloft could bring another round of light showers to western
Washington Friday night into the weekend. Conditions then look to
remain showery into next week as another low looks to drop into
the region from British Columbia on Monday. While spread in the
temperature forecast remains, temperatures look to remain cool,
below normal through the long term. Highs generally look to trend
in the upper 30s to near 40 and overnight lows look to trend in
the 20s. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft as low level flow turns
northerly as an upper level low continues to churn offshore. A
mixed bag of conditions out there early this morning from
MVFR/IFR/LIFR as scattered snow showers persist in the area.
Decreased ceilings and visibilities will likely continue
throughout the morning with localized IFR in and near snow
showers, with visibilities in heavier showers around 1-3SM.
Conditions look to improve into the later half of the day
(21z-23z) to low end VFR/MVFR with shower coverage gradually
decreasing across the region.

KSEA...MVFR conditions early this morning as occasional snow
showers move over the terminal. These scattered snow showers will
start to decrease in coverage later this morning (13z-16z) with
conditions gradually improving to VFR by this afternoon. Easterly
surface winds becoming more northeasterly by 12z around 5 to 10
knots. Winds look to become more northerly after 21z while
maintaining the same speeds.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface trough will continue to remain over the
coastal waters with surface ridging in place over British
Columbia. Fraser River outflow winds will continue through
Wednesday morning, where a Small Craft Advisory remains for the
Northern Inland waters, the Central/West Strait of Juan De Fuca,
and the adjacent inner coastal waters. Offshore flow will persist
through the end of the week, with low pressure offshore and
higher pressure inland.

Combined seas generally around 3 to 6 feet will continue
throughout the rest of the week.
