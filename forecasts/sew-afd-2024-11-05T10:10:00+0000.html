Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
210 AM PST Tue Nov 5 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mountain snow showers will taper off early this morning.
High pressure building today into Wednesday will allow for a period
of dry and cooler conditions. A return to an active pattern is then
expected beginning Friday through early next week with several
systems moving through the area with additional rain, mountain snow,
and wind.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery early
this morning shows cirrus moving in from the northwest over a
building upper level ridge and behind a departing shortwave trough.
Satellite and radar imagery also shows continuing light rain/snow
showers over the central Cascades due to strong moist onshore flow.
Snow has largely ended through the North Cascades, thus will cancel
the Winter Storm Warning this morning. Elsewhere, snow showers will
being to taper off later this morning, as will the Winter Storm
Warning north-central Cascades and the Winter Weather Advisory for
the south-central Cascades. The upper level ridge and associated
surface high pressure will build today and into Wednesday, allowing
for a period of drier and cooler weather, with high temperatures in
the low 50s and low temperatures in the low to mid 30s. A weak warm
front offshore that skirts by to the northwest keeps low chances for
light rain over the northwest coast, otherwise most of western
Washington will see decreasing clouds and even some sunshine
Wednesday and early Thursday. Increasing clouds on Thursday will
signal the return of more unsettled weather going into late week.
Thursday will be a bit warmer, with highs in the mid to upper 50s
and lows in the 40s as the low-level winds turn more offshore.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...The upper level ridge over
the region breaks down, allowing for a series of upper-level troughs
to move through the area. The exact evolution of the pattern is a
bit uncertain as the deterministic model solutions vary greatly in
terms of the strength, evolution, and timing of each system. In
general, chances for rain persist through the long-term period. A
weakening front looks to move through late Friday into Saturday,
with a stronger system Sunday into Monday that will likely have
better upper-level support. Snow levels will be high (above 6000 ft)
with the first system, lowering Saturday into Sunday, and the second
system will bring another round of substantial mountain snow. Winds
will also be breezy throughout this period. Temperatures look to be
fairly static, with highs in the low 50s with lows in the 40s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge centered well offshore will
gradually build into the region with northwesterly flow aloft
continuing. Post-frontal onshore flow will continue to ease through
the day then become light northerly or weakly offshore tonight into
Wednesday. Primarily VFR conditions are expected across Western
Washington today as plentiful high and mid level clouds stream
across the area ahead of a dirty ridge axis offshore. Light surface
winds and some clearing tonight into early Wednesday will allow the
formation of some IFR or low MVFR stratus...especially across south
Puget Sound, the Southwest Interior, and portions of the coast.

KSEA...Expecting VFR ceilings today under varying amounts of mid and
high level cloud cover. Surface winds light S/SE this morning will
veer to light N/NE by late afternoon into this evening.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Small craft advisories remain in place across the
coastal waters and the strait today as seas remain hazardous
and post-frontal westerlies gradually ease. Surface ridging
over the coastal and offshore waters will shift inland tonight with
light offshore flow developing. A warm front will brush the coastal
waters later today into tonight. High pressure will remain over the
waters Wednesday and Thursday. A weakening front will arrive on
Friday before a stronger system sweeps across the waters Friday
night into Saturday.

Double digit seas will gradually drop below 10 feet by tonight and
remain there through much of the week ahead before building again
this weekend as a series of frontal systems reach the waters. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No river flooding is expected in the next 7 days. The
systems this weekend into early next week will need to be monitored
with rises on area rivers forecast, though relatively lower snow
levels should help limit the overall flood potential.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
