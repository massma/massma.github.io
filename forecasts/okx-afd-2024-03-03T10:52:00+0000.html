.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Minor update to temperatures and dewpoints to better reflect
current conditions. Otherwise, forecast remains on track.

Lingering low level moisture from a departing low will keep
patchy fog across most of the area through early this morning.

High pressure then builds into the region today, along with upper
level ridging. Clouds will persist through the morning, but should
begin to clear up by this afternoon as drier air advects across the
area. Temperatures today will be in the 60s which is well above
normal.

Dry weather continues tonight, along with partly cloudy skies as
high pressure remains in control. Lows will be mild and only in the
40s for most spots, but may be near 50 in the NYC metro.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...
Monday is expected to start out quiet with temperatures mostly in
the 50s. Moisture will then increase ahead of an area of low
pressure lifting north from the Carolina coast, bringing an increase
of rain to the area late Monday night into Tuesday afternoon. This
low will lift northward into the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday moving
toward New England by Tuesday night.

Temperatures on Tuesday will be in the upper 40s to low 50s with
nighttime lows in the mid to upper 40s.

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
Jet streak SW to NE north of the area, right rear quad will be
closer to region for Wednesday into Thursday. Surface wave of low
pressure moves in.

Another low pressure wave approaches for next weekend along with a
SW to NE jet streak aloft that be moving north into the area.

Some uncertainty on ending of one low pressure wave`s precipitation
and start of next low pressure wave`s precipitation. Precipitation
type will be plain rain for much of the event timeframe for both low
pressure events.

Gusty easterly flow will make for less of a diurnal temperature
range. Forecast high temperature exhibit a cooling trend Wednesday
into next weekend.
