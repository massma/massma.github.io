.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Active weather will remain for the next several days
across western Washington. An atmospheric river will bring heavier
rain, gusty winds, and mountain winter weather into early Wednesday.
Additional systems will move across the area at times into the
beginning of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Latest radar imagery shows
the back end of warm frontal precip continuing to creep northward,
allowing for activity over the southern half-ish of the CWA to
become more scattered as well as easing rainfall rates as well. The
northern two-thirds of the Olympic Peninsula, the central Sound area
/including the northern half of the Seattle metro area/ and the
northwest interior still on tap for consistent rainfall this evening
and into early tonight. It is worth noting that there is a little
bit of a rain shadow in place over portions of Skagit and Snohomish
counties at the time of this writing /710 PM PST/, however latest
trends suggest the resulting hole in the echoes is starting to fill
in, so any respite from the rainfall in those locations may be
drawing to a close. While only starting to emerge on the outer
periphery of the radar mosaic, the quick-following cold front is
better visible on satellite. This feature will bring another slug of
rainfall to the area as well as wind speeds as advertised in current
headlines for the interior locations within the advisory area.
Coastal locations under the High Wind Warning have been meeting
criteria this evening and that threat will persist as the incoming
cold front moves in overnight.

All of that being said, inherited forecast in on track and will not
need any updates at this time. For additional forecast details, and
there are many, please refer to the Previous Discussion section
below.

From Previous Discussion...We`re well into a period of active
weather in the PNW. An occluded low center just west of Haida Gwaii
is steering a weak atmospheric river into western Washington with
PWAT values up to 1.20-1.30" given recent RAP analysis. This feature
is expected to persist into Wednesday morning with up to 2.00-4.00"
inches of rainfall for the Cascades and 3.00-6.00" for the Olympics.
1.00-3.00" is at play for the coast with lower amounts (0.50-2.00")
for the interior lowlands with rain shadowing helping to trim down
those totals. Hydrologic flooding along the Skokomish river is
happening with more information provided below in the hydro section.

Along with rainfall, wintry precipitation is ongoing in the
mountains with snow fall up of 4.00-8.00" expected for the passes
this afternoon. However, a warm front currently along the coast
will spread inland this evening. The PSL Wind Profiler at Forks
shows snow levels near 8,000 ft on the western fringe of the
Olympics. This warm column of air extending towards the Cascades
will act in concert with cold, shallow air at the passes provided
by easterly winds. This set up will bring a period of freezing
rain this evening into tonight up on the mountains. An onshore
switch will bring warmer surface temperatures to these parts,
allowing warmer rain to return. Ice accumulations up to 0.10-0.20"
of an inch is possible for tonight at the passes.


Wind will also be of concern this afternoon into early Wednesday
morning. The sub 990mb surface low just west of Haida Gwaii has
helped to tighten gradients as it interacts with surface high
pressure over the Inland Northwest. As a result, a Wind Advisory
has been issued for all of western Washington lowlands beginning
this evening into early Wednesday morning. HREF guidance indicates
a large swath of the probability for wind gusts exceeding 45 mph
around 70-80%. Gusty winds could blow around unsecured objects. A
High Wind warning is in effect along the coast as HREF
probabilities of gusts exceeding 55 mph are pinging around 70-80%.
Pretty significant. Damaging winds can blow down trees and power
lines with widespread power outages expected for areas in the High
Wind Warning from Cape Elizabeth to La Push, and along the
immediate coastline. Winds should subside into Wednesday morning.

If those impacts aren`t enough, coastal flooding is an issue as an
advisory is in effect for the coast for minor flooding through
this evening. Additional minor flooding in possible tomorrow for
San Juan County and the Northern Interior around high tide.

As mentioned, rainfall and wind is expected to taper off into
Wednesday as a cold front pushes east of the Cascades. However, a
convergence zone may linger across Snohomish and northern King
Counties Wednesday morning for a brief period of heavier rainfall
after the frontal passage. Upper-ridging will allow for a brief
spell of drier weather Wednesday evening. But of course, it won`t
be long lasting as deterministic guidance has a weak front
entering on Thursday with light rain. We`ll rinse and repeat
Thursday night into Friday with a similar pattern. High
temperatures will top out in the 50s with lows generally in the
40s with some upper 30s in the short term forecast.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...From Previous
Discussion...Ridging builds further across the intermountain west
into Saturday. However, western WA will be on the western fringe of
the upper ridge, allowing for PoPs later in the week. A frontal
system moves towards the Pacific Northwest later Saturday into
Sunday, increasing the risk for lowland rain and higher elevation
mountain snowfall. The active pattern will then continue into next
week as highlighted by the CPC Week-2 hazard outlook for a moderate
risk in heavy precipitation, high winds, and heavy mountain
snowfall.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly to west flow aloft as a front moves
through W WA this afternoon. Steady rain, heavy at times, has
begun moving throughout the area terminals, with conditions
varying between MVFR/IFR. Localized spots of LIFR observed at
times with lower visibilities due to heavier rain passing over
terminals. This will continue to be the trend throughout the
evening and into the overnight as rain will likely reduce
visibilities at times between 2-5SM, keeping conditions MVFR/IFR
into Wednesday morning. Rain will quickly cease following the
frontal passage Wednesday morning by around 15Z for the interior.
Conditions look to raise to VFR by Wednesday afternoon.

Very strong winds persist through the coastal terminals (gusts up
to 50 kt) and the Southwest Interior (OLM, gusts up to 25 to 30)
this evening, with winds slow to increase through the remainder of
the area. Southerly winds will increase through the interior
later tonight (by around 06-09Z) with winds near the interior
terminals ranging around 15 to 25 kts and gusts up to 35 to 40
kts. Winds will peak overnight into early Wednesday morning. Gusty
winds should begin to decrease Wednesday afternoon.

KSEA...MVFR conditions at the terminal this evening with rain.
Both ceilings and visibility are impacted, with visibility ranging
from 3-5 SM, potentially lower in the heaviest bands. A bounce
around to MVFR/IFR is possible through Wednesday morning as rain
persists. Southerly winds will increase late tonight into
Wednesday morning, with sustained winds 15 to 25 kts and gusts
possible up to 30 to 40 kts. The highest winds will peak around
05z-09z, with wind speeds gradually decreasing by 12z Wednesday.
Rain will end steadily Wednesday morning after around 15Z, with a
return to VFR conditions by Wednesday afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A front will continue to move through the area waters
tonight into Wednesday morning, bringing elevated winds and seas.
Southerly winds up to gale force will continue across the coastal
waters and most of the interior waters (with the exception of the
Central Strait of Juan de Fuca, which remains in a Small Craft
Advisory) These southerly winds will transition westerly once the
front passes Wednesday morning, with additional headlines likely
needed after the initial southerly wind direction with a push of
westerlies down the strait Wednesday mid-day.

Active weather will only continue as another system on Thursday
looks to deliver another round of gusty winds over the coastal
waters, with perhaps multiple impactful systems this weekend and
into early next week.

Coastal seas will build this afternoon upwards to around 13 to 16
feet, decreasing into Wednesday but remaining above 10 feet.
Latest guidance seems to be hinting at seas reaching 20 feet early
next week as additional systems impact the area.

.HYDROLOGY...An atmospheric river impacting the region will bring
about 3 to 5 inches of rain to the Olympic Peninsula and portions
of the North Cascades tonight into Wednesday as snow levels rise
to 7000 to 8000 ft. At this time, only the Skokomish River is
expected to rise into flood stage. However, expect other area
rivers along the central and North Cascades to experience rises
and approach Action Stage.

Additional incoming precipitation from wet systems later in the
week and into next week will maintain the threat of river flooding
across western Washington, but models continue to show large
discrepancies and the forecast remains uncertain at this time.
