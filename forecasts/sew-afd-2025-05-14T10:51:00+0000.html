Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
351 AM PDT Wed May 14 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A passing disturbance will bring stronger onshore flow and
additional showers across the region today. Transient high
pressure builds late Wednesday through Thursday, but the next
frontal system quickly follows. An unsettled weather pattern
will remain in place across the Pacific Northwest this weekend
through early next week, maintaining widespread clouds and rain
showers.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Widespread low clouds across the region this morning with some
light rain showers evident in data from NWS radar this morning.
With the dominant upper trough remaining over the Great Basin,
expect stronger onshore flow to again develop later this
morning, aided by a shortwave dropping through southwestern
British Columbia. Expect increased shower activity this morning
near and east of northern Puget Sound, extending eastward
through the Cascades. A Puget Sound Convergence Zone is likely
to develop this afternoon and evening, bringing an additional
focus for shower activity across central Puget Sound eastward
into the Cascades. That said, QPF remains rather modest.

Expect some drying out to occur late this evening through early
Thursday (outside of the previously mentioned PSCZ) as heights
rises a bit with a transient upper level ridge in between the
main weather features. That said, this will be a short-lived
break, as the next frontal system will approach the coastline by
early Thursday and bring yet another round of increased rain
activity. This will knock a few degrees off of the daytime high
temperatures, with the lowlands topping out in the mid 50s to
lower 60s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The long term period looks to feature an extended unsettled
pattern, with an upper trough developing across the Pacific
Northwest. There remains broad support in the ensemble guidance
for this outcome, with fairly solid cloud cover and several
rounds of showers. That said, the amounts aren`t too impressive
in any single time period, but the Friday night/Saturday period
might be the wettest time period of the week ahead. The region
will remain in a rather zonal pattern for the start of next week
which will continue shower chances. Temperatures generally in
the lower 60s through the interior lowlands for the start of
next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light showers early this morning with majority of
terminals currently MVFR as low stratus pushes across the region,
while terminals to the north are VFR. Improvement in ceilings is
expected Wednesday afternoon to VFR, generally after 20z-23z.
However, ceilings are expected to lower once again overnight on
Thursday ahead of an incoming frontal system. Generally
south/southwesterly winds 5-10 kt. A strong westerly push across the
Strait on Wednesday will turn winds northerly from BFI north along
Puget Sound, including PAE.

KSEA...MVFR conditions will persist into late Wednesday morning.
Guidance hints at VFR ceilings returning in the afternoon (after
22z). However, MVFR ceilings are expected to return into Thursday`s
overnight hours. Southerly/southwesterly winds 7-10 kt through the
TAF period. Northerly winds still look to remain to the north of the
terminal Wednesday afternoon/evening.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the Pacific will maintain onshore flow,
bringing another round of strong westerlies over the Strait of Juan
de Fuca Wednesday evening, for which the Small Craft Advisory has
been extended. High pressure will weaken on Thursday as the next
frontal system moves across the waters Thursday into Friday. High
pressure will rebuild over the waters into the weekend.

Seas 7 to 9 ft on Wednesday, becoming 4 to 6 ft by Thursday. Seas
rise again on Friday to 6 to 8 ft and may increase to 10 ft by
Sunday.
