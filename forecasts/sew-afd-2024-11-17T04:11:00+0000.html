Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
811 PM PST Sat Nov 16 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong storm system moves into the region
maintaining gusty winds and widespread precipitation across the
area into Sunday. Unsettled conditions Sunday night and Monday.
Another strong frontal system approaches late Tuesday and pushes
through the area into Wednesday. An active pattern then likely
continues through late in the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Winds will ease across
western WA this evening, including strong winds over the Admiralty
Inlet area and San Juan Islands. Meanwhile, it`s snowing in the
Cascade passes but snow levels will be rising overnight with snow
changing over to rain. Snow levels will lower again on Sunday with
more heavy snow expected and the Winter Storm Warning remains in
effect. 33

Previous discussion...Steady rain continues to advance across the
region ahead of the approaching frontal system. Snow levels
initially around 2000-3000 feet early this morning will climb
significantly in the warm sector of the frontal system. The NOAA
PSL profiler at Forks has indicated a jump to around 8000 ft or so
as of early this afternoon. As we continue to see moisture moving
into the region, the warmer air will bring snow levels to around
4500 feet or so in the North Cascades and closer to the values
that we`re seeing near the coast in the far southern Cascades.
Meanwhile, gusty winds will continue to be the story ahead of the
frontal passage. Winds at NAS Whidbey Island continue to gust to
around 50-60 mph and will remain strong through the evening. While
gusts away from the eastern Strait/Admiralty Inlet and San Juan
Islands won`t be nearly as strong, widespread gusts in to the
20-30 mph remain expected overnight.

As the front sweeps through early Sunday, a much cooler air mass
returns in behind the front and brings snow levels lowering back
down to around 3500 feet through the day Sunday and to around 2000
feet by Sunday night. This will be the push of heaviest snow
through the Cascades and the focus for the current Winter Storm
Warning which remains on track and unchanged at this time. A few
isolated thunderstorms could develop along the coast into the
afternoon as lapse rates steepen with the colder air aloft. These
could push as far east as the Olympics and Lower Chehalis Valley.

With the upper level trough still overhead into Monday, continued
showers are expected over the area. A post-frontal convergence
zone will likely develop near the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca
and extend east-southeast into the Cascades, serving as a focus
for additional showers and possibly a thunderstorm or two.

In additional to these other hazards, the combination of lower
than average pressure and higher high tides will maintain a
continued risk of coastal flooding during the higher of the high
tides each day. Meanwhile, the hydrology section will discuss
river flood potential.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Another strong frontal
system will approach the region late Tuesday as a rapidly
deepening low pressure system over the far northeastern Pacific
begins to shift toward Vancouver Island. Confidence has increased
in the potential for some stronger winds across portions of
Western Washington as this system approaches. Additionally, there
is a signal for locally heavier precipitation as this plume of
moisture focuses somewhere in the Pacific Northwest. Additionally,
while confidence is a bit lower later in the week, there remains
the potential for continued moisture through much of the week.
Various differences in when the low might cut off, would shift the
potential for a drier day toward Thursday or Friday, but not
enough of a signal to remove any mention for now. Meanwhile, snow
levels would likely remain in the generally 4000 ft range,
maintaining the potential for heavier snow in the higher Cascade
elevations later in the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West-northwest flow aloft turning more westerly as an
upper level ridge flattens ahead of the next frontal system,
becoming southwesterly by Sunday afternoon. Surface winds largely
southerly, however with some slight shifts to either southwest or
southeast depending on location and terrain. SEA, BFI and CLM seeing
weakest speeds, generally less than 5 kts while remaining terminals
seeing speeds mostly 15-20 kts with gusts to 30 kts. HQM largely in
a class by itself with speeds 20-25 kts with gusts to 35 kts. Speeds
will ease significantly overnight to around 5-10 kts.

Mostly MVFR to IFR conditions throughout W WA this evening, however
portions of the south Sound /near and around Tacoma/ and along the
Strait seeing some VFR conditions as of 7 PM PST. The hole over the
south Sound should fill in with low clouds while progs for CLM
leaning toward continued low-end VFR conditions there. Should the
site see any precip, though, periods of MVFR conditions can be
expected periodically. Most TAF sites will see improvement to VFR
conditions by late afternoon Sunday, however those locations more
prone to lower cigs /OLM, HQM, PWT/ as well as PAE, likely to see
MVFR conditions persist through the remainder of the TAF period.

KSEA...MVFR conditions in place and likely to remain that way for
tonight and much of the day Sunday. Cigs appear to recover to low-
end VFR in the late afternoon/early evening...approx 01Z...and could
stay there for at least some of the evening hours. Rate of approach
of next system will determine when Sunday night conditions will
return to MVFR. SW winds running lower than guidance at the time of
this writing /730 PM PST/ with speeds 4-8 kts. Most progs have those
speeds ramping back up tonight to 10-15 kts, however only a few
models showing prospect of gusts 20-25 kts. Will assess for 06Z TAF
issuance, but will leave out for now. Cigs slowly recover throughout
the day, but likely will not get back into VFR conditions until
later afternoon/early evening.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system will will continue to pass through the
region tonight, allowing active weather to continue. Gales have
wrapped up over coastal waters, however seas remain high. Thus a
Small Craft Advisory remains in place there to cover said seas of 10
to 12 ft tonight into Sunday before rising to 12 to 18 ft Sunday
night. These seas look to persist into early next week. The
inherited SCA for inland waters will continue before expiring into
early Sunday morning. Models have been consistent in keeping an
intense sub 960-millibar surface low deepening over the offshore
waters Tuesday night in the forecast. There is uncertainty regarding
the track and strength of this system, but ensembles are hinting at
the possibility of some large seas (20+) in our coastal water zones.
In addition, wind speeds over the coastal waters may reach Storm
Force criteria Tuesday evening.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Another round of widespread precipitation this
weekend as a front moves through the area Sunday. Precipitation
forecasts remain similar with around 2-3.5 inches in the mountains
and 0.5-1.25 inches in the lowlands through late Sunday evening. Snow
levels will fluctuate quite rapidly, with snow levels rising up
to 4500-7000 feet tonight then back down to 2000-2500 feet Sunday
night and a little lower Monday. Expect rises on area rivers, with
the largest rises again expected on the rivers flowing off of the
Olympics. A flood warning has been issued for the Skokomish River
in Mason County, which is expected to reach flood stage early
Sunday.today,

A warmer air mass will arrive in the middle of the week, with some
indications of another atmospheric river setting up somewhere
over or near the region later in the week. This would have the
potential to bring steadier rain and higher snow levels, which
could lead to the potential for additional flooding late in the
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
