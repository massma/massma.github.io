.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light precipitation will taper off today. Breezy
easterly winds will develop through the Cascade gaps ahead of the
next system arriving Thursday night into Friday. A wet weekend is
favored before somewhat drier conditions arrive next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Precipitation is generally tapering off across western
WA this morning. There were a handful of automated reports of
unknown precipitation this morning with generally indicates a rain
snow mix but no accumulation has been seen on webcams or reported
this morning. Generally improving conditions are expected today,
and while mostly cloudy skies are likely, a few sunbreaks will be
possible during the day. The current forecast is on track and no
updates are needed this morning.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Light rain is progressing
through the region early this morning, with temperatures in the
low to mid 30s along the eastern Olympic Peninsula, as well as the
Cascade foothills. Despite the colder temperatures in certain
locations, the precipitation so far does not seem heavy enough to
drag the snow levels down appreciably to see much in the way of a
mixed phase type of precipitation for areas less than around 500
feet in elevation. For some of the higher terrain in the
aforementioned areas, particularly west of Hoodsport and near Lake
Cushman, a fleeting accumulation of a half an inch of snow has at
least a 40 to 50 percent chance of occuring through 0300 AM local
time. Similar probabilities exist south of the I-90 corridor in
the higher terrain adjacent to highway 18. Generally,
precipitation will begin to taper off this afternoon.

A brief period of ridging will set up early on Thursday, but the
next upper level trough approaches later in the day on Thursday,
impacting the area into Friday. Easterly winds will strengthen
Thursday night into Friday through the Cascade gaps, with gusts in
the 15 to 25 mph range. Since the last evaluation of the pattern,
probabilities in wind gusts greater than 30 mph have come down,
but it warrants watching as the track of the low pressure system
becomes better known. 24 hour QPF from Thursday afternoon through
Friday afternoon ranges from around an inch in the mountains and
around three quarters of an inch in the lowlands.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Additional waves of
precipitation will arrive through the weekend, each bringing
another quarter inch of rain to the lowlands. Mountain snow totals
from Friday afternoon through Sunday afternoon range from
five to ten inches near Snoqualmie Pass, and around 12 to 15
inches for Stevens Pass. Thereafter, A ridge sets up over the
broader west coast through Tuesday, but what kind of weather sets
up for the PNW depends on where that ridge axis is located.
Systems sliding into the area from the north depend on where this
ridge ultimately decides to form. Any more amplification
thereafter, and it could end up being drier (though given the time
of year, likely not completely dry). Temperatures through
Wednesday appear to be in the low to mid 40s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West-northwesterly flow aloft remaining there until the
overnight hours late tonight/early Thursday morning. Surface winds
southeasterly for much of the Sound area, turning more light and
variable from PAE to points north /including BLI and CLM/. HQM
remains easterly. Speeds at terminals showing a defined wind speed
generally running 4-8 kts.

Mostly MVFR being reported with KHQM being the only station
reporting IFR at the time of this writing. Spotty showers continue
to move through the CWA this morning. Models remain consistent that
cigs will improve in the afternoon with widespread VFR conditions
returning by early evening and persisting for most locations
throughout what is left of the TAF period. The only exception here
will be those locations more prone to lower cigs...such as
OLM...which will likely be impacted by lingering low level moisture
and see MVFR to IFR conditions return tonight.

KSEA...MVFR conditions currently but cigs should lift back to VFR 20-
22z and will continue to lift into the early evening. While lowering
somewhat tonight, will likely remain VFR. Southeasterly winds
shifting more easterly late this afternoon/early this evening around
00Z and remaining there for remainder of TAF period.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An occluded surface low off Haida Gwaii has filled in
this morning, however a stronger surface low further west will keep
gradients as they are before tightening them late tonight. This will
result in an increase in winds, resulting in SCA criteria being met
for the outer coastal waters, while speeds for the inner waters
likely will fall short. That said, seas for all coastal waters
likely to meet or exceed 10 ft through tonight, and as such,
inherited headline has been stretched out to cover both winds and
seas. All coastal waters may require extension into Friday as winds
prove hesitant to relent. Elsewhere, waters should remain outside of
any headline criteria in the short term.

Seas 7 to 9 ft early this morning but will increase to 9 to 11 ft
this afternoon and evening before easing somewhat. That said, the
risk for seas exceeding 10 ft remains in place at least into
Thursday for the outer coastal waters, however the inner coastal
waters may get a slight break. Seas ramp up again late Thursday
night before peaking Friday afternoon at 10 to 13 ft before
gradually easing over the weekend.

.HYDROLOGY...The active weather pattern will promote several
rounds of lowland rain across western Washington though the week
and into this weekend. Snow levels look to increase up to 4000 to
5000 ft beginning late Thursday through the weekend over the
Olympic Peninsula. Each of these systems are fairly progressive,
limiting the total rainfall accumulation with each system. No
river flooding is currently forecast, through the Skokomish River
looks to remain in action stage, getting closer to flood stage
early on Saturday following the warmer system on Friday.
