Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
259 AM PDT Thu May 8 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak disturbance this morning may allow for isolated
showers, otherwise an upper level ridge will begin to build over
Western Washington today into Friday bringing a return to drier
weather. Troughing over the Pacific will shift eastward this
weekend, introducing a chance for showers. A more organized frontal
system at the start of next week will be the best chance for rain in
the forecast.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Current satellite imagery
showing mostly clear skies for at least two-thirds of W WA this
early morning, however an extensive bank of low clouds in place over
much of Snohomish and southern Skagit counties. Isolated lower
clouds also over portions of the Olympic Peninsula, which radar is
picking up very weak echoes associated with them. This seems to gel
with current model solutions pertaining to the minor shortwave
moving through. That said, some isolated spots in the northern
Olympic Peninsula or in that Snohomish/Skagit low cloud bank may see
an isolated light shower here in the early morning, but cannot
imagine activity surviving beyond 8 or 9 AM this morning. Beyond
that, the upper level ridge waltzes into the area by mid-morning and
will build into Friday, resuming dry conditions. High temps today
might be a degree or two cooler in most locations, reaching into the
upper 50s to lower 60s in most spots, however they recover Friday,
getting into the mid 60s to around 70.

Saturday sees the ridge push eastward and an upper low setting up
shop over the eastern Pacific. This feature tries to shunt in some
moisture, however, as it has been with the past couple of fronts to
traverse the area, this system really does not hold together well.
While it does introduce some precip into the forecast, chances only
get into slight chance to low-end chance categories at best for much
of the CWA. It is worth mentioning that the north coast and the
western slopes of the Olympics do see the best chances, hovering
around 50 to 60 pct. This will kick temps down a notch, with highs
Saturday returning to values pretty close to today: upper 50s to the
mid 60s.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Sunday sees the
aforementioned upper low begin to sink southward and start nudging
to the east, bringing better chances for showers area-wide for much
of the day and into Monday. There are some suggestions for a shot of
instability during a very short period late Sunday afternoon and
Sunday evening, possibly resulting in a rumble of thunder or two.
Looking at LIs and CAPE, as well as antecedent conditions...cannot
say there is much confidence in this possibility at this time.
Ingredients just do not seem to be there as it would be preferable
to see this system interacting with a warmer air mass than what will
be in place at this point in the forecast.

Models show a wide range of solutions on the track of this low
Monday night and beyond...some bringing the system straight into WA
while others have it sinking as far south as central CA before
moving eastward. Needless to say, this track is going to make a big
difference in how much precip W WA receives. NBM probably has the
best expectation during the remainder of the forecast cycle:
nuisance PoPs, generally 10-30 pct, lingering over the area. It
keeps rain in the forecast while not picking a side on where the
upper low will actually go...probably the best move until a clearer
consensus emerges.

Temps during the extended do not see much change, likely due to the
aforementioned lack of confidence on the storm track, generally
ranging in the upper 50s to lower 60s for most spots.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge will gradually rebuild over the
region today with west to southwest flow aloft. Remnant cloud cover
from an overnight convergence zone will dissipate later this morning
with VFR expected areawide today. Low level onshore flow will
continue to relax this morning then shift increasingly northerly
this afternoon and evening.

KSEA...Areas of high and mid-level cloud will scatter by afternoon
with VFR prevailing today. Surface winds southerly 7 knots or less
early will shift northerly by 18Z rising to 7 to 10 knots this
afternoon. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface ridging will rebuild across the waters today and
remain in place into Friday. A series of weak frontal systems will
reach the area over the weekend into early next week. The main
impact from these will be periodic increases in onshore flow for
possible small craft advisory westerlies in the Strait of Juan de
Fuca. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...The daily hydrology discussion has ended until the
start of the next rainy season; it will only be updated if needed.
