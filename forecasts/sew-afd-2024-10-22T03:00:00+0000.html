Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
800 PM PDT Mon Oct 21 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Showers continue overnight across western Washington
as an upper level disturbance crosses the region. Drier conditions
expected Tuesday into early Wednesday. Cold morning temperatures
possible early Wednesday and again Thursday morning. Active
weather with widespread precipitation likely to return late in
the week through the weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/... <span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Still plenty of scattered
showers over W WA this evening, however earlier thunderstorm
activity pretty much quieted as soon as the sun set. Still a chance
for showers through the overnight hours as the upper level low
shifts westward and a weak ridge starts to build up into the area.
Inherited forecast covers this well, with no need for any evening
updates at this time. For additional forecast details, please refer
to the Previous Discussion section below.

From Previous Discussion...Broad upper level troughing over
Washington extending south and west well into the Pacific will
linger into mid week. An embedded disturbance will swing across
western Washington this afternoon and evening enhancing showers with
a chance of isolated thunderstorms mainly across the south from
around Grays Harbor inland through the I-5 corridor from around
Tacoma southward. The upper trough then swings across the area
tonight through early Tuesday, with some lingering showers becoming
mostly confined to the mountains. Cooler conditions will also linger
over the next few days with snow levels dipping to around 5000 ft.

A slight bump in upper level heights Tuesday will bring mostly
dry conditions and a likely decrease in cloud cover in the
afternoon and into Tuesday night. With weak high pressure and
clearing skies, this will provide for efficient radiational
cooling which could bring overnight temperatures into the mid 30s
in many outlying areas away from the urban centers by daybreak
Wednesday. Some patchy areas of frost can`t be ruled out in some
of the typically cooler sheltered locations. This will again be
the case Wednesday night into Thursday morning - though the
potential for for cloud cover could inhibit this going into the
early morning hours Thursday.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...From Previous
Discussion...Ensemble guidance remains fairly consolidated on the a
pattern shift late in the week with deepening low in the Gulf of
Alaska and a frontal system reaching the Pacific Northwest by around
Friday. This potentially more impactful period of weather into the
weekend includes what looks to be another deep plume of moisture
aimed somewhere in the region this weekend. Current ensemble
guidance is framing this system as a weaker atmospheric river
pattern not uncommon to the Pacific Northwest in early Fall.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft will become westerly tonight
as an upper level trough moves onshore. Scattered showers continue
across portions of Puget Sound up to the Canadian border as weak low
pressure moves inland. Few heavier showers have dropped visibilities
to around 2 miles, otherwise ceilings range from low-end VFR to
MVFR. Widespread MVFR to locally IFR conditions will redevelop
tonight. Shower activity will diminish through the early morning
hours tomorrow. Fog/low stratus development is expected in the fog-
prone spots Tuesday morning - including OLM and PWT. Skies will
begin to clear out more on Tuesday, with a return to widespread VFR
conditions. Winds remain light out of the southwest through the
evening, turning northerly tomorrow.

KSEA...Scattered showers will move through the evening (heavier band
earlier dropped visibilities to 2 sm). Ceilings are expected to
lower again late this evening into early Tuesday morning to MVFR.
Surface winds light early this morning becoming S/SW 5 to 9 knots
this afternoon and evening, and will become northerly after 18-20Z.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak low pressure system will continue to move onshore
over southwestern Washington tonight, brining scattered showers (the
thunder threat has diminished). A broad surface ridge will begin to
build into the area Tuesday and remain through Thursday for rather
tranquil conditions across the waters. The ridge will then shift
east of the Cascades late in the week as a broad and potentially
deep trough moves into the offshore/coastal waters for a return to
active conditions and possible headlines. Seas remain 4 to 6 ft
through most of the week, then beginning to rise close to 10 ft
Saturday as that system approaches the area.

LH/HPR<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...Rivers will continue to recede over the next few
days. Ongoing showers will continue overnight, with expected amounts
on the order of 0.25 to 0.50 inches with little or no impact on
area rivers beyond slowing the drop in flows on many rivers.
Additional river flooding is not expected through the week ahead.
Another round of potentially heavier rainfall is possible over the
weekend, but confidence in the placement of heavy rain remains
low at this time.

.SEW WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
WA...Freeze Watch from late Tuesday night through Thursday morning
     for East Puget Sound Lowlands-Hood Canal Area-Lower
     Chehalis Valley Area-Southwest Interior.

PZ...None.
