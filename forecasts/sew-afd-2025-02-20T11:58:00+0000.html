Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
358 AM PST Thu Feb 20 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Lingering showers across the coast and mountains will
gradually taper through the morning. A brief period of drier
conditions develops later Thursday in between weather systems as a
weak upper ridge moves overhead. Rain increases Friday as the next
warm front approaches and ushers in a deep plume of moisture and a
warmer air mass. An atmospheric river will be focused on the Pacific
Northwest this weekend, maintaining heavy precipitation. An active
pattern continues through early next week with a drier pattern
likely to emerge toward midweek.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Latest NWS radar imagery
depicts a few pockets of showers continuing at this hour. These
are primarily focused along the coast and in the Cascades. These
snow showers will likely bring some additional light accumulation
in the Cascades above 3000 or 3500 ft or so, but not more than an
additional few inches for the passes. Therefore, the winter
weather advisories for the Cascades will end as scheduled at 4 AM.
Outside of a few showers at times as previously mentioned, expect
a drier, albeit still cloudy, day for much of the area with
temperatures reaching around 50 degrees this afternoon. Drier
conditions continue for most through Friday morning.

The active pattern quickly resumes later Friday with the next
disturbance approaching the region. Expect the leading warm front
to reach the area by Friday night, spreading another round of
moisture across the region. In the warm sector, expect the snow
levels to jump and climb to around 6000-7000 ft by Saturday. With
a deep plume of moisture aimed across the region, expect heavy
rain to spread across Western Washington with snow only in the
highest Cascade elevations. Ensemble guidance continues to
highlight the threat for stronger southerly winds across portions
of the area as well. Expect around an inch of rain for the
lowlands around Puget Sound and up to 2-3 inches for the coast and
mountains. Temperatures remain mild with the strong southerly
flow, with afternoon highs reaching into the mid 50s for most.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Heavy rainfall is likely
to continue across the region on Sunday with the atmospheric river
still positioned across the Pacific Northwest. With the mild air
mass and strong southwest flow, expect snow levels to remain high
as well (ranging from 5500 to 7000 feet). This will enhance runoff
and contribute to rises on many area rivers - see the HYDROLOGY
section for additional details about flood potential. Breezy
southerly winds are expected across much of the region as well.
Expect the primary moisture tap to shut off late Sunday night, but
another stronger disturbance will bring renewed heavy rain to
portions of the area on Monday and Tuesday. This brings another
round of gusty winds through the region and widespread rain (and
snow in the high Cascades well above the passes). A break in the
pattern is possible around midweek, and the air mass will remain
rather mild and support afternoon high temperatures reaching into
the mid to upper 50s by Wednesday. Cullen

.AVIATION...Northwest flow aloft will continue across Western
Washington today as a weak upper ridge builds into the region. Low
level onshore flow will relax today then turn offshore tonight. Low
level moisture remains in place and this will continue to produce
MVFR ceilings across much of the area through the morning. These
will gradually lift by afternoon with VFR prevailing mid-afternoon
into this evening under increasing high and mid level moisture.
Gusty southerly surface winds through Puget Sound will ease later
this morning.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings through the morning will gradually lift to VFR
by afternoon with broken/overcast mid and high level moisture
spreading across the area, Gusty southerly surface winds early will
ease to 5 to 7 knots after 18Z this morning.  27

.MARINE...Low level onshore flow will gradually relax today in the
wake of yesterdays frontal system. This will allow conditions to
improve briefly and for existing small craft advisories to expire
across the inland waters. Seas remain over 10 feet across the
coastal waters and will likely extend small craft advisories there
into later today. A weak surface ridge over the waters today will
shift inland tonight turning the flow offshore as a warm front
stalls over the offshore waters. A trailing cold front will catch up
to it and move onshore as an occlusion Friday evening. This will
commence another period of active weather with headlines for wind
and/or seas expected. A vigorous frontal system will sweep across
the waters Saturday into Saturday and is likely to produce gales
across the coastal waters as well as the entrances to the strait.
Another vigorous system will follow quickly on its heels on Sunday.

Looking into early next week, models are converging on the idea of a
sub-985 millibar low lifting northeastward over the offshore waters
and making landfall near the north end Vancouver Island Monday night
or early Tuesday. Confidence in the eventual track and strength is
still somewhat low at this stage, but it warrants watching for the
potential of storm force winds over the coastal waters and seas in
excess of 20 feet.   27

.HYDROLOGY...The Skokomish River at Potlach crested earlier
tonight at around 16.3 ft, or around 0.2 ft below flood stage.
With the river having crested approaching 16.0 ft on the downward
side of the crest, and as hydrologically significant
precipitation has ended, will cancel the flood watch at this time.
No additional river flooding is expected through the next several
days.

The potential for an atmospheric river to bring heavy
precipitation and much higher snow levels to the Pacific Northwest
this weekend through the early part of next week continues to
grow. There remains a high likelihood (greater than 70% chance)
of 3 to 4 inches of rain across the mountains, and around a 40%
chance of seeing a 5+ inch total in the favored locations of the
Olympics and the central Cascades. This heavy rainfall, coupled
with snow levels around 6500 ft or higher during the bulk of the
precipitation, will bring rises on many area rivers and could
bring a handful closer to flood stage. Additionally, the Skokomish
River is expected flood again by around Sunday.
