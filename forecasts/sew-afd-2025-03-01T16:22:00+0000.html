Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
822 AM PST Sat Mar 1 2025

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Patchy dense fog has expanded along the Puget Sound this
morning, causing areas of greatly reduced visibility. However, the
fog layer is fairly shallow and will continue to erode as the sun
comes up. A Dense Fog Advisory has been issued for much of the
interior lowlands through 10 AM PST, and conditions should improve
by the late morning. Otherwise, upper level ridging will maintain
mild and mostly sunny conditions for most of the interior before
the next system slowly moves inland this evening.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridging will continue to keep conditions
dry and warm today. Chances of showers will return on Sunday into
Monday and again Tuesday into Wednesday as a series of weak
troughs move through. The active pattern looks to continue through
late week with no significant impacts.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
stratus over the offshore waters as well as areas of fog
developing in the river valleys. Areas of patchy fog will
continue to develop early this morning. This fog will once again
be quite shallow and should burn away by the late morning.

Clouds will increase today as a frontal system moves westward
towards the region. High temperatures will be notably cooler on
the coast where mostly cloudy conditions prevail all day--in the
low to mid 50s. Elsewhere, conditions will be fairly similar to
yesterday, with highs in the upper 50s to low 60s. Mid to upper
60s may be possible in the Cascade valleys.

Rain showers will arrive along the coast this afternoon, slowly
spreading inland overnight and continuing into Sunday and early
Monday. In the 36 hours ending Monday morning, total rainfall
amounts will be on on the order of one to two tenths of an inch
through most of the lowlands, with up to half an inch possible in
the mountains and along the Pacific coast. In an essence, Sunday
and Monday will be cool and drizzly. High temperatures will be
around 50 with low temperatures in the 40s.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Increasing confidence that
Tuesday morning will be mostly dry as western Washington will lie
between two systems with a transient upper level ridge overhead.
The next trough will move through Tuesday night into Wednesday for
another round of light precipitation. Snow levels will lower to
around 3000 ft, allowing for light snow accumulations at the
passes during this time period. An upper level ridge looks to
build over the east Pacific Thursday into Friday with the trough
being pushed to the southeast. There`s a wide variety of potential
solutions to this setup depending on how prominent the ridge
becomes and how far east the trough goes. If the trough remains
closer towards California (with a higher amplitude ridge pushing
the jet into British Columbia), these are the drier solutions
which comprise about 45% of the total members. The remaining 55%
of solutions the trough is pushed towards the central U.S. with a
lower amplitude ridge and the jet stream aimed closer towards
Washington. This comprises the wetter solutions and may
potentially point towards the beginnings of a potential
atmospheric river setup. More to come as we get closer to next
weekend.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge is shifting east this morning. An upper
level trough and associated splitting front will dig south offshore
into Sunday with the front staying offshore. Flow is light in the
lower levels.

Areas of fog this morning in most of Puget Sound/South Interior will
clear out by 18-20Z late this morning, as middle and high level
clouds increase today. Ceilings will lower tonight with widespread
MVFR ceilings after 09z. Winds will remain light under 5 kt.

KSEA...Fog has dropped down into the terminal from the west. Appears
to be shallow in depth and once high clouds build back in, the fog
will dissipate between 18-20Z. Ceilings lowering to MVFR around 09z
tonight. Variable winds 5 knots or less.
