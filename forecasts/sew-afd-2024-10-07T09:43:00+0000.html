Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
243 AM PDT Mon Oct 7 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The warmest day of the week will likely be today, as
temperatures climb into the low 70s. The relative warmth will be
short lived as a weak front makes its way into the region tonight
into Tuesday. Shower chances linger into the late week, with more
warming possible next weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A foggy start to the day
will commence what will be the warmest day of the week. Fog is
expected throughout a good portion of Puget Sound and the
southwest interior, but will burn off later this morning.
Temperatures in the low to mid 70s are expected. That said, the
warmer temperatures will give way to a weak frontal system tonight
moving in off the British Columbia coast, for light rain
throughout western Washington. This front will linger and continue
to drift south into Tuesday, with only a few hundredths of an
inch of rain expected across the majority of the forecast area.
The most rain, around a quarter to half inch, will be confined to
the far northwestern Olympic peninsula.

Through Wednesday, the broad troughing pattern will linger over
the north Pacific, sending weak impulses into Washington. Very
light rain is expected, with cloudy skies and cooler temperatures
in the forecast.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...By Thursday, weak high
pressure builds into the area, providing a break in the cooler and
damp conditions. By Friday, there is better agreement amongst the
cluster analysis and ensembles that the broad area of low pressure
returns to the coast, bringing about more light precipitation.
Thereafter, a ridging pattern over a large portion of the CONUS is
favored, but the location of the ridge axis will be key in
determining potential weather influence over western Washington.
The only change in the 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks from the
Climate Prediction Center shows western Washington now slightly
favored for above average precipitation, but the high
probabilities for above average temperatures also persist.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak upper level troughing and a ridge well to the east
will keep flow aloft southwesterly today and into Tuesday. Light and
variable surface winds over much of W WA this early morning before
turning southerly this afternoon in advance of approaching weak
front. Surface winds speeds will generally range 4 to 8
kts...occasionally up to 10 kts along the coast.

ALthough most of the area is reporting VFR conditions, already
starting to see some MVFR to IFR conditions as well as visibility
reductions. Increasing low-level moisture in advance of the
aforementioned front likely playing a role in that as well as many
obs sites not showing much of a gap between temps and dewpts. While
models continue to suggest low clouds and fog being a more
widespread issue than 24 hours ago, timing, impact and extent are
where details get...is it worth the pun...foggy. Current TAFs handle
these prospects with TEMPO groups and continue to feel this is the
way to go until when...or if...conditions emerge. Those with
aviation concerns this morning will be encouraged to check TAFs
often, as amendments will likely come into play throughout the
morning hours. By noon, cigs and fog will have lifted with
increasing high clouds being the only forecast issue. By the end of
the upcoming TAF period...coastal sites may see low-level clouds,
along with precip, move in with the front...but these impacts may be
just outside the time frame for terminals east of there.

KSEA...Persistence is likely a good forecast with respect to low
cloud formation this morning. That said, not expecting any IFR/LIFR
conditions to impact the terminal until the 13Z to 17Z time
frame...where cigs down to 500ft and vis down to 3SM will be
possible. VFR conditions return after 18Z with high clouds
increasing late in the day. Surface winds light S/SE veering more
S/SW during the afternoon into tonight.  18/27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southerly winds will continue over the coastal waters in
advance of an approaching front...with speeds increasing throughout
the morning and into the afternoon as the system continues eastward.
Models remain consistent that while wind speeds will get close to
SCA criteria, they should remain below thresholds or if they do
exceed 21 kts, it will remain short-lived and/or isolated. Speeds
ease and direction shifts more SW to W Tuesday. Another system on
tap for Wednesday...with winds more westerly...but speeds will be
lower with minimal SCA concerns. Another system is progged for the
weekend.

Seas generally 7 to 9 ft, although a little less right up along the
coast /5 or 6 ft/ and a little more in the outer coastal waters /8
or 9 ft/. These will peak in the morning hours before easing in the
afternoon and evening down to a more uniform 6 to 8 ft, where they
will remain through early Thursday before easing more, down to 4 to
6 ft.
