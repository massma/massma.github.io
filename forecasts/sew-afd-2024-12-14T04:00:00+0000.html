Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
800 PM PST Fri Dec 13 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A strong frontal system moving into Western Washington
tonight and Saturday will produce gusty winds, lowland rain,
mountain snow, and high surf conditions. Coastal flooding is
expected to impact the shorelines throughout the weekend. A series
of additional frontal systems will cross the area into the middle
of next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Current radar shows precip
over much of W WA this evening with the majority of echoes
indicating lighter rainfall rates. There are a couple of bands...one
over the central Sound and another over the southwester portion of
the coast, where some occasional moderate rainfall appear to be
occurring...but even that is only a radar-estimated 0.1 to 0.3 of an
inch per hour. Locations within these bands are also reporting
breezier conditions with occasional gusts while much of the
remaining CWA seeing either light and variable winds or winds with
an easterly component at speeds less than 5 mph.

Inherited forecast still on track as this system continues to move
inland. Winds will increase overnight as direction becomes more
southerly. In the lowlands, rainfall will not be too much of an
issue, while in the mountains, inherited winter headlines still look
to cover forecast conditions and accumulations well. With waves
expected to build quickly during the overnight hours, Coastal
Flooding and High Surf headlines are also in a good place with no
need for updates.

For additional forecast details, please refer to the Previous
Discussion section below.

From Previous Discussion...Light rain continues to gradually spread
northward across the area this afternoon ahead of an approaching
frontal system and associated surface low offshore. The surface low,
now about 400 nautical miles west of Astoria, will continue to
deepen overnight as it lifts northeastward. As it moves into the
Washington offshore waters tonight, gradients will begin to
increase...reaching -8 to -10 millibars between Astoria and
Quillayute by Saturday morning. The surface low is expected to make
landfall over central Vancouver Island by late Saturday morning as
an occluded front sweeps inland across Western Washington. The
strongest winds with this system are expected along the coast and
across interior areas from around Everett northward. This system
will generate high surf along the coast with seas reaching around 20
feet by mid-morning Saturday. All of this will coincide with
Perigean Spring Tides and inundation of 2.5 to 3.5 feet above ground
level on Saturday...for the potential of major coastal flooding
along the coast and moderate coastal flooding along the strait and
San Juans.

Snow levels will gradually fall through the weekend...starting
near 3500 feet tonight and falling to 2000 to 2500 feet by Sunday.
Several inches of snow will fall at the passes where a Winter
Weather Advisory remains in place. Without any strong post-frontal
onshore punch over the weekend, this should limit snowfall totals
in the central Cascades passes, but we`ll need to keep on eye on
Mount Baker where orographics could play a big role. Shortwave
ridging will slide inland on Sunday for a brief transition to
somewhat drier and colder conditions. Another frontal system is
expected to move onshore on Monday, but this system looks to
weaken as it moves onshore as upper level support remains
offshore.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...From Previous Discussion...A
rather active pattern is expected to persist through early next
week, but confidence in timing and any potential impacts is
relatively low. The general trend in the ensembles is to build an
upper level ridge over the Intermountain West by the middle portion
of next week. But therein lies the rub. This places Western
Washington on the periphery of said ridge...and somewhat susceptible
to a potential atmospheric river. The 12Z ECMWF ensembles have keyed
in on this, but other model ensembles are less enthusiastic. For
now, the 7 forecast period is shaping up to end quieter than it
began. But in December, that`s easily subject to change. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow over western Washington as an upper level
trough approaches the area. Rain has filled in through the interior
of western Washington, and periods of steadier rainfall are
resulting in lower cigs and visibility...giving rise to some sites
seeing MVFR or IFR conditions from time to time. Majority of
terminals generally VFR at the time of this writing and should stay
that way through Saturday morning. Increasing winds and persistent
rainfall may allow for more widespread MVFR conditions for much of
Saturday afternoon before conditions start to improve back to VFR in
the evening.

Southeast winds will continue to increase, peaking Saturday morning
and becoming more due southerly. Winds will peak around 15 to 25 kt
with gusts ranging from 25 to 45 kt. The highest gusts will be local
to the Pacific coast and the northern interior terminals (including
PAE and BLI). Winds will continue to veer to southwesterly but begin
to decrease getting into Saturday afternoon.

KSEA...VFR conditions this evening into Saturday morning, although
the combination of rain and winds may reduce vis to 3-5 SM at times
and cause brief periods of MVFR conditions. More consistent MVFR
expected Saturday afternoon...but even this should be more on the
higher side of the category. Improvement back to low-end VFR
expected for Saturday evening. Southeast winds will continue to
increase up to 15 to 20 kt with gusts 25 to 30 kt possible. These
peak winds are expected to occur Saturday morning. Winds will veer
southerly then southwesterly through the day while also gradually
easing.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong low pressure system off the coast of Washington
will continue to move northeastward towards central Vancouver Island
on Saturday, bringing a very active period of weather for the area.
Along the coast, winds gale force winds will persist through
Saturday morning before starting to diminish Saturday afternoon.
Gusts up to 50 kt/storm force are possible during this time period,
especially through the outer coastal waters.

SCA winds in place over the entrances /West and East/ of the Strait
and will increase to gales early Saturday morning. The adjacent
waters of Admiralty Inlet and the Northern Inland Waters will see
similar increases as winds turn more southerly early Saturday
morning, with gales emerging there with similar timing. Puget Sound
and Hood Canal will also see speeds increase, but only to SCA
criteria. Long way of saying inherited headlines look good and will
not be altered/updated this evening.

Winds will begin to ease area-wide Saturday afternoon into Saturday
evening. The calm period will be short lived as another frontal
system will move through the waters Sunday night into Monday where
another round of strong winds through the coastal waters,
potentially reaching gale force through the outer coastal waters (40-
60% probability). Additional systems may move through the area mid-
week keeping conditions active over the area waters.

Seas 10 to 12 ft this afternoon will rapidly rise to 18 to 23 ft
across the area waters tonight. Waves remain over 20 ft through the
coastal waters through Saturday afternoon before subsiding below 10
ft on Sunday. The frontal system Sunday night bring waves back up to
8 to 12 ft by Monday and look to remain above 10 ft through much of
the beginning of next week.

.HYDROLOGY...A stronger storm will move through the area tonight
and into this weekend, for chances of more significant precipitation
to the region. Latest guidance still has been uncertain regarding
rainfall amounts in the Olympics, with overall totals being a
touch higher than previous forecasts. Area rivers will still
rise, with only the Skokomish River being expected to reach near
action stage. Even with the slightly higher QPF amounts, the
Skokomish River still is forecasted to barely reach action stage
on Saturday. This will continued to be monitored as more guidance
becomes available. Additional rounds of precipitation could keep
the Skokomish river at or near flood stage into early next week.
We will continue to monitor the rainfall forecast and the river
forecast for this weekend.
