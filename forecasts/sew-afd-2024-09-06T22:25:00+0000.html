Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
325 PM PDT Fri Sep 6 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Hot and dry conditions will continue across western
Washington through this evening, with a Heat Advisory in effect
for much of the region. Temperatures will moderate over the
weekend as a low pressure system moves across the Pacific
Northwest. Cooler conditions are on track to return next week as
troughing moves across the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Generally clear skies
across Western Washington this afternoon with elevated haze due to
regional wildfires ongoing across southwest WA and into Oregon.
Hot temperatures continue this afternoon with widespread 80s and
90s observed as of 3PM, especially for locations away from the
water. Temperatures are cooling along the immediate coast,
however, as flow slowly transitions onshore, with 230 PM temp at
HQM at 70 degrees. Temperatures will remain elevated for interior
areas tonight, with lows mostly ranging in the upper 50s to mid
60s.

A slow cooling trend will begin on Saturday and continue into
Sunday as onshore flow increases and the ridge axis shifts
eastward and heights lower. In addition, temperatures will likely
also be impacted by increasing elevated smoke with continued
southerly flow aloft. At this time, temperatures are forecast to
be in the 80s in the interior and 70s on the coast, but cooler
temperatures are possible depending on the extent of elevated
smoke. For this reason, the Heat Advisory will be allowed to end
this evening. With that said, Moderate HeatRisk levels will likely
continue on Saturday for some areas of the interior, with Minor
HeatRisk elsewhere. Otherwise, low relative humidities will
continue on Saturday for the Olympics and Cascades, refer to the
.FIRE WEATHER discussion for more information.

The cooling trend will continue on Sunday with further onshore
flow. Elevated smoke will continue into Sunday, with slow
improvement later Sunday afternoon and Sunday night due to
increasing westerly flow aloft as troughing moves across British
Columbia. Will have to monitor the threat of any convection,
mainly later Saturday night into Sunday over the Cascades, but at
this time probabilities remain low on NBM/HREF. Further cooling
then expected Monday with onshore flow and stratus across the
area.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Troughing will deepen
offshore Tuesday with further cooling in temperatures and an
increase in precipitation potential, especially later Tuesday.
Ensembles are in decent agreement of the upper trough moving into
the Pacific Northwest on Wednesday, allowing for a chance of
showers Tuesday night into Wednesday. Troughing will move eastward
Thursday with continued westerly aloft later next week, for
perhaps another period of drier weather. Temperatures generally
will be near to slightly below normal during this period next
week. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge over the region tonight will shift
eastward as an upper level trough moves into the area on Saturday.
West/southwesterly flow will become more southerly tonight into
Saturday as a result. Onshore flow has started to return to the
coastal terminals in the low levels this afternoon. Overall
conditions remain VFR across the region with smoke filtering in
aloft. Expect VFR conditions to continue into Saturday for most
terminals, expect along the coast where stratus will move up and
push inland. IFR/LIFR conditions are likely for KHQM in stratus
through Saturday morning. Conditions for coastal terminals will
improve as stratus looks to retreat back to the coast between
18-21Z. Haze will continue Saturday at area terminals as
additional smoke filters in aloft.

KSEA...VFR conditions with smoke aloft. Northerly winds 4-8 kt
will become light overnight. Winds will increase again to 4-8 kt
by the afternoon on Saturday. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will remain situated over the northeastern
Pacific while a thermal trough along the coast continues to push
inland tonight. Northwesterly winds across the outer coastal waters
will be breezy at times tonight into Saturday, with occasional
gusts to 25 kt. However, guidance does not indicate gusts to be
widespread enough for small craft issuance at this time. Onshore
flow will increase over the weekend, resulting in westerly pushes
down the central and eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca nightly during
the evening and overnight hours. A weak low pressure system may
move into the coastal waters Tuesday into Wednesday.

Seas across the coastal waters will generally hover between 3-7 ft
over the next several days. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper-ridging and an associated surface thermal
trough will continue critical fire weather conditions. Hot, dry, and
unstable conditions will remain through Saturday for the Olympic
zones 652/661 and Cascade zones 658/659. A return to onshore flow
tonight into Saturday will begin to bring cooler, moist air to the
coast and Olympics. However, the marine influence is expected to be
shallow leaving higher elevations within the Olympic mountains still
exposed to low RH values. Something we`ll continue to monitor. Red
Flag Warnings over the mountain zones remain in place for today due
to continued hot, dry and unstable conditions. Also, a less than 10%
chance of showers and thunderstorms exist on Saturday afternoon for
the mountains as well.

Cooler and more moist air will return area-wide on Sunday with the
potential of some wetting rains by mid-week.
