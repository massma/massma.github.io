Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
826 PM PDT Thu Oct 3 2024

.SYNOPSIS...High pressure moves east this afternoon, with
increasing high clouds approaching Western Washington ahead of the
next front. This frontal system will reach the Olympic Peninsula
by daybreak Friday and spread rain across the region through the
day. High pressure returns this weekend for warmer and drier
conditions, but another front brings more rain chances early next
week.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Rain over Neah Bay this
evening and spreading south along the coast tonight. Warmer with
lows in the 40s (no 30s compared to this morning). Wetter day
ahead on Friday for the rest of western WA. Current trends remain
on track. 33

Previous discussion...Skies have become mostly sunny across
Western Washington this afternoon under some passing high clouds.
Cloud cover will increase from the northwest this evening and
especially tonight, however, as the next frontal system continues
to approach the area. Expect rain to reach the coastline after
midnight tonight and continue to spread inland through the day on
Friday. This will bring a fairly solid shot of rain to the region
with around a half inch of rain through the interior lowlands and
about an inch (with local amounts up to one and a half inches)
along the coast and in the mountains. While these amounts are not
likely to cause any significant hydrologic impacts, will need to
monitor the rainfall rates at the peak of the front for two
reasons - first, burn scar areas (such as Bolt Creek) could be
impacted by local bursts of heavy rain (especially in a possible
Puget Sound Convergence Zone later Friday), and second, urban
areas could see some drains and gutters blocked by leaves that
come down and limit the efficiency of draining rain. However, at
this time, either of these impacts remain relatively low
likelihood scenarios.

The arrival of the front and the following cold air will bring
daytime high temperatures several degrees cooler than today with
many spots only topping out in the 50s to around 60 on Friday
afternoon. Snow levels will also fall, but the cold air will trail
the moisture so outside of the highest Cascade elevations snowfall
is not expected to me a major concern. One other note for later
Friday is that stronger onshore flow in the wake of the front may
lead to prolonged showers in a potential Puget Sound Convergence
Zone. With slightly enhanced instability as lapse rates steepen,
could see a lightning strike or two in this area.

High pressure rebuilds over the weekend, allowing daytime high
temperatures to again climb into the upper 60s and near 70 for
Saturday and Sunday through much of the region. Some low clouds
are possible, but plenty of sunshine each afternoon can be
expected.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Ensemble guidance remains
in good agreement for the start next week, with the next frontal
system a touch faster in the latest guidance. This would bring a
return of rain chances to the coast and spreading inland on Monday
with some lingering precipitation through Tuesday. This will again
knock a few degrees off of the temperatures each day and keep more
widespread cloud cover over the region. Later next week, ensemble
solutions remain rather well clustered in depicting a ridge over
the western U.S. but shifting east toward the Four Corners region.
This would open the door to a few weak disturbances clipping parts
of the area. As a result, some mention of precipitation chances
(generally 20-40% remain) for much of next week. Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft will increase overnight ahead of a
frontal system and trailing upper trough approaching the area.
Ceilings will deteriorate to MVFR in rain along the coast late
tonight with said conditions spreading into the interior lowlands
mid to late Friday morning. Ceilings are expected to lift to VFR in
scattered showers behind the front Friday afternoon except in and
around an expected convergence zone Friday evening.
South/southwesterly surface winds will become gusty at times with
and behind the front.

KSEA...Rain will move into the terminal early tomorrow morning,
allowing ceilings to drop to MVFR by mid-morning. Rain will devolve
into showers Friday afternoon, allowing ceilings to slowly lift to
low-end VFR. Surface winds light tonight switching to
south/southwesterly early Friday morning and rising to 10 to 15 kt
with occasional gusts to 20 kt possible after around 20Z. 27/LH<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Winds will ease tonight before turning southerly tomorrow
as a frontal system moves through the area Friday. Winds will
increase across the area waters, with the strongest winds expected
through the Central Strait of Juan de Fuca behind the front, where a
Small Craft Advisory is in effect for Friday. A few gusts up to 35
kt are possible at times, but should largely be confined to the
Canadian side of the Strait. A frontal system will pass by to the
north this weekend, with the next system passing through the waters
early next week.

Seas 7 to 9 ft this afternoon will continue to subside tonight.
Waves will rise up to 10 to 12 ft tomorrow in accordance with the
frontal passage, for which a Small Craft Advisory is in effect for
all the outer coastal zones. For the inner coastal zones, waves will
be highest to the north near the Strait and decrease to the south,
thus leaving out the zone between Point Grenville and Cape
Shoalwater from a Small Craft Advisory. As the system develops and
moves into the region, the forecast can be adjusted as necessary if
waves are higher than currently forecast. By Saturday, seas will
drop back down to 4 to 6 feet before building back to 6 to 8 feet
next week.
