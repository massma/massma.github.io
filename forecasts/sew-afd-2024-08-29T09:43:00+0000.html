Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
243 AM PDT Thu Aug 29 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Dry and incrementally warmer each day over the next
several. High temperatures will be back in the 80s by the weekend.
Cooler conditions and slight chance for more rain due to a passing
weather disturbance are likely by Monday or Tuesday of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Today, expect highs in the
upper 70s and low 80s in the Cascade foothills and southwest
interior. High pressure will continue to exert its influence over
the region through the weekend with afternoon highs getting a few
degrees warmer each day. Right now, the warmest day of the next
several will likely be Saturday with highs topping out in the mid
to upper 80s, with some 90s in low mountain valleys and in areas
south of Olympia. These temperatures translate to widespread
moderate HeatRisk throughout western Washington.

Flow will be offshore for much of this period through the late
week, contributing to the climbing temperatures. The fire weather
discussion will have more specifics, but right now, there is no
considerable threat of a strong, east wind event setting up. Warm
conditions will bring the fuel dryness back to levels expected for
this time of year after having been moistened by recent rains.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...A few degrees of cooling
expected on Sunday, but still a warm day is expected as the ridge
moves east. Onshore flow will resume by early next week and assist
in bringing the temperatures back down into the 70s.

The models are still indicating a cutoff low off the CA/OR border
moving east, but its influence in western Washington at this
point appears limited. Its trajectory takes it ashore in Oregon
and most of the activity is limited to our south. This will help
facilitate a return of that onshore flow, but there is not a
signal for widespread thunderstorms or much in the way of rain
more broadly. This feature will continue to be monitored for
deviations in its path that would change the forecast for western
Washington.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest winds aloft today as ridging tracks overhead.
Winds will then turn more west-southwesterly by Friday. Clear skies
across W WA with the trend last for most throughout the upcoming TAF
period. However, patchy fog this morning for the coast, river
valleys, and in Whatcom County near KBLI for brief LIFR vsbys,
mainly between 12-17z. Lighter winds this morning increasing out of
the north this afternoon before calming at night.

KSEA...Clear skies through the TAF period. NE surface winds will
generally range 5 to 10 knots this morning, increasing from the
north by midday Thursday around 8 to 12 knots with gusts up to 18
knots and gradually relaxing overnight into Friday morning.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>



&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure offshore for the next several days. A
thermally induced low expanding along the Oregon and Washington into
Saturday bringing light offshore flow. Northerly winds will remain
mostly below SCA levels for the coastal waters and inland waters.
Easterly winds are expected throughout the strait but again, below
warning thresholds. Brief SCA wind gusts are possible this evening,
in the central and southern inner Coastal Waters but not sustained
enough for any headlines.

Coastal seas generally around 4 to 6 feet into the weekend before
rising briefly to 5 to 7 feet on Monday.

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will begin to develop east of the
Cascades on Thursday with a thermal trough along the coast. This
will allow winds to turn light offshore over the Cascades starting
Thursday. This will allow relative humidity values to drop into
the 30s, even as low as 20-25% possible in the southern parts of
the Cascades and valleys. Relative humidity recovery will be poor
overnight, only reaching around 40-60%. Area fuels are currently
moist from recent rains, but these conditions will allow them to
dry out quickly. It will be important to monitor how fast fuels
respond, especially as temperatures warm through late week and
instability looks to increase into the holiday weekend.
