National Weather Service Seattle WA
725 PM PDT Fri Apr 25 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Broad surface high pressure will remain in place
through the weekend with gradually cooling temperatures A frontal
system will move through Monday night into Tuesday brining a
chance for light precipitation. Temperatures look to warm once
again late-week as an upper level ridge establishes itself over
the region.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An increase in high clouds
this evening but overall, not much change from 24 hours ago as upper
level ridging remains in control of the weather over W WA.
Widespread temps in the 60s, with some water adjacent locations in
the mid to upper 50s as of 7 PM PDT. As expected on a quiet evening,
inherited forecast remains on track and as such no evening update
will be needed. For additional forecast details, please refer to the
Previous Discussion section below.

From Previous Discussion...Mostly clear skies this afternoon with
quite a bit of cirrus blanketing western Washington. Highs on track
to reach the low 70s across most of the region, with upper 60s along
the coast. Mostly clear skies continue through the weekend with
gradually cooling temperatures each day: highs in the mid to upper
60s, lows in the 40s. Onshore flow may be noticeably breezy at times
Saturday and Sunday afternoon with gusts up to 25 to 30 mph,
particularly west of Olympia and through the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

Split flow aloft this weekend with an upper level low to the south
will give way to more zonal flow by Monday, allowing an upper
level shortwave trough to skirt by to the north over British
Columbia. This will bring an weak surface cold front across the
area Monday night into early Tuesday, bringing for chances for
light rain. Snow levels above 5500 to 6000 ft will mean rain for
all mountain passes. Monday will also be the coolest day, with
highs in the upper 50s to near 60.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Showers will gradually taper
off through the day on Tuesday, with the best chances for rain
continuing across the mountains. An upper level ridge will build
in the system`s wake Wednesday and continuing into Thursday,
allowing for a return to warmer temperatures. Highs Thursday look
to build to the low to mid 70s. Another upper level trough looks
to approach the area Friday into next weekend, but there are
differences in the timing as well as how far south the trough is
expected to dig. In the forecast, slight chances for
precipitation return Thursday night into Friday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Dry weather across western WA tonight and Saturday as
an upper level low spins to our south (over CA). The flow aloft is
light and variable. Onshore flow will increase overnight with low
level stratus clouds covering the coast (with IFR conditions
likely). Low clouds will burn back offshore by mid to late
morning. A stronger onshore push will bring stratus clouds farther
inland Saturday night and Sunday. 33

KSEA...Northerly winds still in the 10-15 kt range this evening
before starting to ease to 4-8 kts after 04Z. Winds easing further
and becoming variable 09-12Z, then becoming W to SW by 18-21Z 5-10
