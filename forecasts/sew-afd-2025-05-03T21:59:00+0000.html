National Weather Service Seattle WA
259 PM PDT Sat May 3 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cool and unsettled weather will persist tonight with a

temperatures and generally dry conditions through the remainder
of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT/...Radar and satellite
imagery showing scattered showers across the area with cloudy
and cooler conditions. Temperatures most areas will struggle
to warm into the low 60s. The upper level trough over the region will
then move off to the east Sunday morning, allowing upper level
ridging to build back into the Pacific Northwest setting the
stage for a warming and drying trend into the first part of
next week. High temperatures on Sunday will reach into the
upper 50s to mid 60s and the mid 60s to low 70s across the
interior on Monday. The will bring minor (Yellow) HeatRisk
values to portions of the interior lowlands - highlighting
impacts to individuals that are extremely sensitive to heat,
especially when outdoors without effective cooling and/or
adequate hydration. Areas along the coast will remain cooler,
with highs generally expected to trend in the low to mid 60s.

&&

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Tuesday continues to
look like the warmest day of the week with afternoon highs in
the mid to upper 60s for areas along the coast and in the 70s
across the interior, with some locations approaching 80. Minor
(Yellow) HeatRisk will become more widespread across the
interior lowlands.

Ensembles continue to generally agree on the upper level ridge
shifting further inland over the central US and troughing will
start to take hold over the northeastern Pacific. The allows the
potential for a weak system to affect the area, with many
solutions showing it brushing western Washington as it moves
into British Columbia. The larger impact may in fact be the
overall transition to cooler typical pattern through late week.

&&

.AVIATION...Westerly flow aloft turning northerly overnight as
upper level troughing shifts eastward allowing upper level ridging
to nudge closer to western Washington. VFR conditions at all area
terminals this afternoon. With an overall improving trend
throughout the day, VFR will likely continue into Sunday morning.
Winds have been all over the place this afternoon, but should
largely lock into a more northwesterly component later this
evening, generally around 5 to 10 knots. KCLM will experience a
stronger SW wind, around 15 to 20 knots.

KSEA...VFR conditions this afternoon as intermittent showers
continue. Shower activity will largely decrease this evening, with
VFR continuing into Sunday. Variable winds this afternoon will
take on a N/NW component this evening, with wind speeds around 8
to 12 knots. Winds will lessen into the overnight hours taking a
more ENE component around 06z-08z.

surface high builds over the coastal waters with lower pressure
inland. A Small Craft Advisory continues for the Central and East
Strait of Juan De Fuca until early Sunday. Light northerly winds
over the coastal waters into the first half of next week, with
general benign marine conditions.

Coastal seas generally hovering around 6 to 8 feet over the
weekend, decreasing to 4 to 6 feet for the first half of next
