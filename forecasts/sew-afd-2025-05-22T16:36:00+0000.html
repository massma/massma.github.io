Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
936 AM PDT Thu May 22 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level trough moving out of the area this
morning. Zonal flow aloft later today into Friday. Upper level
ridge building east of Western Washington over the weekend,
close enough to keep fronts from reaching the area. Upper level
trough arriving Monday with most of the energy moving inland
over Oregon. A stronger upper level ridge will build to the east
again Tuesday and Wednesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Forecast remains on track
this morning with no updates planned.

Upper level trough continuing to move east today pulling the
cloud cover and what little shower activity there is associated
with the trough out of the area this morning. Mostly sunny skies
this afternoon. Weak onshore flow and still a little cool air
aloft keeping high temperatures near normal, in the 60s.

Not much going on tonight and Friday with zonal flow aloft over
Western Washington and frontal systems well to the west.
Temperatures aloft not warming and the low level flow remains
light. This will keep highs Friday near normal once again, in the
60s. The lack of cloud cover overnight will allow the colder
locations like the Southwest Interior to drop into the upper 30s.
Lows for the remainder of the area in the lower to mid 40s.

Upper level low beginning to move south out of the Gulf of Alaska
between 140-150W Friday night into Saturday. This in turn will
build an upper level ridge over Western Washington Friday night
with the ridge axis moving into Eastern Washington Saturday.
Temperatures warming aloft with 500 mb heights getting above 570
dms but northerly flow in the lower levels and increasing onshore
flow late in the day will keep highs from getting too warm. Mid
60s to mid 70s for the interior with the afternoon onshore flow
capping highs along the coast in the lower to mid 60s. Like Friday
morning, the lack of cloud cover overnight into Saturday morning
will allow the colder locations to drop into the upper 30s. Most
places will have lows in the lower to mid 40s.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement with the upper level ridge to the east Sunday and an
approaching upper level trough still offshore. The approaching
trough will turn the flow aloft southerly Sunday afternoon and
evening. Will have to keep an eye out for possible late day
convection over the Cascades.

Trough moving inland over the Pacific Northwest Monday with most
of the energy going inland south of Western Washington. Just a
chance of showers in the forecast with the trough overhead.

Both models build another upper level ridge to the east for
Tuesday and Wednesday. This ridge has much more amplitude than the
ridge over the weekend. The higher amplitude ridge increases the
southerly flow aloft over the area especially Wednesday. Ensemble
solutions are for the most part dry but enough solutions with
light precipitation Wednesday to put a chance of showers in the
forecast.

Highs Sunday in the mid 60s to mid 70s cooling a little for Monday
to the 60s and lower 70s. Temperatures Tuesday and Wednesday
similar to the weekend with southerly flow aloft pumping some
warmer air into the region. Highs in the mid 60s to mid 70s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft will gradually become more
westerly today as a trough swings across the region. Mid to high
cloud cover is currently streaming across western Washington this
morning from a weather system to the south. Light shower activity
has largely diminished but could continue to see some stragglers in
the Cascades as the day progress. Conditions at most terminals
remain VFR this morning, with a few spots reporting MVFR (KBLI and
KPAE). Widespread VFR conditions are then expected to redevelop and
prevail through the remainder of the TAF period.

N/NE surface winds at 4-7 kts will transition to more N/NW and
increase to 5-10 kts by this afternoon.

KSEA...VFR conditions expected through the TAF period, with
increasing mid and high cloud cover this morning. Winds NE at 4-7
kts will shift to the W/NW and increase to 5-10 kts this afternoon
before gradually becoming lighter and southerly overnight.

.MARINE...
High pressure will build over the area waters today and
persist through the weekend. A frontal system associated with a
low pressure system over the Gulf of Alaska will approach Vancouver
Island on Friday, but looks to dissipate before making it into
the Washington waters. Do not expect much in the way of impact
from this system across the area waters at this time- however
this will allow for northerly winds across the coastal waters to
gradually transition back to southerly over the weekend. Diurnal
westerly pushes are expected along the central and eastern Strait
of Juan de Fuca over the next few evenings. May see wind gusts
briefly approach small craft criteria with the onshore push
tonight, but do not expect gusts to be frequent or widespread- so
held off on a small craft issuance for now.

A front will then move into the area waters on Monday, with high
pressure building back into the coastal waters in its wake.

Seas across the coastal waters are 4-6 ft this morning and will
continue to subside towards 3-5 ft on Friday. A slight uptick in
seas is expected again Saturday night into Sunday, with seas
building towards 5-7 ft. Seas then look to persist within this
range through the early part of next week.
