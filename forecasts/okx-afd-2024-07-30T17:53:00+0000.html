Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
153 PM EDT Tue Jul 30 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
A weak frontal system approaches the area from the west late
today and moves through the area into Wednesday. A series of
weak fronts then move through the area Thursday through Sunday.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Temps bumped up a bit, especially across the NYC metro and
points north and west with a few 90s possible across urban NE
NJ.

With the upper low well to the north today, shortwave ridging
will briefly move across the area ahead of another trough
approaching from the Ohio Valley. This should limit any convection
until later this afternoon and mainly north and west of the NYC
metro. In fact, with the approach of the western trough, a line
of convection is forecast to track east across PA. However,
this would not get into western portions of the forecast area
until late tonight. Latest CAMs dissipate the line likely due to
the loss of daytime instability. The question is will there
be enough lift to at least maintain scattered convection. For
the time, will leave rain chances tonight as is and take a
look at the latest HREF and some of the other 12Z guidance
before making adjustments.

Otherwise, expect dry conditions with clearing skies and highs
in the middle to upper 80s. A strengthening southerly flow
(gusts 20 to 30 mph) will advect additional moisture to allow
PWAT values of 1.8-2" into tonight. So any convection will be
capable of brief heavy rainfall.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
The frontal system remains in the vicinity of the area on
Wednesday with multiple rounds of unorganized shower and
thunderstorm activity likely. Coverage and timing of this
activity is fairly uncertain as the environment remains moist
and relatively unstable. Otherwise, overcast skies are expected
with highs in the low to middle 80s. The NYC metro may approach
90 depending on the extent of the shower and thunderstorm
activity.

The cold front is expected to push through the area sometime in
the afternoon or overnight Wednesday. While this should result
in diminished shower/storm activity into Wednesday night, there
won`t be much of a change in airmass as dew points are still expected
to be in the low 70s, though skies should clear a bit. Lows will
be in the low to middle 70s.

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
Key Points:

* Multiple rounds of showers and thunderstorms possible mid week
  into the weekend.

* 95 to 100F heat indices possible Thu thru Sun, particularly for
  northeastern New Jersey, the lower Hudson Valley, New York City,
  and portions of northwestern Long Island and SW CT.

An active upper flow through the period, with area on northern
periphery of SW/SC US upper ridging and Bermuda upper ridging. More
distinct features are northern shortwave troughing approaching on
Wed and gradually sliding east on Thu. Brief shortwave upper ridging
on Friday, followed by the next northern shortwave/closed low
digging into the Great Lakes/Ohio valley Thu Night/Friday before
gradually shearing through the NE through the weekend.

Surface trough approaches Wed AM, with ongoing shower/embedded tsra
activity coincident with theta-e rich and marginally unstable
airmass advecting in on 35-40 kt llj. This activity likely slides
east through the morning as the initial trough moves east. This
trough will likely be replaced by a subsequent
approaching/developing trough with potential for additional
scattered shower/tstms activity in aft/eve, particularly across
areas from NYC and N&W.

Low/mid level environment gradually dries out Wed Night Into Thu in
wake of this trough. Upper troughing remains on Thursday, with
surface trough approach/development once again Thu aft. A drying
airmass on deep westerly flow should limit instability and moisture,
keeping shra/tsra activity limited. Heat should begin building on
Thu with deep mixing and downslope flow, with more in the way of
sunshine. Highs in the upper 80s to lower 90s, with heat indices in
the lower to mid 90s.

Shortwave ridging surface/aloft on Friday should allow for heat and
humidity to continue to build, before potential for late day/evening
shra/tsra activity with approaching convectively enhanced shortwave
energy ahead of deepening Great Lakes/Ohio Valley upper low.

Thursday and Friday could be the hottest air temps of the period
with westerly flow aloft and deep mixing, with widespread highs in
the upper 80s to lower 90s likely, and possibly running as high as
the lower to mid 90s away from south coasts. Heat indices in the
lower to mid 90s, with upper 90s for NYC/NJ metro and Lower Hud.

Weakening mean upper troughing Saturday into Sunday as Great
Lakes/Ohio Valley trough shears NE. Lead shortwave and trough axis,
along with surface troughs moving across the area will continue
potential for aft/eve shra/tsra activity. Air temps may not be as
high for the weekend with approaching troughing, but a deepening
southerly flow will likely allow for a moistening profile and TDs
increasing. So net result would likely be continued widespread heat
indices in the lower to mid 90s, with upper 90s for NYC/NJ metro and
Lower Hud, and surroundings.

Heat advisories may be needed Thu into Sun with the possibility of
multiple days reaching heat indices of at least 95 degrees across at
least northeastern New Jersey, the lower Hudson Valley, New York
City, and portions of northwestern Long Island and SW CT. There will
be little relief at night as temperatures are expected to be several
degrees above normal, in the lower and mid 70s.

.AVIATION /18Z TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low will linger over New England today. A weak
surface trough approaches tonight.

VFR today. MVFR tonight, borderline IFR, in spots. VFR tomorrow,
except in showers/thunderstorms.

Southerly wind speeds 10-20G20-30kt this afternoon/early
evening. The strongest gusts will be at KJFK/KLGA. S 10 kt
tonight. SW/SSW 10 kt tomorrow.

Low confidence in showers occurring late tonight/early tomorrow
morning. Scattered thunderstorms possible tomorrow
afternoon/evening.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

AMD possible for winds deviating from forecast. Start and end
time of gusts may be off by an hour or two.

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...

Wednesday: MVFR/IFR cigs in low stratus into Wednesday morning.
Chance low cigs continue into Wednesday afternoon.

Wednesday night and Thursday: VFR.

Friday-Sunday: Chance of MVFR or lower in afternoon/evening
showers/tstms.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A Small Craft Advisory remains in effect through 6AM Wednesday
morning. Winds and seas continue to increase today, with 20 to
25 kt gusts and 5 ft seas. Highest gusts are likely for the
western ocean zone, with 25 to 30 kt possible. This is due to
an enhanced low-level jet just east of NJ and into the NY Bight.
Seas build back to 5 ft tonight. SCA gusts expected for the
south shore bays during this time as well.

Marginal SCA ocean seas likely to continue into Wednesday in
persistent S flow with potential for occasional SCA gusts. Sub
SCA conditions likely return Thu into Fri with weak pressure
gradient.

An increasing and persistent south to southwest flow may allow for
ocean seas to build to SCA levels later Saturday into Sunday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
Multiple rounds of showers and thunderstorms are possible
late today into Wednesday and again this weekend. Low
predictability on specific hydrologic impacts this far out.
While widespread flood impacts are not expected, localized urban
and poor drainage flood impacts are possible.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
High risk of rip currents Tonight through Wednesday with 15 to 20 kt
southerly flow and 4-6ft@7 sec periods swells.
