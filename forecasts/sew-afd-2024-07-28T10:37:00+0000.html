Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
337 AM PDT Sun Jul 28 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low level onshore flow will weaken this morning. Northwesterly
flow aloft will push the upper level smoke into Eastern Washington.
Frontal system moving down the British Columbia coast will move
through the area Monday afternoon. Rain out ahead of the front
beginning later tonight along the coast, spreading inland Monday
morning. Upper level trough remaining over the area Monday night.
Upper level ridge will begin to build Tuesday with the ridge
strengthening midweek for a return to above normal temperatures.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
stratus along the coast through the Lower Chehalis Valley into the
Southwest Interior and Southern Puget Sound this morning. Some
high level clouds are also over the area along with some upper
level smoke (the moon is orange at last check). Temperatures at 3
am/10z were in the 50s and lower 60s.

Onshore flow weakening this morning but with the stratus already
into the interior the leading edge of the stratus will get into
the Central Puget Sound. The marine layer is not very deep and
will dissipate back to the coastline in the afternoon leaving
mostly sunny skies over the interior. Temperatures aloft not real
warm, 500 mb heights are in the mid 570 dms, keeping highs a
little below normal, 70s for the interior and mid and upper 60s
along the coast.

A very wet for the end of July front moving down the British
Columbia coast will be northwest of the area by early Monday
morning. Rain out ahead of the front arriving on the coast tonight
with a chance of rain inland in the early morning hours.
Increasing cloud cover will keep lows in the mid 50s to lower 60s.

Front reaching the coast midday Monday, moving through the
interior in the afternoon. Rain over the entire area Monday. Not
something said very often on July 29th. In general rainfall
amounts a quarter to a half inch in the lowlands which will be
enough to set records. A half inch to one inch of rain in the
mountains which will be welcome news for the folks fighting the
fires in the Northern Cascades. With the clouds and rain highs
only in the mid 60s. The forecast high of 66 for Seattle is the
normal high for May 11-15.

Front east of the area by Monday night with a trailing upper
level trough moving over Western Washington keeping showers in the
forecast. Onshore flow behind the front not very strong
minimizing the chances for a convergence zone. Lows in the mid
50s to lower 60s.

Upper level ridge beginning to build over Western Washington
Tuesday especially in the afternoon. Light low level onshore flow
combined with the moist lower layers of the air mass from the
rain will keep skies cloudy most of the day. Subsidence from the
ridge building could dry up some of the low level moisture in the
afternoon but for the most part Tuesday looking like a cloudy day.
Highs once again way below normal, mid 60s to lower 70s.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement with the upper level ridge continuing to build over
Western Washington Wednesday and Thursday. By Thursday afternoon
500 mb heights back in the lower 590 dms with the 500 mb heights
staying there for Friday and Saturday. Upper level ridge axis well
to the east and the low level flow never turns offshore. In the
interior highs in the mid 70s to lower 80s Wednesday warming to
the 80s and lower 90s for Friday and Saturday. Along the coast
highs in the mid 60s to lower 70s Wednesday warming into the 70s
for Thursday through Saturday. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow aloft continues over our region as
a upper trough digs southward from British Columbia. VFR at most
terminals early this morning except for KHQM, where marine stratus
has remained situated. Low marine stratus will spread inland
throughout the morning, with widespread MVFR conditions likely
in the interior. Locations that typically favor lower prone
ceilings such as KPWT, KOLM, and KHQM may see a mix of MVFR/IFR
conditions at times. Conditions look to improve to VFR by late
afternoon (19z-21z), but with a frontal system approaching the
area this evening into Monday, skies will likely not clear out
completely - with some mid/high level clouds moving in.

KSEA...VFR conditions early this morning will change as marine
stratus pushes through the terminal, resulting in MVFR ceilings as
soon as 10z-12z. Stratus will linger throughout most of the
morning before burning back by 19z-21z, with a return to VFR
conditions. Southwesterly winds 5 to 10 knots through majority of
the day.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure remains offshore with lower
pressure inland. Marine stratus will persist over the coastal
waters this morning and may restrict visibilities in most marine
zones. Small craft advisory will be allowed to expire this
morning through the Central and East Entrance of the Strait as
westerly winds decrease. A frontal system looks to pass over the
area waters through Monday, bringing showers to the area with no
wind concerns at this time, with generally benign winds over the
marine waters. Varying degrees of low level onshore flow can be
expected throughout the week.

Coastal seas 3 to 5 feet will persist throughout the rest of the
week.

.CLIMATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Here are the rainfall records for July 29th, Seattle
0.17 inches (1993), Olympia 0.12 inches (2008), Bellingham 0.40
inches (1955), Hoquiam 0.37 inches (2001) and Quillayute 1.24
inches (2008).

July 29th is the driest day on record at Seattle-Tacoma airport
with only 0.31 inches of rain (0.17 in 1993, 0.11 in 2008, 0.02 in
1955 and 0.01 in 1981) in 79 years. It is possible Seattle will
get more rain Monday than the combined other 79 years of record
at Seattle-Tacoma airport on July 29th.

Including the Federal Building records which go back to 1894 there
has been only one year, 1955, where Seattle got measurable rain on
both July 29th and July 30th. It is certainly possible the post
frontal showers could extend into the early morning hours Tuesday.

The average temperature in Seattle for the month of July through
the 27th is 70.4 degrees. This is the second warmest on record
surpassed only by 2015 with 70.6 degrees. With the cooler weather
Monday and Tuesday July 2024 will most likely drop to the 4th
warmest July on record at Seattle-Tacoma airport. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
