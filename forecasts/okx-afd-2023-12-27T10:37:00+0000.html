Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
537 AM EST Wed Dec 27 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure continues to weaken and depart to the east through
this afternoon. Low pressure over the Middle Atlantic this evening
tracks northward towards Long Island by Thursday morning. The
low then slowly moves to the east later Thursday. A series of
weak lows or surface troughs will linger over the region
Thursday night through Friday night. High pressure will then
start to build this weekend and into the first few days of the
new year.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Initial band of rain continues to inch closer early this
morning. Most of the echoes on the leading edge are not reaching
the ground. The rain will be encountering an unfavorable
environment as it works east with lingering surface ridging. The
expectation is that the rain will weaken and diminish in
coverage through the morning before becoming more widespread
again this afternoon and evening as the surface ridging weakens.

Dense fog remains a concern for mainly Long Island, Southern
Connecticut and Westchester counties early this morning. No
additional changes were made to the Advisory. An SPS remains for
the NYC metro, urban NE NJ corridor and portions of the Lower
Hudson Valley where some patchy dense fog is possible through 9
am.

Areas of fog may continue across Long Island and Southern
Connecticut as the surface ridging holds in place. There could
be some areas of dense fog into the afternoon, but confidence is
not high enough to extend any portion of the advisory at this
time.

Warm advection will continue to increase through the day as a
frontal system approaches. Low pressure will also begin developing
over the Middle Atlantic late in the day and in the evening. These
features will help break down the lingering ridging. Any rain
that occurs before this evening will be light and only amount
to a tenth or so at most and this would largely be west of the
NYC metro.

Highs today will be above normal in the upper 40s to lower 50s,
warmest near the coast.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure along the Middle Atlantic coast will track northward
towards Long Island by Thursday morning and then shift towards
Cape Cod this evening. The low then slowly moves offshore, but
will leave behind several weaker lows or surface troughs through
Friday night.

     Key Messages...

*Rain will become widespread this evening and continue into early
 Thursday morning. The bulk of the rain should be pushing east
 of the NYC metro by day break Thursday with rain ongoing across
 Long Island and southeast Connecticut. Coverage of rain
 diminishes further into the afternoon.

*The rain will become moderate to locally heavy at times. Max
 rainfall rates of around 0.50 in/hr are possible. Higher
 probabilities for heavier rain exist across NE NJ, NYC metro,
 and Long Island.

*Total rainfall amounts from this morning through Thursday
 morning range from around an inch across the Lower Hudson
 Valley and interior southern Connecticut to around 1.5 inches
 across NE NJ, NYC metro, and Long Island. Locally higher
 amounts around 2 inches are possible.

*Minor urban and poor drainage flooding is the main threat. A
 few flashier rivers and streams in NE NJ could approach minor
 flooding benchmarks.

There has been a growing signal in the guidance over the last
24 hours for a period of enhanced lift in the form of a coupled
jet structure and middle level frontogenesis. There will also
likely be enhanced moisture convergence along and north of the
track of the low pressure. The axis of the enhanced lift will
initially occur from the NYC metro on west the first half of the
night and then shift to the east across Long Island and
southern Connecticut towards the early morning hours. The low
should track south of Long Island Thursday morning with the axis
of moisture and lift shifting away from the region in the
afternoon.

HREF probabilities for seeing greater than 2 inches in a 6 hour
period tonight are low and under 5 percent. HREF probabilities
for seeing greater than 1 inch in a 6 hour period tonight are
about 50- 60 percent from around the NYC metro/urban NE NJ on
east into Long Island. Recent heavy rainfall brings a concern
for flooding along rivers and streams. Based on the latest
headwater guidance generally more than 2 inches is needed in 6
hours for minor flood stages to be reached on some of the main
stem rivers. 2 inches of rain in 6 hours seems like a worst case
scenario with this system. Have held off on a flood watch based
on collaboration with PHI. Any river flooding would more than
likely occur later on Thursday after the heaviest rain. Will let
the day shift reassess the latest guidance to see if a flood
watch will be needed for our NE NJ counties.

The main low will continue tracking east Thursday afternoon
and night. The main closed low will still be well to our west
near the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. The closed low will then
shift towards the southeast Friday into Friday night. There will
likely be several spokes of energy aloft that could interact
with lingering lower pressure/surface troughs over the area for
periods of light rain at times. The modeling has not been
consistent on what time period this would be most likely. Have
elected to cap PoPs off at high chance late Thursday into Friday
night. It will not be a wash out, but periods of light rain are
possible at any time. Otherwise, mostly cloudy to overcast
conditions are likely to continue.

Temperatures will remain above normal Thursday and Friday with
highs in the upper 40s to low 50s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
No significant changes made to the long term and stuck close to
the NBM for this update.

*Key Points*

* Rain chances now look to continue into Saturday, before drying out
  on Sunday into New Year`s Day.

* A slight cooldown to more seasonable temperatures Saturday through
  Tuesday.

Midlevel trough shears out as it heads east on Saturday morning
with the trough axis passing through the area by late in the
day. Attendant surface low heads to the northeast with moisture
wrapped around its western periphery, as surface ridging
approaches from the west. Have kept chance rain in for Saturday
morning through midday as the low slowly pulls away. Thermal
profiles suggest all rain on the backside of the system. Any
lingering precip will end from west to east by Saturday
afternoon.

Thereafter, mainly dry conditions look to prevail Sunday through
Tuesday. Weak upper ridging becomes more zonal by early next week.
A mid level trough ejects out of the Central Plains by late
Monday into Tuesday--there is some timing differences among the
global models on this. Nonetheless, guidance shows a surface low
developing out ahead of this across the Mid Atlantic by
Tuesday. At this time, the area remains on the north side of its
precip shield as the system remains south of the region.

.AVIATION /10Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>While vsbys have improved over for NYC terminals on west, LIFR
cigs continue at all terminals except KSWF which is MVFR. Expect
the low conditions to continue through the morning push and
into at least the mid morning hours today. There may be a brief
period of IFR/MVFR this afternoon for a few hours, but
confidence is low in this. Regardless, conditions then fall
back to IFR or lower Wednesday night in rain, possibly heavy at
times after 03Z. Rain tapers on Thursday morning, but IFR or
lower conditions remain.

Winds will be ENE, under 10 kts. Winds do become more easterly
around 6-8kt later in the TAF period.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Uncertainty on how much improvement occurs Wednesday afternoon.
Possibly conditions remain IFR but could also improve to MVFR.
Confidence on any timing of any improvement remains low.

OUTLOOK FOR 06Z THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...

Wednesday night: Rain with IFR and pockets of LIFR conditions.

Thursday: MVFR possible with chance of showers. E winds G20kt
possible in the morning at the CT/Long Island terminals.

Friday: MVFR possible with chance of showers. N / NE winds.

Saturday: Mainly VFR. NW winds G20-25kt.

Sunday: VFR.

.MARINE...
Marine dense fog advisory remains in effect for all waters
through 11 am.

Conditions will remain below SCA levels through this evening.
E-SE winds increase tonight ahead of approaching low pressure.
Think winds will stay below SCA levels though as the low is
weak. The low passes near the waters Thursday morning and then
east Thursday afternoon leaving behind a weak pressure gradient
into Friday night. Ocean seas will build tonight into Thursday
with potential to see 5 ft seas late Thursday into Friday. Seas
should begin subsiding Friday afternoon into Friday night.

Marginal SCA conditions are expected on the ocean waters Saturday
morning. SCA conditions then become likely over the eastern ocean
zones with developing low pressure to the south late Saturday into
Sunday, with 5-7ft seas. Sub SCA conditions return by late
Sunday.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
Storm total rainfall 1.0-1.5 inches is likely, mainly from this
evening through Thursday morning. Locally higher amounts are
possible around 2 inches. Due to recent heavy rainfall, minor
flooding along a few quick responding rivers in NE NJ is possible.
Otherwise, minor urban and poor drainage flooding should be the
main hydrologic impact.

There are no hydrologic impacts expected Thursday night through
early next week.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Minor coastal flooding now looks more likely on Thursday
morning with possible impacts for vulnerable coastal
communities. This is associated with a passing low pressure
system with onshore flow and an astronomically high tide. A
coastal flood advisory is now in effect for the the south shore
of Nassau and Queens, with tidal departures of between 1.3 and
1.8ft. High tide peaks from about 7-10am Thursday morning.
Statements are in effect for parts of Queens and southwestern
Suffolk, where minor benchmarks are not expected to be reached,
but some inundation (less than 0.5ft) is possible during high
tide.

Elsewhere, coastal flood statements have been issued for
the SW CT coastline on the Western Sound. Tidal departures of
1.25-1.50 ft are needed for minor flooding, which are expected
to be reached during Thursday afternoon`s high tide between
about noon and 4pm. Localized minor flooding is possible in
these areas.

The threat for dune erosion appears to be low and isolated with
this event.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
