Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
800 PM PDT Tue Oct 1 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A weak front will cross the region this evening,
bringing some light rain as it slides eastward. Cooler conditions
linger through Wednesday as the trailing upper trough shifts
through. A stronger system follows Friday to bring more widespread
rain across the region.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No significant changes made
to the forecast this evening. Updated aviation and marine sections
can be found below:

A weak frontal band has moved through the region this evening,
with relatively light rain amounts across the area. The bigger
sensible impact will be the cooler temperatures that remain into
Wednesday as the upper trough slides through. Expect clouds to
linger and maybe some light rain in the far north. Weak high
pressure builds on Thursday will could bring some morning fog in
the river valleys and other sheltered location. Otherwise,
temperatures hold near or slightly below normal during the day and
morning lows dip into the lower 40s or upper 30s.

Expect a shift in the pattern as ensemble guidance suggests the
ridge over the western U.S. will begin to shift a little eastward,
opening the door to the arrival of the next frontal system. This
will likely bring more widespread rain chances with up to a half
inch or so expected in the coast and into the mountains. Not a
hydrologically significant system at this point in the season by
any stretch, but still a good bit of rain. Temperatures will again
cool a bit as this system passes with daytime highs in the upper
50s to around 60.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Ensemble guidance
continues to support some weak ridging building across the Pacific
Northwest into the weekend, bringing a drier trend for most.
However, there is a cluster of ensemble solutions that suggest a
weak trough could maintain at least some light rain chances. This
would be especially the case in the mountains and along the far
northwest portions of the area. Otherwise, still no significant
signal for a notable weather event during the early start of next
week with increasing spread in the pattern by Monday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Flow aloft will continue to remain westerly with
northerly offshore low level flow. Variable surface flow and
generally VFR cigs are present across western Washington, the
exceptions being in the northern Sound area and along the coast
where MVFR to IFR cigs persist. Expect flow around 10Z to become
easterly, turning back to the southwest by midday on Wednesday.

KSEA...Variable to northerly winds 6-9 kts as the weak front
transits this evening, becoming northeast and easing to 4-6 kts.
Conditions should remain VFR overnight into Wednesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Seas remain the main issue - building to 9 to
14 feet beginning in the northern outer coastal waters and
spreading to all zones Tuesday evening through all of Wednesday
night/Thursday morning. Onshore flow will pick up behind the front,
with gusty winds reaching the central/east Strait of Juan de Fuca
late Tuesday night/Wednesday morning with small craft
advisories for the seas/winds.

The flow will become more northerly Thursday with riding building in
southern British Columbia. Another disturbance is possible Friday
but predictability of hazards are too low at this time. Seas will
drop gradually down to 4 to 6 feet Thursday/Friday, building back to
5 to 7 feet towards the end of the week.
