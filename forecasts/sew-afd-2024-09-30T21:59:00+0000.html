Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridging continues to build into our area
this afternoon for sunny skies and above normal temperatures. A
series of weak dissipating fronts will move into the region late
Tuesday into Wednesday for light showers and increased cloudiness.
Upper level ridging rebounds into Thursday for drier conditions
before another system moves in Friday into Saturday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Current satellite imagery
shows some high clouds moving through mainly near Vancouver Island
and the northern portions of the state. Elsewhere, mostly clear
skies remain with plentiful sunshine across the state as upper
level ridging builds through the region. Temperatures this
afternoon will climb in the low to mid 60s, with overnight lows in
the mid to upper 40s.

The aforementioned upper level ridging will start to shift
eastward and flatten into Tuesday, as an upper level low will
start to move southeastward and push a front through western
Washington. This front looks particularly weak and will likely
start to fall apart as it attempts to move through the area by the
morning. At this time, it looks like any precipitation will
likely be limited to the northern portions of the state, and the
higher elevations of the Olympic and Cascades. Temperatures will
warm into the mid 60s, and could see highs in the South Sound
nudge up to near 70. Lingering clouds and showers may be possible
into Wednesday, but we will see generally conditions improving
with less cloud cover in the afternoon. High temperatures on
Wednesday will stay in the lower to mid 60s.

Upper level ridging looks to rebound into Thursday, where
temperatures will warm into the mid and upper 60s and with partly
cloudy skies.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Ensemble guidance is once
again lowering confidence in the long term forecast, especially
over the weekend. Latest GFS ensemble depicts a front moving
through late Friday into Saturday, while the ECMWF brings the
front a little bit earlier, arriving more on Friday morning. The
ECMWF solution shows this system being more wetter than the GFS,
with ensembles showing precipitation for most of the area on
Friday. Overall, expecting some form of precipitation Friday into
Saturday, but still awaiting for the deterministic runs and
ensembles to agree with each other. It does seem likely that we
will end the weekend on a dry note, with upper level ridging
returning for drier conditions.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft with northerly offshore low level
flow. VFR conditions across Western Washington today with patchy
morning fog possible again into Tuesday morning, though increasing
high level clouds may help to limit to very patchy coverage across
the Southwest Interior, south Puget Sound, and outlying river
valleys. Showers are possible Tuesday afternoon with weak system,
little or no impact with VFR ceilings expected through the
afternoon.

KSEA...VFR today. Increasing mid and high level clouds Tuesday with
VFR ceilings. Showers possible Tuesday afternoon with no impact

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak offshore low level flow tonight into Tuesday morning
will become onshore Tuesday afternoon as a weak front dissipates
over the coastal waters. Hazardous double digit seas are expected to
reach the coastal waters later Tuesday into Wednesday. Small craft
advisories for hazardous seas have been issued for the coastal
waters Tuesday afternoon through Wednesday night. In addition low-
end small craft advisory winds are expected in the Central Strait
late Tuesday night into early Wednesday.  Some degree of onshore
flow continues Wednesday before the overall low level flow turns
northerly once again on Thursday as another surface ridge builds
into southern British Columbia.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
