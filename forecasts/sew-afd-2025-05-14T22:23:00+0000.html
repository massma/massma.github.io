Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
323 PM PDT Wed May 14 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Transient ridging will build tonight into the first
half of Thursday. However, the next disturbance will quickly
follow as a round of rain arrives by Thursday evening. An
unsettled weather pattern will remain in place across the Pacific
Northwest this weekend through early next week, maintaining
widespread clouds and rain showers.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Broad troughing
resides over the Intermountain West as a ridge noses into British
Columbia. For tonight, the aforementioned ridge will settle over
the PNW as its axis cuts across western Washington by early
Thursday morning. As a result, weak convergence and showers will
gradually subside overnight through aid of subsidence aloft and
weakening onshore flow. Minimum temperatures are to bottom out
into the lower to upper 40s.

As alluded to, Thursday will get off to a dry start but high
clouds are slated to increase ahead of the next system. A frontal
boundary is arriving by the evening with widespread rainfall and
mountain snow above 4,500-5,000 ft. This feature will open up the
pattern as upper-lows bring successive rounds of showers keeping
conditions cloudy and drippy throughout the weekend. Highs are to
remain in the upper 50s to lower 60s, 5 degrees or so below
average for mid- May.


.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Upper-troughing will get
escorted out by another round of transient ridging Sunday night-
Monday morning. Ensembles have mostly zonal flow aloft following
thereafter before the next disturbance potentially arrives around
Wednesday. Temperatures won`t stray too far from average.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest flow aloft continues across Western
Washington as an upper level trough shifts eastward across British
Columbia. The flow aloft will turn westerly on Thursday as a
weakening front approaches the region. Low level onshore flow will
ease overnight. VFR ceilings and a few pockets of MVFR will lower
back to predominantly MVFR near or after 09Z and persist into
Thursday morning. Precipitation with an incoming front will reach
coastal areas midday Thursday then spread to the interior
terminals by early Thursday evening.

KSEA...VFR ceilings will fall back to 020-030 overnight tonight.
Surface winds W/SW 5-7 knots this afternoon may become light and
variable for a period around 00Z before returning to a southerly
direction overnight tonight.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure over the coastal and offshore waters
will weaken late Thursday as a frontal system approaches the area.
The front will weaken as it moves onshore on Friday. Surface
ridging will rebuild offshore on Saturday then shift into the
coastal waters early next week.

Seas will generally remain under 10 feet through the weekend, but
may approach 10 feet early next week as a swell train generated by a
trough over the northern Gulf of Alaska arrives.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

start of the next rainy season; it will only be included as needed.
