Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
409 PM PST Wed Mar 5 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cool and relatively dry conditions are expected
across much of western Washington through this weekend. The
exception will be across far northwestern Washington as a system
glaces the area. A cool and wet weather pattern may return early
next week bringing lowland rain, snow, and increased winds back
to the mountains.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Quiet conditions across
the region this afternoon. A few weak echoes are present on radar
but little impact is currently expected. High pressure is expected
to gradually slide over the region Thursday and Friday resulting
in dry and cool conditions. Overnight lows will cool down into the
30s the next couple of nights with areas of freezing temperatures
possible in more rural locations. Patchy fog is also possible as
is an isolated threat of black ice.

By Saturday, the ridge axis will move overhead and slightly warmer
and wetter air will push into the region. Weak atmospheric river
activity will be directed north along the BC coast and could graze
the northwestern corner of Washington.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...By Sunday the
aforementioned AR is likely to still be directed at the BC coast,
keeping precipitation in the forecast for northwest WA while
mainly dry conditions persist elsewhere. As the AR weakens Monday,
a it will likely push east across the state providing for some
light precipitation. A brief break is possible late Monday into
Tuesday before ensemble guidance begins to favor longwave
troughing across the west from Tuesday through much of next week.
This will bring with it an increased risk of heavy rain and
mountain snow as well as gusty winds.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Widespread VFR ceilings across Western Washington this
afternoon. IFR/LIFR conditions are possible tonight into Thursday
morning for low stratus/patchy fog along Puget Sound and southwest
interior terminals. Conditions expected to gradually improve after
17-19Z Thursday and rebound to VFR. North/northeasterly flow
expected to persist through the remainder of the TAF period. Wind
speeds will ease slightly overnight before they increase along
Puget Sound and coastal terminals Thursday morning into the
afternoon hours, with speeds of 6-10 kt. As for the other
terminals, speeds will be around 2-5 kt.

KSEA...VFR conditions expected to persist into Wednesday night.
IFR/LIFR ceilings possible early Thursday morning due to a low
stratus deck. There is some uncertainty among the models in
resolving the low stratus deck. However, high-resolution guidance
shows a 70-80% chance of seeing ceilings below 2000 ft, and
40-60% of seeing ceilings below 1000 ft. Improvement into VFR is
expected in the late morning. Northeasterly winds will ease
slightly overnight and will increase Thursday morning into the
early afternoon, with speeds of 8-10 kt. Winds will gradually
subside late Thursday afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A SCA remains in effect for high seas through Thursday
evening. High pressure will keep building over the area tonight into
Thursday, bringing calmer marine conditions through Friday night.
High pressure will begin to weaken on Friday; a frontal system will
move over the waters late Friday night into the weekend, bringing
small craft winds to the coastal waters, Strait of Juan de Fuca, and
Northern Interior waters. Seas expected to remain below 10 ft
through Friday night and will build to 10-13 ft by Saturday night.
An active weather pattern is favored into next week.
