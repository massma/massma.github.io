Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
352 PM PDT Fri Jul 19 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Warm and dry conditions will persist into the weekend
as upper level ridging amplifies over the region on Saturday. A
shortwave will skirt the area on Sunday and may bring some light
showers to portions of western Washington. An upper level trough
moving into British Columbia early next week will cool temperatures
closer to seasonal norms.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery this
afternoon shows mostly clear skies across the interior, with
stratus scattering across the coastal waters. Temperatures this
afternoon are generally trending in the 70s to lower 80s across
the interior and in the 60s and 70s along the coast. Expect highs
across the interior to warm a few more degrees and top out in the
upper 70s to mid 80s.

Upper level ridging will amplify over the region on Saturday with
500 mb heights building into the 590 dms. Flow aloft will transition
to southerly and temperatures aloft will warm to 20C. Onshore flow
will weaken and expect a shallower marine layer to allow for
afternoon temperatures on Saturday to reach the upper 80s and low
90s across the interior. High temperatures near the coast will be
in the 70s.

The upper level ridge will slowly shift east Saturday night into
Sunday as an upper level trough approaches the area. Another upper
level shortwave looks to precede the trough and may bring some
light precipitation to the coast on Sunday. Latest high-res guidance
indicates roughly a 10-15% chance of isolated thunderstorms across
the mountains Sunday afternoon, so will need to keep an eye on
this trend over the next day. Temperatures on Sunday will cool a
few degrees along the coast, and generally look to top out in the
60s. Temperatures across the interior, however, look to remain
warm, generally climbing into the mid to upper 80s.

Guidance remains in good agreement with a pattern shift starting
Monday as a broad upper level trough starts to move into the
region. Increased onshore flow will allow for temperatures to
cool back down towards seasonal norms, with highs generally
expected to be in the 60s along the coast and 70s across the
interior.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The aforementioned trough
will remain over the region through the long term period. This
will promote onshore flow, morning stratus, and temperatures close
to seasonal norms. Highs generally look to trend in the 60s for
the coast and 70s across the interior, with overnight lows
trending in the upper 40s to mid 50s. Not much expected in the
way of precipitation at this time, though could see a few very
spotty showers at times across the mountains late in the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft with troughing upstream and ridging
downstream. The low level flow is weakly onshore. VFR across the
area with clear skies. LIFR/IFR stratus will rebound along the coast
tonight and possibly making it`s way to KSHN-KPWT. Any lingering
stratus should return to the coast by 18z Saturday with widespread
VFR in the cards.

KSEA...VFR for the remainder of the day and into Saturday. Marine
stratus will push inland again overnight but should mostly remain
west of Puget Sound. Surface winds out of the northwest this
afternoon then northerly by late this evening before shifting back
to the northwest Saturday afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure offshore with lower pressure inland.
Because of this, we`ll see prevailing onshore flow of varying
strength. A SCA has been issued this evening into tonight with more
headlines likely into next week. Gales are possible Sunday evening
into Monday. Seas 3 to 5 ft into Saturday before rising to 4 to 7 ft
Saturday night through Monday.

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Warm and dry conditions through Sunday. Afternoon
minimum RHs again dipping close to critical thresholds today and
Saturday for the lowlands and through Sunday for the Cascades.
Instability may increase enough to keep a mention of elevated
concern for the Cascades especially Saturday afternoon and evening.
Another disturbance may bring a renewed threat for thunderstorms
Sunday across some portion of the mountains, with high resolution
ensembles including the NBM showing a 10-15% chance at this time.
A cooler more humid pattern develops Monday as the pattern switches
to be dominated by an upper level trough over the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
