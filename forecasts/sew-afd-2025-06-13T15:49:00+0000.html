Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
849 AM PDT Fri Jun 13 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Upper level trough remaining offshore through the
period. A weak system will spin out of the trough into Western
Washington later Tuesday or Wednesday. Varying degrees of low
level onshore flow through the middle of next week.

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Couple pockets of drizzle currently present on radar in
the north sound (from Mountlake Terrace to Mount Vernon) - will
dissipate next few hours. A few areas may receive some clearing
into the afternoon (Skokomish to Olympia to Chehalis, and areas
along and north of the Strait of Juan de Fuca), but otherwise will
see good cloud coverage elsewhere in the afternoon. Aviation
section has been updated, otherwise no major changes to the
forecast.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
stratus has filled in over most of the area early this morning.
The Northwest Interior and the San Juan Islands are the most
notable areas with some clear skies. It`s a little cool out there
at 2 am/09z with temperatures in the mid 40s to lower 50s.

Stratus will continue to fill in through a couple of hours after
sunrise making for a cloudy morning. Weak convergence over
Snohomish county could produce a little drizzle or a light
shower. Could also see a light shower in the North and Central
Cascades. Onshore flow weakening this afternoon. This combined
with the strong mid June sun will dissipate the stratus by mid
afternoon leaving mostly sunny skies. Cloud cover most of the day
and a slightly cooler than normal air mass over the area will keep
highs in the 60s.

Not much going on tonight into Saturday. Upper level trough
remaining offshore with southwesterly flow aloft. Nothing embedded
in the flow aloft. Low level flow onshore flow increasing
overnight with stratus filling back in over most of the area by
sunrise. Low level onshore flow weakening later in the day with
the stratus dissipating in the afternoon for another round of late
day sunshine. Lows tonight in the 40s and lower 50s. Highs
Saturday in the 60s and lower 70s.

Slight change in the pattern Saturday night and Sunday with the
upper level trough offshore digging south. 500 mb heights
increasing slightly over the area. Surface gradients going flat
resulting in less morning cloud cover than today and Saturday.
More sunshine and slightly warmer temperatures aloft combining to
warm highs into the mid 60s to mid 70s. With less cloud cover
overnight lows Sunday morning in the 40s. Some of the cooler
locations could drop into the upper 30s.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Confidence not real high
in the extended forecast. Models have been having trouble coming
up with a consistent solution for the first half of next week.
There is general agreement that a large upper trough over the
Eastern Pacific will remain in place through the period. Model
inconsistency coming in to play with the finer details of when
weak shortwaves spinning out of the trough will move through
Western Washington. 00z operational runs and the ensembles going
for the best chances for showers in the Tuesday night and
Wednesday time frame. A few runs ago the strongest shortwave was
forecast to move through Monday. Will not be surprised if the best
chance for showers gets pushed later in the week with future
runs.

Southwesterly flow aloft continuing Monday along with weaker
onshore flow for highs in the mid 60s to mid 70s. Upper level flow
weakening and cooling a little for the remainder of the period.
A little stronger low level onshore flow and more cloud cover will
drop highs to a little below normal for Tuesday through Thursday,
in the 60s and lower 70s.

It has been an unusually dry start to June for Western Washington.
Seattle has not gotten any measurable rain the first 12 days of
the month. In 81 years of records at Seattle-Tacoma airport this
is only the 7th year this has happened. The last time was in 2009.
The first half of June has been completely dry in Seattle only 4
times in the last 80 years ( 2009, 1996, 1982 and 1969 ). The
longest dry streak for Seattle in the month of June is 25 days,
June 1 to 25, 1982. It then rained 4 out of the last 5 days in
June 1982. The driest June on record is 0.13 inches in 1951.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Extensive cloud cover this morning is bringing lowered
ceilings to Western Washington terminals, primarily MVFR ceilings.
Clouds will begin to scatter first along the interior and then along
the coast around 19z-21z. Area-wide VFR conditions expected to
persist into the afternoon/evening. Stratus does look to potentially
redevelop again early Saturday morning, first along the coast after
around 06z-12z Sat, then through the interior later after the end of
the TAF period. W to SW 7-12 kt will persist through the TAF period,
with the exception of KPAE, where winds will switch to N this
evening following a push down the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

KSEA...MVFR conditions with the stratus over the terminal this
morning. Models have clouds scattering rapidly this morning for a
breakout time of around 19z-20z. VFR conditions  persist into the
afternoon/evening hours. There is a 25-30% chance of stratus
reforming and producing MVFR ceilings between 12-17z Saturday. Winds
remain SW 5-8 kt through the TAF period.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The overall weather pattern will remain consistent Friday
and into this weekend--broad high pressure will slowly drift
southward, maintaining northwesterly winds across the coastal
waters. Breezy winds with gusts up to 25 kt are possible at times
today. These winds are also creating steep seas, with seas 7 to 8 ft
with a dominant period of around 8 seconds.

A weakening front will move through the waters on Monday, with a
more active pattern expected next week with several systems
traversing the area waters through the middle of next week.

Elsewhere, expect diurnally driven pushes of westerly winds down the
Strait of Juan de Fuca each evening. The push tonight looks to
remain below 20 kt, therefore have held off on issuing a Small Craft
Advisory for this evening. The push Saturday evening looks stronger
and will likely require another Small Craft Advisory then. Trends
will be evaluated to determine the need for any additional
advisories on subsequent days.
