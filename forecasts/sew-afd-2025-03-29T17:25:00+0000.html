Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weakening low pressure over the area today will allow
showers to gradually diminish through tonight. Temporary weak high
pressure will provide drier and mild conditions on Sunday before
another trough arrives early in the coming week with additional
chances for showers and a return to cooler conditions. Drier and
somewhat warmer conditions are expected to return at the end of
next week as high pressure rebuilds into Western Washington.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...An upper level trough
continues to weaken early this morning as it lifts northward into
the British Columbia coast. Shower coverage has noticeably
diminished over the past few hours with most activity along the
coast and over the Olympic Peninsula. Shower chances will linger
across Western Washington today, then we`ll see drier conditions
develop tonight as a weak upper ridge builds into area and the low
level flow turns weakly offshore. Sunday will be a dry and
noticeably mild day for much of the area, but showers associated
the next upper trough offshore will start to spread into coastal
areas and the Southwest Interior by the evening hours. This
activity will lift northward across the area Sunday night into
Monday for cool, showery conditions.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The upper level trough will
continue to wobble offshore into Tuesday as a series of upper
disturbances rotating around it spread showers across the area
and hold temperatures slightly below seasonal norms. Broad upper
troughing remains over the area into the middle of the coming
week for continuing shower chances and slightly below normal
temperatures. Looking beyond that, models continue to exhibit
noteworthy differences. While the ensembles generally agree with
broad upper troughing over the interior Western U.S. moving into
the second half of the coming week, they continue to disagree with
what happens upstream over the Gulf of Alaska and the Pacific
Northwest.

In general, the Euro members favor a more amplified pattern with
a sharp upper trough dropping southward over the region Thursday
followed by a high amplitude ridge folding into the area toward
the end of the week. GFS members lean toward a weak trough on
Thursday followed by weak upper ridging toward Friday. Much of
this detail gets washed out in the forecast which uses the NBM
50th percentile, but the trends still point toward a decreasing
chance of showers by the end of the week and temperatures
rebounding to near normal. And next weekend? It could prove to be
a pleasant one if ensemble trends hold up. 27

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft will become more light westerly
this morning before shifting southwest again by tonight. Current
conditions are mostly MVFR within shower activity and VFR outside
of shower activity. Showers will continue through the day, however
expect a rebounding trend in ceilings towards more widespread VFR
by the afternoon. Brief ridging will allow drier conditions
tonight, but residual surface moisture will likely lead to patchy
fog development overnight into early Sunday. Breezy S-SW surface
winds (5-10 kt) will switch to more northerly after 00z Sunday
but will remain generally light in magnitude.

KSEA...MVFR conditions this morning with ceilings near 2500 ft
and shower activity in the vicinity of the terminal. Cigs look
rebound back to VFR between 18-20z. Southwesterly winds will
persist at 5 to 10 kt before shifting out of the north tonight.
Conditions look to remain VFR heading into Sunday morning.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light southerly winds will persist today as high
pressure starts to build into the area. Winds will transition more
east to northeast by Sunday morning as a brief period of
generally benign conditions continues. The next weather system
will bring increased southerly winds to the area waters Sunday
night into Monday. An additional disturbance may move into the
area near midweek but uncertainty exists at this time.

Seas generally hovering at 7 to 9 ft around 10 to 11 seconds this
morning will continue to gradually subside today. Seas of 4 to 6
feet expected on Sunday before seas build to near 7 to 9 feet into
Tuesday.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Lingering showers continue, but additional
precipitation amounts will not be hydrologically significant.
Lingering flooding on the Skokomish River comes to an end today as
the river recedes. Uncertainty remains in the QPF next week, but
with the river running high, additional flooding cannot be ruled
out on the Skokomish River.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
