Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
825 PM PDT Tue Aug 27 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will start to build over western
Washington, leading to a warming and drying trend into the weekend.
Daytime highs will remain mild Wednesday but will ramp up quickly to
above normal temperatures Thursday and into the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Earlier convergence zone
activity has wound down and as such, current radar is generally
clear. Satellite imagery shows some flat cumulus scattered here and
there with plenty of peeks of blue sky. High pressure still slated
to start building into the area Wednesday with relatively mild
daytime highs expected to be a few degrees below normal. Mother
nature apparently does not do transition material, and highs
Thursday will already be above normal with that trend continuing
into the weekend.

Inherited forecast remains on track and as such, no evening update
is needed. For additional forecast details, please refer to the
Previous Discussion section below.

From Previous Discussion...Recent radar imagery shows convergence
zone activity still continuing mainly around the King/Snohomish
county line, with showers in and around the zone. Thunderstorm
activity have been observed this afternoon around the Puget Sound
Convergence Zone, with a few bouts of lightning here and there. PSCZ
activity will continue to steer southward towards Pierce county into
this evening, with again chances of showers and possibility a
lightning strike or two. Again, most of the precipitation will be
mainly in the Cascades, but cannot rule out a couple of potential
showers near the zone this evening. With any thunderstorm that
develops, lightning, small hail, and brief heavy downpours are the
primary hazards. Shower activity will decrease throughout the
remainder of the evening, along with any thunderstorm threat. High
temperatures this afternoon will top out in the mid to upper 60s
across the interior, and lower 60s along the coastal regions.

Conditions will begin to dry out tonight as a high pressure begins
to build offshore with higher upper level heights. With residual
surface moisture and mostly clear skies by tonight, can likely see
some patchy fog across the region early Wednesday morning.

Warmer and drier conditions will prevail throughout the short
term as upper level ridging continues over western Washington.
Temperatures will warm into the low 70s by Wednesday, and into the
upper 70s and lower 80s Thursday and Friday. What a way to end
August!

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...From Previous
Discussion...Ensemble guidance continues to highlight the
aforementioned upper level ridge starting to break down by Sunday,
with a weak trough sliding northward near our region by the
beginning of next week. There is some uncertainty regarding the
exact placement and intensity of this feature, which may result in
differences in temperatures and precipitation chances. As of now,
confidence is low in any particular detail, but will continue to
monitor the trends.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Flow aloft remains north to northwesterly as an exiting
upper level trough is slowly replaced by upper level ridging.
Activity has quieted over W WA, although some lingering mid-level
clouds are in place. Widespread VFR conditions in place and will
remain that way for most terminals. Those along the coast and those
that tend to favor lower cigs will see some low clouds move in
overnight resulting in MVFR conditions. These terminals will rebound
to VFR conditions by early afternoon.

KSEA...VFR conditions and generally northeasterly surface winds 8-12
kts. Light southeast winds return by 12z tonight with some scattered
low clouds but likely VFR conditions remaining. Cullen/18<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow continues in the wake of the now departed
cold front. Winds have eased over the coastal waters, but seas
remain steep (especially beyond about 20 nm from shore), so the
Small Craft Advisory will remain in place for the outer coastal
waters through 11 PM. Meanwhile, west winds through the Strait of
Juan de Fuca have eased as onshore flow continues to relax tonight
into Wednesday as broad surface ridging rebuilds over the offshore
and coastal waters. Thermally induced low pressure will then expand
northward along the Oregon and Washington coast Thursday through
Saturday, turning the flow northerly. Winds are expected to remain
generally under advisory levels across area waters with the
exception of perhaps the southern outer coastal waters. Cullen/18<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
