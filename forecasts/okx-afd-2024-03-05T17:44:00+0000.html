Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...
Low pressure moves through today, followed by another low pressure
system Wednesday afternoon into Thursday. High pressure then
briefly builds in during Friday ahead of another storm system
next weekend. High pressure slowly builds back in on Monday and
Tuesday.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING/...
Low pres was analyzed near Cape May at 11 am. The low will
gradually pass thru the fcst area today. The best frogen is now
N of the cwa, with the best dynamics W. As a result, will
expect mainly light rain and dz into this eve, and ending by
midnight as the low tracks nwd thru New England.

Late tngt, the lower levels will dry out with the winds
shifting to the south, then southwest. The southwest flow ushers
in somewhat drier air in the boundary layer. With a lack of
separation with temps and dew points look for perhaps some
patchy fog in some spots with a wet ground and lighter winds.
Min temps will stay a good 10 degrees or so above normal.

Temperatures will average a few degrees above normal today
despite the cloud cover and onshore flow with temperatures
reaching the upper 40s and lower 50s.

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING THROUGH THURSDAY/...
For Wednesday the pacific branch lifts north of the area allowing
for the a closed mid level low to swing up from the SE state for the
afternoon and into Wed night. Much of the morning looks to be dry,
with the next slug of higher PWATs / moisture pushing up from the
south for the afternoon and evening. The HREF has many of its
members bringing pockets of moderate to locally heavy rain very late
in the day. Global guidance however has had some uncertainty with
it, especially with respect to how far west the axis of higher mean
specific humidity and PWATs ultimately gets.  The ECMWF and NAEFS
Situational Awareness Tables (ESATs) have 3 to 4 standardized
anomalies with respect to the lower latitude moisture plume moving
into the area. This is based on the climatology for the time of
year, and March is not typically a favored time of year for
impactful heavy rain. The warm cloud layer and the instability is
doesn`t appear to be quite there to drive high hourly rainfall
rates, thus any potential for rainfall flooding impacts would be
driven more by duration with respect to more moderate rainfall
rates. However, antecedent conditions remains rather saturated from
previous rainfall, with antecedent conditions only worsening / more
saturated going forward in time with each subsequent rain event.
This is what is really driving the marginal to slight risk from WPC
across our area. WPC maintains the slight risk of excessive rainfall
for most of the eastern half of the area Wed afternoon through Wed
night. With respect to the global guidance, the thermal forcing
appears to be further east over the less flood prone areas,
therefore the confidence is still not quite there at the moment to
hoist flood watches. The HREF appears more bullish on this
potential, and would like to see another run before initiating flood
watches. Temperatures will run well above normal Wednesday with
mainly 50s region wide. With any heavier rainfall across eastern
sections cannot rule out a rumble of thunder or two late Wed and
Wednesday night.

The lower level jet and better mid level forcing gets further east
and north into Thursday. Look for a purely stratiform rain with the
winds having more of a northerly component. Rainfall on Thursday
will be on the lighter side, and there is the chance that rain may
completely shut off closer to mid day. Have gone with consensus PoPs
on Thursday with some likely PoPs further east earlier on, with
mainly chance PoPs for the afternoon. Temperatures will continue to
average above normal despite a good deal of clouds with mainly lower
and middle 50s.

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
Any leftover rain comes to an end Thursday night with drier
conditions expected on Friday and most of Friday night as high
pressure briefly noses down from the north.

A complex low pressure system will be pushing in from the south and
west this weekend with rain chances as early as late Friday night,
but rain appears to be overall more likely Saturday afternoon
through Sunday. Still a chance that thermal profiles would be cold
enough well inland for a shot at a wintry mix at times, but with
only marginally cold air to begin with and high pressure retreating
instead of trying to build in, this looks to be mostly rain even for
these areas. High pressure then follows for Monday and Tuesday with
breezy, dry and cooler conditions.

.AVIATION /18Z TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure off the southern New Jersey coast at 17Z will move
over the area this afternoon and gradually weaken. Then low
then lifts northeast of the area tonight. Another wave of low
pressure approaches from the south Wednesday morning into
Wednesday afternoon.

IFR to LIFR. There may be a brief period of improvement to low
end MVFR late tonight. VLIFR is possible outside of the New York
City metro terminals toward Wednesday morning.

Northeast winds gradually diminish and become SE to S by late
afternoon, and may even become light and variable. There is a
lot of uncertainty and low confidence with the winds late
afternoon and into early this evening, and are dependent on the
timing and track of low pressure through the region. Winds will
likely become light and variable at all the terminals late
tonight, and then E to NE Wednesday morning as another wave of
low pressure approaches from the south.


   NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Amendments likely due to variable flight change categories.

Winds becoming lighter during the afternoon, and direction may
vary from SE to S before becoming SW around 5 kt early this
evening..

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...

Wednesday afternoon: IFR with rain developing by late afternoon.
IFR to LIFR at night with rain.

Thursday: MVFR or lower with a chance of rain. Winds N to NE
G20-25kt.

Friday: VFR.

Saturday: MVFR with a chance of rain early, then rain likely
late day and at night.

Sunday: MVFR with rain in the morning. Possibly VFR in the
afternoon with a chance of rain.

forecasts, can be found at: https:/www.weather.gov/zny/n90<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...
Seas increase to 5 to 6 ft today as an easterly flow becomes more
southerly late in the day and evening with marginal small craft gusts
on the ocean. Seas may briefly fall just below small craft criteria
Wednesday, but this looks to be short lived as seas increase by Wed
evening. The winds increase out of the north early Thu morning with
small craft conditions more likely across all waters during the day
Thursday with 6 to 8 ft seas.

Winds and seas diminish Thursday night with conditions falling below
advisory thresholds on the non-ocean waters by Friday morning. Seas
on the ocean will however remain elevated, partly due to swell, with
5+ ft seas lingering Friday through very early Saturday morning. An
onshore flow increases Saturday afternoon ahead of the next storm
system with advisory-level conditions on all waters Saturday
night.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
No hydrologic impacts are expected with today`s system with a
half inch to three quarters of an inch of rain.

WPC maintains a marginal to slight risk of excessive rainfall
Wednesday and Wednesday night. Rainfall totals will be on the
order of 1 to 2.5 inches, with as much as 3 inches locally
across eastern sections.

Potentially 1 to 1.50 inches of rain could fall with the following
storm system this weekend. Impacts with this event are still
somewhat uncertain as it will partly depend on the amount of rain
falling during the two rain events that will precede it.

&&

.OKX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CT...None.
NY...None.
NJ...None.
MARINE...Small Craft Advisory until 6 AM EST Wednesday for ANZ350-353-
     355.
