Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
206 AM PDT Sat May 31 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak frontal system will bring cooler temperatures
and rain on Saturday. Conditions will dry out Sunday into midweek
with temperature close to average.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showers return to western WA
today as an upper level trough cuts through the Pac NW. Most of
the shower activity will be along the coast this morning with
showers reaching the interior and Cascades by 20-21Z per HREF
model. Showers may linger in the central interior this evening
where there`s low level convergence, at least through 06Z.

N/NW flow prevails on Sunday and Monday with a ridge centered
offshore. We`ll see a mix of clouds and sunbreaks with
temperatures close to average. A few showers may clip the north
Cascades due to a disturbance over B.C. Otherwise, the rest of
western WA looks dry through the period. 33

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...High pressure remains
anchored offshore (along 140W) next week, with ongoing N/NW flow
over WA. The offshore ridge will deflect precip to our north
keeping the area dry. The low level flow remains onshore with
temperatures tracking close to early June averages. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft continues today as an upper trough
and weakening frontal system approach the area. Ceilings will lower
to MVFR at times in light showers in the vicinity of the front along
the coast and across interior areas mainly KPAE northward from 15Z
to 21Z. VFR is expected areawide behind the exiting front by late
this afternoon and evening. Gusty post-frontal westerly winds are
expected this afternoon and evening near the coast and areas
adjacent to the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

KSEA...Ceilings will lower as a weak front approaches, but are
expected to remain primarily VFR. Tempo high end MVFR ceilings in
brief showers are mostly likely with the front between 19Z and 21Z
this afternoon. Ceilings will lift back up behind the front late
this afternoon and evening. Surface winds becoming W/SW 5 to 10
knots ahead of the front this morning then veering N/NW 8 to 12
knots behind it around 19Z or 20Z. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow will increase later today into Sunday as
surface ridging builds strongly offshore behind an exiting frontal
system. This will lead to gusty northwest winds and choppy seas
across the coastal waters as well as a westerly push through the
strait. This general pattern remains in place into early next week
with onshore flow gradually easing as the offshore ridge weakens
toward the middle of next week.

The persistent onshore flow will generate seas at or above 10 feet
over portions of the outer coastal waters tonight into Sunday along
with some fairly short periods for steep seas. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
