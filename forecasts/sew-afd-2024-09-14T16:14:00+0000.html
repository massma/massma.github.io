Thursday with a weak system moving by to the north Friday.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The current forecast
remains on track with no planned updates this morning:

Upper level trough remaining over Western Washington today
keeping showers in the forecast and highs well below normal. Weak
vort max moving through this afternoon will increase the shower
activity. Increasing onshore flow behind this feature with
possible convergence zone over Snohomish county late in the
afternoon. Highs in the lower to mid 60s.

Trough remaining over the area tonight into Sunday but nothing
organized embedded in the trough. Convergnece zone dissipating in
the evening. With the somewhat unstable air mass scattered
showers will continue through Sunday. Shower activity will not be
as widespread as today. Temperatures remaining cool with some
breaks in the cloud cover allowing temperatures to drop into the
mid 40s to lower 50s Sunday morning. Highs Sunday afternoon again
in the lower to mid 60s.

Upper level trough sinking south Sunday night pulling the shower
activity with it out of the area, Skies clearing overnight. Monday
morning will be the coolest morning since June with some
locations as cool as the lower 40s. Mid 40s to near 50 for the
remainder of the area.

Western Washington in between features Monday with the upper level
trough to the south and an approaching front moving down the
British Columbia coast still well to the northwest. Even with
plenty of sunshine the temperatures aloft will not be very warm
keeping highs below normal, mid 60s to lower 70s.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Models showing good
consistency with a stretching out and weakening front moving
through Western Washington Tuesday night. Rain out ahead of the
front spreading over the area Tuesday. The increasing cloud cover
along with rain developing in the afternoon is a good recipe for
well below normal highs. Not expecting any record breaking low
maximums but it will still be a cool day with highs a couple of
degrees either side of 60. Lows in the 50s.

Post frontal trough digging south Wednesday with shower activity
decreasing during the day. Flat upper level ridge trying to build
into Western Washington Thursday. Weak shortwave riding by mainly
to the north Friday. While the operational runs are pretty much
dry Thursday and Friday the ensembles continue to show a few
solutions with light precipitation. The unimpressive upper level
ridging on the operational runs combined with the ensemble
solutions will keep a slight chance of showers in the forecast
both Thursday and Friday. Highs remaining a little below normal,
in the mid 60s.

Extended models are building a much stronger ridge next weekend
with increasing low level offshore flow for a possible warm start
to fall. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Flow aloft is west-southwest (becoming southwest).
Majority of terminals are MVFR this morning (though low mist/stratus
in IFR/LIFR continues for terminals along the Kitsap Peninsula up to
Paine Field, and northwest up to Friday Harbor, as well as the
northwest coastline). While the cold front did pass through
overnight, post-frontal convergence zone showers remain likely this
afternoon across most of east Puget Sound (especially in
King/Snohomish Counties). Brief heavy rain is possible with the
strongest of showers (though thunder threat remains very low). CIGs
may be slower to come up from ongoing drizzle/mist this morning, but
improvements to VFR are expected this afternoon (except convergence
zone showers will keep CIGs/VIS down in Shohomish/King County
areas). MVFR (with pockets of IFR) CIGs will redevelop overnight.
Winds out of the southwest 5 to 10 kt (couple gusts to 15kt near
Strait of Juan de Fuca and Southwest Interior), becoming northerly
by late tonight/Sunday. The winds may become variable mid afternoon
in convergence zone areas.

KSEA...MVFR CIGs continue this morning (with occasional drizzle
moving north out of the terminal on radar). Improvements to VFR
appear on track after 20Z this afternoon (however a convergence zone
with anywhere from light to heavy rain may hinder improvements out
of MVFR until later this evening). Winds are out of the southwest 5
to 10 kt until mid afternoon, as the convergence zone generates
variable north winds through the evening (few gusts to 15 kt
possible), becoming solidly north 5 to 10 kt overnight.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the Pacific waters and low pressure
inland will maintain onshore flow. Low cloud coverage with mist/fog
will be possible over all waterways Saturday and Sunday morning. A
post-frontal regime will increase westerlies down the strait this
evening as a SCA has been issued for the Central/Eastern sections.
Light to heavy convergence zone showers are expected this afternoon,
primarily for all inland waterways. Winds should ease into the early
morning hours on Sunday. Light northwest winds will continue Sunday
and into the rest of the week. Seas of 3 to 5 feet will build to 5
to 7 feet Sunday, dropping to 3 to 5 feet Monday before returning to
5 to 8 feet around midweek.
