.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough will continue to push inland
across the Pacific Northwest tonight, bringing in chances for
isolated showers and thunderstorms. An upper level ridge will
follow suit on Tuesday, allowing a return to warm and dry
conditions. A slow cooling trend is expected for this weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A dreary Labor Day
across western Washington with a firmly established marine stratus
layer blanketing the whole region. Stilt and radar imagery shows
a few light showers moving northward across the central Puget
Sound and central Cascades. A few lightning strikes were observed
with these showers this morning, but that has tapered off going
into this afternoon. Additional lightning is possible over the
Cascades, though activity should remain isolated. Stratus will
remain in place tonight, with some fog/light drizzle possible late
tonight into early tomorrow morning, especially along the Pacific
coast and the foothills of the Cascades. Temperatures across the
region remain in the 60s. Temperature may reach right around 70
later this afternoon, but not much warming is expected today. Lows
tonight in the 50s.

With the shortwave trough centered over Oregon ejecting eastward
tonight and ridging building back in beginning Tuesday, stratus
should clear out fairly quickly late tomorrow morning into
tomorrow afternoon. Highs will depend somewhat on how fast the
clouds clear out, but it will be slightly warmer with highs in the
low to mid 70s.

Temperatures will really begin to warm starting Wednesday as the
ridge becomes more centered over the area. A thermally induced
surface trough will build over the Washington coast, developing
light offshore flow. This will allow the airmass to warm and dry
out, with high temperatures Wednesday in the upper 70s to low 80s,
with mid to upper 80s possible in the Cascade and Olympic valleys.
Thursday looks to be the warmest day with the ridge axis directly
overhead. High temperatures rise into the mid 80s to low 90s, with
mid 90s possible in the Cascade valleys. There is quite a large
amount of model uncertainty regarding high temperatures along the
Pacific coast on Thursday, depending on the exact location of the
thermal trough and the timing of it moving inland and the flow
switching to onshore. The most likely solution allows highs to
rise into the low to mid 80s before onshore flow begins to cool
the coast, but if offshore flow is able to persist, temperatures
could be significantly warmer. This results in HeatRisk being
Moderate/Orange across almost the entire region, with some pockets
of Major/Red in the mountain valleys.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Friday will be another warm
day with the ridge beginning to depart and the thermal trough
moving eastward. Winds will be more solidly onshore which will
help the coast stay cool in the 70s. Elsewhere highs will be in
the 80s to low 90s in the Cascade valleys. Moderate/Orange
HeatRisk continues for Friday. Temperatures will begin a slow
cooling trend as the ridge continues to be pushed further east.
Ensembles are keying in on upper level troughing to develop just
offshore, which may set us up for the potential of slightly cooler
(though still slightly above average) temperatures and chances
for precipitation, but there remains discrepancies across the
ensembles on how far west the trough sets up and the evolution of
any shortwaves that progress through the trough.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough will continue to push inland
across the Pacific Northwest tonight, allowing for a ridge of
high pressure to move into western Washington on Tuesday.
Southwesterly flow aloft will transition to northwesterly by
tonight as a result. Onshore flow will persist in the low levels.

Conditions across the area terminals are generally trending MVFR
this afternoon, with a few spots still reporting IFR conditions.
Satellite imagery shows stratus draped across the low levels,
with mid to high level clouds continuing to stream overhead. Radar
indicates shower activity moving northward across the central
Sound and Cascades. Shower and isolated thunderstorm activity will
still be possible through the evening hours, but will primarily
be confined to the Cascades. Expect some slow improvement in area
ceilings across the region, but expect most terminals to remain
MVFR in cloud cover. A few spots may rebound to VFR by this evening,
however expect this trend to be short-lived. Ceilings look to lower
again into Tuesday, with most areas becoming more widespread MVFR
between 06-09Z. Ceilings look to scatter and return to VFR by the
afternoon on Tuesday.

KSEA...MVFR conditions at the terminal look to continue over the
next several hours. Brief improvement to VFR ceilings will be
possible by tonight, however expect ceilings to lower again
towards 1000-1500 ft by 09Z. Ceilings look to improve back to VFR
between 19-21Z Tuesday. Winds will persist out of the southwest,
generally at 4-8 kts.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An onshore flow pattern will continue into Tuesday.
Westerly winds along the Strait of Juan de Fuca will increase
this evening, generally persisting between 10-20 kt. Latest
guidance does hint at some gusts to 25 kt, however gusts did not
look frequent or widespread enough for advisory issuance at this
time.

A thermally induced trough will extend northward along the coast
on Wednesday, allowing for flow to transition to offshore on
Wednesday and persist through Thursday. The trough will move
inland on Friday, allowing for high pressure over the northeastern
Pacific to build back into the coastal waters and for flow to
transition back to onshore.

Seas are generally hovering between 4-7 ft across the coastal
waters this afternoon. Seas will subside to 3-5 ft by midweek
before building to 5-7 ft again on Thursday and Friday.

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow allowed for a return of cooler
and more moist air to Western Washington today. A few showers and
isolated thunderstorms moved across western Washington this morning.
While a possibility exists for a couple more storms this afternoon,
the chance has decreased with activity focused east of the Cascade
Crest. With drier fuels, the combination of lightning strikes and
low precipitation with these storms may be enough to start new
fires. Coverage of storms today is isolated in nature.

Warmer and drier conditions will return by mid week as upper level
ridging and surface troughing creates dry and unstable air over the
region. Mid Haines of 5`s and 6`s will result from high temperatures
in the upper 80s to low 90s Thursday, as well as light offshore
flow. The Thursday timeframe will be monitored for possible red flag
conditions, particularly over the Cascades.
