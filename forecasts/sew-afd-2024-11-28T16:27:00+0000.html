Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
827 AM PST Thu Nov 28 2024

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Fog or low stratus continues across the majority of the
lowlands of Western Washington early this morning with abundant
low-level moisture. Slow improvements to the visibilities are
expected later this morning, although some isolated areas will
remain in fog into the afternoon. There may be some brief periods
of sunshine today, with the better chance in the Cascades and
Olympics. Temperatures will be in the low to mid 40s for highs for
most areas.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Areas of fog continue this morning. A weak weather
system on Friday will bring cooler air and light precipitation to
portions of the region. High pressure builds over the region this
weekend, maintaining drier conditions through early next week.
Another front likely reaches the area around midweek.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Rather persistent pattern
in place for another day as high pressure is beginning to
establish itself across the eastern Pacific, with a few weak
disturbances riding the top of the ridge through southeastern
British Columbia. These will be the focus for a bit of enhanced
lift enough to maintain a few light showers across the northwestern
portions of the area early today, but these won`t be much in the
way of moisture down to the surface. The bigger story for this
Thanksgiving morning will be the fairly extensive fog and low
stratus across the majority of the lowlands. A dense fog advisory
is in effect through mid-morning for much of the area and those
heading out early this morning will want to give some extra time
for travel and be prepared for restricted visibility this morning.
With a drier northerly flow aloft developing today, expect
showers to taper and mostly confined to the coastline (though
can`t totally rule out a few elsewhere) and a mix of sun and
clouds in the afternoon after the morning fog.

A weak disturbance will slide south on Friday, bringing an
increased focus for some additional light showers and some cooler
air into the region. Accumulations will be quite modest outside of
some of the higher peaks of the mountains, and given this, travel
impacts are not expected. High pressure continues to rebuild over
the northeastern Pacific late Friday and will shift eastward into
Saturday. With the strengthening inversion, expect a mix of shallow
fog and low clouds each morning, and perhaps some increasing
clouds with the region transitioning to more northwesterly flow,
depending on where the ridge axis becomes established. Regardless,
overnight lows the next few nights will begin to dip a few degrees
cooler with some of the more outlying locations dipping into the
lower 30s.                                                  12

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...The start of next week
still looks to be dominated by a ridge of high pressure over the
region, with strong support in the ensemble guidance. Confidence
begins to decrease a bit with respect to the amplitude and a
positioning of the ridge, with most ensemble members maintaining
it firmly in place and around 20% shifting it enough to open the
door for a return of westerly flow and some higher potential for
showers to return. With this uncertainty remaining larger into the
midweek period, it`s worth noting a shift that the next front with
a deeper plume of moisture may begin to reach into the Pacific
Northwest. Meanwhile, temperatures trend near or slightly above
normal for the first half of next week.                      12

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow aloft as an upper level ridge builds
across the northeast Pacific and into western Washington. South and
central Puget Sound continues to see thick fog this morning, with
visibilities down to a quarter of a mile (couple localized areas
seeing less than a quarter). Passing mid and upper level clouds over
Snohomish county and north is limiting some of the fog development,
and those cigs remain MVFR to VFR at this time (fog remains offshore
from the Paine Field Camera). There could be some additional fog
development in some spots this morning but conditions are already
improving to above 1 mile visibility in places such as Olympia and
Bellingham. Timing for fog to clear remains on track between 18Z-21Z
(last areas to clear will be along the I-5 corridor between Olympia
and SeaTac). Additionally, given that the ridge is more established
over the area, there is likely going to be another round of fog and
lower cigs tonight, setting in generally after 00Z to 03Z. Winds
will remain very light (either calm or less than 3 kt out of the
north).

KSEA...Dense fog continues and is expected to linger through 18-21Z.
One-sixteenth of a mile visibilities and RVRs of less than 1000 feet
will likely persist through mid to late morning. Light northeasterly
flow of 3 to 5 kt likely throughout the majority of the TAF period.
Sunrise won`t bring immediate reprieve from the fog, but
visibilities will climb subtly to a quarter mile late this morning.
The high resolution model guidance is struggling to resolve the fog,
and given the pattern, the probabilities of seeing IFR to LIFR cigs
are far too low. Unrestricted visibilities and a return to cigs of
3000 ft are more likely after 20Z. Another round of fog is expected
late tonight, primarily after 06Z.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Couple areas of fog continue this morning over
primarily the Puget Sound and Hood Canal waters. Localized areas of
low visibilities down to a half or a quarter of a mile are expected
to continue through late this morning. Another round of fog is
expected late tonight with the current pattern.

High pressure will continue to dominate over the coastal waters
through the rest of the week and into the weekend. A weak system
will just clip the region to the north on Friday for light chances
of precipitation. The next system to move through the area does not
look to arrive until early next week. Redevelopment of the fog is
likely this evening. Winds remain light northwesterly across the
coastal waters through the week, becoming southerly this weekend.

Seas 2 to 4 ft through the week, increasing to 6 to 8 ft this
weekend as long period swell arrives to the area from a system over
Alaska.
