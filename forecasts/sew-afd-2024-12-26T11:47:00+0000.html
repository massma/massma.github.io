Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Front moving through Western Washington early this
morning followed by a bent back occlusion later this morning.
Winds will increase rapidly later this morning as the bent back
feature moves through the area. After a short break tonight a
weaker weather system will arrive Friday. Additional systems will
move through Saturday morning, Sunday and later Monday. Possible
atmospheric river arriving in the middle of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
front moving through Western Washington early this morning with a
bent back occlusion off the coast at 11z/3am. Rain continues over
most of the area with snow in the higher elevations. Winds have
already picked up along the Central Coast with Hoquiam reporting
gusts to 45 mph. Temperatures were in the mid 40s over the
interior and near 50 degrees along the coast.

Satellite imagery and doppler radar showing the bent back
occlusion very clearly early this morning. Surface pressure has
started to rise at both Destruction Island and Buoy 41 off the
coast. The surface pressure bottomed out at 984 mb in both
locations which matches up well with model solutions. Pressure is
still falling at Quillayute but the winds which were easterly are
starting to come around to south southeasterly. The surface low is
therefore a little south and west of Quillayute at 11z. 00z models
in good agreement that near 984 mb low would be near Cape
Flattery at 12z. Low tracking eastward but weakening 12z-18z
ending up near the east entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca by
18z. This track will create a quick increase in pressure
gradients across the interior from about Snohomish county
southward. The Olympia to Bellingham surface gradient will go from
near 0 at 12z to plus 7 to 9 mb at 18z resulting in a rapid
increase in southerly winds around 15z/7 am over the interior.
In addition to the southerlies in the interior the surface
gradient through the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the Quillayute to
Bellingham gradient, will go from around -4 mb to plus 6 mb
resulting in a strong push of westerly winds down the Strait of
Juan de Fuca into Whidbey Island. There will also be an area of
convergence between the strong southerly coming up the Puget Sound
interior and the westerlies through the Strait creating an area
of not very strong winds between around Everett and Arlington.
As the low continues to weaken and move northeast winds will ease
all areas this afternoon.

The current forecast with high wind warnings for the coast, Northwest
Interior, San Juans and Admiralty Inlet this morning with a wind
advisory for the remainder of the lowlands looks good and no
changes will be made in the upcoming forecast package. One thing
to keep in mind is the rapid increase in the winds as well as a
quick change in wind direction will increase the chances for
power outages and downed trees even though the actual wind speeds
will be lower than what is usually needed to create these impacts.

In the mountains snow continuing today pretty good orographics
behind the bent back keeping snow going into the evening hours.
The Winter Storm Warning for the Cascades will continue until 10
pm tonight while in the Olympics the warning will come to an end
at 4 pm this afternoon.

A little break in the action tonight before the next system
approaches the area late tonight. Front is becoming more
negatively tilted with the jet diving into Northern California
which will slow the eastward progression down pushing the onset of
rain back until after midnight. There were some concerns about the
surface low associated with this system with previous model runs
putting the low center near the mouth of the Columbia River
Friday. 00z model runs have a weaker surface low with a little
further south track which will keeps winds in check over Western
Washington.

Front moving through Friday with another negatively tilted front
approaching by the end of the day. This feature will move through
Friday night into Saturday morning. Surface low associated with
this front moving inland over Vancouver Island Saturday which
could create some breezy/windy conditions over the Northwest
Interior.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement with the wet pattern staying intact over Western
Washington but a little more spacing between the systems for
longer breaks in the steady rain. Another system arriving Sunday
followed by a weaker one later Monday. Models have been pretty
consistent indicating a possible atmospheric river developing
midweek producing more significant rains over the area Wednesday
and possibly Thursday. None of these features have impactful winds
associated with them although there will be a pop of post frontal
southerly late Sunday. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft in the early morning before
becoming more westerly by mid-morning and remaining that way into
tonight. South to southeasterly surface winds will become more south
to southwesterly and significantly increasing in speed as well as
gusts. Current obs /as of 10Z or 2 AM PST/ showing SEA, BFI, PWT,
BLI and CLM have all yet to ramp up, reporting wind speeds generally
5-10 kts...but are expected to do so by 12Z or 4 AM PST. As they do
so, most of these sites will see sustained winds 15-20 kt with gusts
up to 35 kts. In the meantime, sites already blowing /HQM, OLM, PAE/
seeing winds of 15-20 kts and gusts up to 40 kts. PAE is on the
lower end of this and is expected to nudge upward by 12Z, while HQM
and OLM should be close to their peak winds now. All sites expected
to see winds ease gradually this afternoon into this evening.

Cigs largely VFR across W WA, although MVFR cigs present along the
coast and as far inland as SHN and the Chehalis River valley and as
such will likely see conditions erode to widespread MVFR between 12-
15Z. Rainfall rates may allow for brief dips down into low-end MVFR
or IFR conditions. Model data suggests that once rains taper off
this evening, some recovery back to low-end VFR conditions will be
expected for most terminals, however those more prone to lower cigs
and fog may only see a brief period of VFR conditions this evening
before dipping back down into MVFR given abundant low-level moisture.

KSEA...VFR conditions in place for the time being, however should
see rain and accompanying MVFR conditions materialize at the
terminal between 12-15Z...a little behind current TAF timing. Above
discussion regarding winds will kick in with this timing as well.
LLWS will linger as well, becoming less of an issue by mid-morning.
Window for peak winds, given the late start, will similarly be
pushed back, but should still see speeds start o ease after 21Z with
gusts tapering off by 00Z. During the peak period, gusts up to 35
kts remain possible before easing to closer to 25 kts.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Active weather remains on tap across the region. Multiple
headlines remain in place and will generally remain that way at
least into this evening. Wind-driven headlines will see some
downgrade late this morning/this afternoon as winds ease from west
to east. Monitor latest forecasts and statements to see areas
impacted...although winds linger the longest over the coastal waters
and the Eastern Strait. Seas become the next issue, not only
allowing for prolonging headlines over the coastal waters, but also
giving rise to high surf concerns for the coast as seas ranging 20-
24 ft will continue to be a threat until gradually easing late this
afternoon/early this evening. As if these were not enough, the
combination of tides and strength of low pressure overhead is also
giving rise to coastal flooding concerns in the Strait. Inundation
forecasts still showing water 2 to 2.5 feet above ground level,
allowing for minor flooding of shorelines and low-lying coastal
areas. This threat should also ease by the early afternoon.

An additional weather system expected tonight into Friday may give
rise to additional headlines or extensions of those already present,
but have tried to tackle as much of this as possible with morning
forecast package. This disturbance has trended further south towards
the mouth of the Columbia so the strongest winds are to be over the
OR coastal waters. Nevertheless, an active pattern is likely to
remain over the weekend and possibly into next week, bringing an
additional period of stronger winds.

As stated, seas today generally 20-24 ft for much of the day before
easing down to 15-18 ft this evening before ramping back to up to 20-
24 ft by Friday morning. In a lather, rinse, repeat style pattern,
seas then ease back to 15-18 ft Friday afternoon. This oscillation
persists before finally settling below 10 ft on Monday.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Total precipitation for this latest front looks to be
mostly in the two to four inch range for the Olympics with some
five inch bullseye. This will push the Skokomish river into
moderate flood stage today. The remainder of the river flowing off
the Olympics will remain below flood stage.

While precipitation will be less with the systems beginning Friday
the lack of much of a break will keep rivers over the Southwest
Interior rising into the weekend. It`s possible that the lower
reaches of the Chehalis could flood late Friday into Saturday. The
Skookumchuck near Bucoda and the Newaukum near Chehalis could
reach action stage late Friday into Saturday.

Rivers across the remainder of the area will also be on the rise
in the next few days but the combination of a less precipitation
and a little cooler temperatures in the Cascades will keep the
rivers flowing off the Cascades in their banks through the weekend
into early next week.

With all of the precipitation the landslide threat will continue
to increase into the weekend. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.CLIMATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Seattle-Tacoma airport got 0.86 inches of rain
yesterday. The airport has still not recorded a one inch plus
rain day this year. In 80 years of records there there has never
been a year without at least one one inch plus rain day at
Seattle-Tacoma airport.

Some snow totals for the last 24 hours ending at 3 am...Mount
Baker 20 inches, Stevens Pass 9 inches, Snoqualmie pass 11 inches,
White pass 10 inches, Paradise on Mount Rainier 18 inches,
Crystal Mountain 16 inches. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
