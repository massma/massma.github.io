Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
337 PM PDT Sun Jul 21 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A shortwave will eject out of the area tonight as the
elevated shower/thunderstorm threat subsides. Stout low-level
onshore flow and upper-level troughing will build into the region
to start the week. A welcomed return of near normal conditions are
expected for the next several days.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A subtle shortwave has
ejected out of an upper-low positioned in the Gulf of Alaska into
PNW here this afternoon. With it, widespread elevated showers and
isolated thunderstorms spilled into W WA. This activity will
continue before ending entirely by the early evening. As the
aforementioned shortwave lifts into British Columbia strong low-
level onshore flow will replace it tonight as an intrusion of
marine cooled air and stratus enters W WA. Going forward, we`ll
see a welcomed return of near normal conditions for the next
several days. Overnight lows are to fall into the 50s with the
warmest spots in and around the Seattle metro.

As advertised, some natural AC is bringing much cooler
conditions. Widespread marine stratus will drape the skies to
start the day before gradually burning off later in the afternoon.
Highs for Monday may even be a few degrees below average as
interior locations top out in the low to mid 70s. Coastal areas
are to remain in the 60s. Much of the same is expected through
Wednesday with some degree of morning stratus and afternoon sun.
An upper-level trough will settle over BC during this time. Lower
heights aloft will keep temperatures hovering around average for
mid to late July. Conditions are to remain mostly dry barring the
chance for mist squeezing out of marine stratus. The HREF Grand
Ensemble is currently hinting a very weak PSCZ activity Monday
evening but confidence is marginal at this time.


.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Broad upper level
troughing remains over the Pacific Northwest throughout the
upcoming week, with varying degrees of onshore flow, morning
stratus, and temperatures hovering around normal. Moisture
associated with the upper-level trough is bringing increased PoPs
to the N Cascades Thursday morning but confidence is leaning
towards mostly dry conditions. As of now, no significant weather
is expected in the long term.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge centered over the Intermountain
West will continue to shift eastward over the next day as an
upper level trough over the NE Pacific starts to move into the
region. This will maintain southerly flow aloft through the TAF
period. Instability will continue to increase across the Cascades
over the next several hours, so isolated thunderstorms will be
possible through this evening. Increasing onshore flow tonight
will help push marine stratus into the interior by early Monday
morning, likely bringing some IFR to low MVFR ceilings to the
Sound terminals. Stratus will then scatter through the morning
hours, with widespread conditions returning to VFR by Monday
afternoon.

KSEA...VFR conditions with some mid to high level moisture
associated with elevated instability overhead. Surface winds
persisting out of the W/NW at 6-8 kt. Winds will then ease
tonight and shift to the S/SW after 09Z Monday. Stratus looks to
push into the terminal between 12-15Z and could bring conditions
down to low MVFR to even IFR for a few hours. Stratus will then
scatter between 18-21Z for a return to VFR conditions.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow will continue through much of the week with
high pressure situated over the offshore waters and lower pressure
situated east of the Cascades. A series of weak troughs moving
into British Columbia will increase onshore flow at times over the
next several days.

The first in a round of onshore pushes will commence tonight, with
gales likely into early Monday across the central and eastern
Strait of Juan de Fuca. Another push of westerlies will occur Monday
afternoon into Tuesday, with latest probabilistic guidance hinting
at a 40-50% chance of gusts reaching 34 kt across portions of the
central and east Strait Monday night. Have issued a Gale Watch for
now, but will need to see how this trends over the next day.

Seas generally persisting at 5-7 ft this afternoon will gradually
subside to 3-6 ft on Monday. Seas then look to hover between this
range through midweek.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A Red Flag Warning will continue for zones 658,
and 659 tonight with the continued threat for isolated dry
thunderstorms. Zones 652 and 661 will be canceled as thunderstorm
chances have largely diminished. Going forward, an intrusion of
marine cool air and high relative humidities will set up tonight
into Monday. This robust onshore pattern looks to continue into
Tuesday as well and throughout the remainder of the week but of
varying degrees. This reprieve looks to keep fire weather concerns
to a minimum going forward.
