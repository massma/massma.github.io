Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong weather system will continue to move across
the Pacific Northwest today, bringing widespread precipitation and
gusty winds to western Washington. Showery and cool conditions
will persist through Thursday before an upper ridge brings a
short break in the active weather to the area on Friday. Cool and
unsettled conditions return over the weekend and persist into
early next week as another system moves into western Washington.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong system continues to
make its way into the region early this morning, bringing moderate
to heavy rain to the lowlands, snow the mountains, and gusty
winds to western Washington. Snow levels are around 5000-6500 ft
across the region early this morning with a warm front draped
along the coast. Expect snow levels to fall to 4000-5000 ft
throughout the day as the trailing cold front makes its way across
the region. The system`s parent upper low will remain offshore
today before pushing inland later on Thursday, which will maintain
wet and unsettled conditions across western Washington.

The bulk of the moisture with this system remains centered over
the Olympics and North Cascades. Latest observations show that
roughly 1-3 inches of rain has already fallen across the Olympic
Peninsula over the past 12 hours - and expect additional amounts
of 1-3 inches of rain to fall through the day today. The North
Cascades will also see a larger influx of moisture, with around 4
inches of liquid possible through Thursday. Higher elevations of
the mountains will see heavy snow at times throughout the period.
Higher Cascade passes, like Stevens, will likely only see a few
inches of snow through Thursday.

Details on the additional hazards associated with this system
have been outlined below:

WIND: Winds have have been gusty along the coast and for areas
from Whidbey Island northward overnight. Latest observations have
shown that winds have started to ease along the coast already,
though can expect gusts to 55 mph to remain possible through the
early morning hours for areas generally from Admiralty Inlet
northward. Elsewhere, winds will remain breezy through the early
morning hours and will gradually diminish through the late morning
and afternoon.

MOUNTAIN SNOW: The bulk of snowfall with this system still
remains on track to fall across the North Cascades. Snow levels
will generally hover between 4000-5500 feet, allowing for periods
of heavy snow across the higher elevations of the mountains. A
winter storm warning remains in effect for 12-24 inches of snow
through Thursday. At this time, only light snow accumulations
expected for passes above 4000 ft.

RIVER FLOODING: Rises to area rivers will continue with widespread
rain moving across the region today. With an additional 1-3
inches of rain expected across the Olympic Peninsula, expect
Olympic basin rivers to continue to see the most significant
rises. The Skokomish River has made it into flood stage early this
morning and expect the Bogachiel to continue to rise. For more
information on river flooding, see the hydro section below.

THUNDERSTORMS: Isolated thunderstorms will be possible along the
Pacific coast today into early Thursday and will be capable of
producing gusty winds, small hail, lightning, and brief heavy
downpours. A brief waterspout cannot be ruled out.

COASTAL FLOODING: Coastal flooding due to tidal overflow and storm
surge will be possible along the shorelines and low-lying coastal
areas of the Pacific around high tide this morning. Inundation of
2-2.5 feet above ground level will be possible. The potential for
coastal flooding along the Pacific and the inner coast will
continue into Thursday and will continue to be monitored.

Scattered shower activity will continue through Thursday, though
expect precipitation to gradually taper through the day. Friday
will see a brief break in the active weather as the trough axis
moves off to the east and upper ridging briefly nudges into the
region.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Wet and unsettled conditions
look likely over the weekend as another, cooler system moves into
the region. Snow levels falling to 2500-3000 feet will bring more
substantial snow to the mountains, with accumulating snowfall
expected at the Cascade passes. Showery conditions look to persist
into Monday. Forecast details become a bit more uncertain heading
into Tuesday, however. Latest guidance does hint at the potential
for an upper level ridge to build into the region for another
break in the active weather pattern. Will need to see how this
continues to trend over the coming days. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft continues with an upper trough axis
situated offshore and a vigorous front moving onshore over Western
Washington early this morning. An unstable air mass will follow
the front with stratiform rain turning over to frequent showers,
isolated thunderstorms, and a mix of MVFR and low end VFR
ceilings. Very gusty surface winds and low level wind shear will
ease behind the front, but breezy southerly surface winds are
likely to persist through the day.

KSEA...VFR ceilings lowering to MVFR behind the front 15z-20z.
Low level wind shear persists through 15z with southerly winds aloft
at 2000 feet around 45 knots. Surface winds southerly 15 to 25 knots
this morning easing to 10 to 15 kt in the afternoon.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A very strong warm front moved onshore around 1 AM PST
(09Z). Full gales and isolated storm force gusts over the coastal
waters will ease to small craft advisory strength this morning.
Winds will ease over the interior waters as well, but small craft
advisory conditions will continue into late this evening. A broad
surface trough over the coastal waters today will gradually weaken
then shift inland on Thursday as ridging rebuilds well offshore.
This will lead to a quieter period Thursday night through Friday
night. Another frontal system will reach the waters on Saturday with
headlines likely for most of the waters this weekend. Hazardous seas
of 16 to 20 feet will begin to subside later today, but are expected
to remain at or above 10 feet into early Friday. A return of double
digit seas is expected later in the weekend as another larger swell
train arrives behind the weekend frontal system.    27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Rises to area rivers will continue with widespread
rain moving across the region today. Additional rainfall amounts
of 1 to 3 inches, with locally higher amounts to 4 inches, will be
possible over the Olympic Peninsula through Thursday afternoon.
Thus, expect the Olympic basin rivers to continue to see the most
significant rises. The Skokomish River has made it into minor
flood stage early this morning and will continue to rise, approaching
moderate flood stage today. A Flood Watch remains in effect for
the Bogachiel River near La Push, which is forecast to continue to
rise into action stage today.

Expect rises on area rivers elsewhere, however, do not expect any
river flooding at this time. Snow levels will lower to 4000 ft by
tonight, which will continue to impact precipitation type and the
amount of storm runoff. Any additional flooding extent will
continue to depend on rainfall rates, temperatures, and snow
levels--and will continue to be monitored through the period. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
