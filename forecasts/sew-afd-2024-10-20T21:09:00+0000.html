Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
209 PM PDT Sun Oct 20 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A front will continue to move eastward for rain,
breezy winds across Western Washington today. Troughing will bring
cooler temperatures, unsettled weather Monday into early Tuesday.
Dry conditions mid-week with active weather likely returning later
Friday into next weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front is
currently progressing eastward across the Olympic Peninsula this
afternoon with steadier rainfall with the front. Breezy southerly
winds also continue ahead of the front for Puget Sound and
interior areas, with gusts peaking across Admiralty Inlet, the
strongest gusts being observed at Whidbey Island NAS. Southerly
winds will remain breezy with a Wind Advisory in place for these
areas through the afternoon, winds will then slowly taper post-
frontal this evening. Of note, west winds will increase through
the Strait of Juan de Fuca this evening, with gusts ranging 25 to
40 MPH during this period for Whidbey Island and perhaps Port
Townsend. Otherwise, post-frontal onshore flow will lead to the
development of weak convergence, generally over Admiralty Inlet,
and adjacent areas around Snohomish County for light rain at times
into tonight.

Troughing will shift overhead Monday into early Tuesday for
continued unsettled weather and periodic showers. Snow levels on
Monday will range 4000 to 5000 feet, falling to near 3500 feet
Tuesday morning as precipitation tapers. In addition, temperatures
will cool Monday with the cooler airmass, with highs on Monday and
Tuesday in the mid 50s for most areas.

Although likely not impactful, guidance has trended towards more
of a weak troughing signal on Wednesday. Ensembles generally keep
Western Washington dry on Wednesday, however, will have to
monitor any lingering low-level moisture. At this point, lower
clouds will likely be around Wednesday morning, perhaps lingering
into the afternoon. Otherwise, temperatures look to cool Tuesday
night into Wednesday morning into the 30s away from the water, and
will have to monitor any frost potential, particularly in Cascade
Valleys and Southwest Interior.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Drier weather is expected
at least for the majority of Thursday with light westerly flow
aloft. Troughing will begin to develop further offshore Thursday
night into Friday, allowing for an increase in precipitation for
Western Washington. Some uncertainty exists in ensembles as to the
timing of precipitation, have kept NBM at this time which
introduces a chance beginning Thursday night, but expect the
better potential later on Friday. Southwest flow aloft will
further increase into Saturday, with a better chance for
precipitation, along with perhaps breezy winds. Unsettled weather
looks to continue into Sunday as well with continued troughing
over the NE Pacific. Temperatures expected to be near to slightly
below normal late next week. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Strong west flow aloft with several troughs moving
through western Washington. A surface cold front is currently
progressing through the area this afternoon. A band of light to
moderate rain will pass through the region. With that, expecting
ceilings to lower down to MVFR, potentially locally IFR in heavier
rain, as the front passes through. Following the frontal passage,
the ceiling forecast gets a bit tricky--expecting ceilings to remain
below 3000-4000 ft, but chances for conditions to remain VFR through
the overnight period are highest in the Seattle area and southward,
while MVFR to IFR conditions are expected to remain in the northwest
interior and the northern Pacific coast. Some patchy fog may develop
in the fog-prone valleys in the morning on Monday.

During the day on Monday, scattered showers associated with a weak
low pressure system will keep the atmosphere moist, allowing
ceilings to stay low (at or below 3500 ft). MVFR to low end VFR
conditions will prevail.

Winds breezy this afternoon from the south, 15 to 25 kt with gusts
25 to 35 kt. Weak low level wind shear continues to be a potential
threat ahead of the frontal passage. Winds will subside tonight. On
Monday, winds remain south/southwesterly 5 to 10 kt.

KSEA...VFR conditions just ahead of the incoming frontal passage.
A period of light to moderate rain as well as ceilings lowering,
potentially to MVFR, are expected with the front. Breezy
southwesterly winds 10-15 kt with gusts 20-30 kt this afternoon.
CIGs raising to low-end VFR early this evening following the frontal
passage. Ceilings remain low (at or below 3500 ft) with scattered
showers in the area on Monday, potentially reaching MVFR at times.
Winds becoming light southerly tonight, and remaining southerly 5 to
10 kt on Monday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front situated over the coastal waters will
continue to work its way westward across the area through this
afternoon and tonight. Winds currently remain breezy across all
coastal and interior waters. Winds should drop off quickly across
the coastal waters behind the frontal passage this afternoon.
Winds remain breezy through the interior waters as southerly winds
drop off, followed by a quick westerly push down the Strait of Juan
de Fuca early tonight. Another weak low pressure system will pass
through the area waters on Monday, but winds look to remain under
thresholds. High pressure will build across the area from the
northwest, keeping conditions benign for most of the week.
Models are signaling the next system arriving sometime Friday into
next weekend, which could bring the next round of active weather to
the area.

Seas 8 to 10 ft will subside tonight and tomorrow to 3 to 5 ft by
Tuesday and remain like so through the week.

HYDROLOGY...Rivers continue to recede following the atmospheric
river event the last 48 hours. A front moving across the Olympic
Peninsula will continue to track eastward into Puget Sound and
Cascades through this evening. Additional QPF amounts will likely
range 0.25-1.00" for the Cascades and Olympics. Although brief
rises on area rivers are possible with this front, river flooding
is not expected given the rather brief period of steadier rain. We
continue to monitor rivers that have recently crested this
afternoon, particularly Nooksack River at Ferndale, as well as the
Skokomish River at Potlach, but river flooding is not expected for
these locations, despite the additional rainfall. Showers will
linger on Monday, with drier weather expected the middle of next
week, allowing rivers to level off and recede. JD
