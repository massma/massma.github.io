Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
826 PM EDT Mon Sep 4 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure remains in control through midweek. High pressure
begins to weaken Wednesday night into Thursday as a cold front
slowly approaches from the west through Friday. The front moves
into the region Friday night into Saturday, lingering nearby
into Sunday as waves of low pressure move along the front. High
pressure builds to the north Monday.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM TUESDAY MORNING/...
A high amplitude upper level ridge east of the Mississippi
River Valley and a blocking upper low over the western Atlantic
will allow for an unusually warm airmass to settle across the
region for the first half of the week. 85H temps increased to
around 18C today and will remain or slightly increase through
mid week.

A weak shortwave approaches this evening, however, BUFKIT
soundings, and latest HRRR showing a low level cap in place,
with 3000-3500 J/kg, and instability in place. With nothing
having developed across the lower Hudson Valley, with the
shortwave moving into the region, have removed the chances for
precipitation.

Lows tonight will be about 10 degrees above normal, upper 60s
to mid 70s.

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
Not much change during this period as the upper level ridge
translates a bit father east, but once again being blocked by an
upper low offshore. Above normal heat will continue through
Wednesday.

A Heat Advisory remains in effect for all of northeast
NJ, except western Passaic, through Wednesday. The Heat Advisory has
been expanded to include NYC and portions of the Lower Hudson
Valley. Confidence is highest in these areas that a heat index of 95
will be met at anytime during each of the two days over much of
the forecast zone. Isolated heat index values of 95 may be
reached across other areas of the Lower Hudson Valley and in CT,
but they will not be widespread. The biggest uncertainty
remains across CT with high cloud cover moving in for at least
the first half of Tuesday. This will have to continue to be
monitored.

This period will remain dry and mostly sunny for most. Lows remain
above normal.

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
A high amplitude and large subtropical ridge over the eastern states
begins to weaken and translate slowly eastward Wednesday night and
Thursday. Meanwhile, a closed, and nearly cutoff, low over the
northwestern Atlantic remains south of Nova Scotia and drifts east
and north Thursday into Friday as a northern stream shortwave
approaches from the west and the upper ridge moves into the western
Atlantic. The high amplitude ridge increases over the western
Atlantic Friday and Friday night and remains into Sunday. This will
establish a nearly blocking Omega pattern, and keep the shortwave
and surface low to the west, or moves slowly eastward through the
upcoming weekend. Until then heat and humidity will remain across
the region Thursday, with temperatures once again reaching the lower
90s, possibly mid 90s, inland, and upper 80s to near 90 across the
coastal areas.
And with dew points remaining around 70 heat indices reach the mid
to upper 90s. However, there is some uncertainty, as clouds will be
increasing and there will be a chance of showers and thunderstorms
Thursday afternoon. But with the latest trends with the ridge
remaining and keeping the shortwave to the west, the onset of
precipitation may be delayed. The warm and humid airmass remains
into Friday, however 850mb temperatures are a couple of degrees
cooler than previous forecasts, and chances of precipitation remain.

With the slow moving upper shortwave and waves of low pressure
moving along the cold front, and precipitable water values mainly
1.50 to 1.75 inches, periods of moderate to heavy rain will be
possible. The front at this time moves east Sunday with high pressure
beginning to build to the north Monday.

.AVIATION /00Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will remain offshore through the TAF period.

No further shower activity expected. Dry and VFR conditions
expected through the TAF period. There is a low chance for some
patchy fog and low stratus at KGON overnight into early Tuesday
morning.

Winds become light, 5 kts or less, with variable direction
tonight into Tuesday morning. Winds become northerly near 5-7
kts late Tuesday morning into Tuesday afternoon. Winds return
to more southerly flow with the sea breeze first for CT
terminals late Tuesday morning. The sea breeze moves in early Tuesday
afternoon at KJFK and KISP and more towards late afternoon into
early evening for KLGA, KHPN, KEWR as well as KTEB. Winds will
be near 7-10 kts Tuesday afternoon. Winds stay more northerly at
KSWF for the entire afternoon.


     NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

KLGA forecast to have Sound breeze from NE much of the day
Tuesday before more southerly sea breeze late. Timing of this
more southerly sea breeze may vary 1-2 hours from TAF.

Timing of sea breeze at KJFK, KEWR, and KTEB may vary 1-3 hours
from TAF.

OUTLOOK FOR 00Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

Tuesday night-Wednesday night: VFR.

Thursday: Mainly VFR. Slight chance for a late afternoon into
early evening shower or thunderstorm near NYC terminals and to
the north and west. Higher chances of mid to late evening
showers and thunderstorms near NYC terminals and to the north
and west with slight chances of mid to late evening showers and
thunderstorms east of NYC terminals.

Friday through Saturday: MVFR possible at times. Chance for showers
and thunderstorms. Showers and thunderstorms likely near KSWF
Saturday afternoon into early Saturday evening. SE wind gusts
15-20 kt Saturday afternoon.

.MARINE...
Made only minor adjustments to the wind speeds for current
conditions this evening. Otherwise, no changes to the winds and
seas through tonight.

Ocean seas generally remain around 3 ft through mid week,
however, an ESE swell from offshore low pressure nearing the
Canadian Maritimes could increase seas to around 4 ft late
tonight into Tuesday.

High pressure begins to weaken Wednesday night into Thursday as a
frontal system approaches from the west. The frontal system moves
slowly through the region Friday into Sunday. Despite a persistent
southerly flow ahead of the frontal system, winds and seas are
forecast to remain below SCA levels at this time.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
No hydrologic impacts are expected through Thursday.

A significant rainfall of 1/2 to 1 inch, with locally higher amounts,
is possible late Friday through Saturday as a frontal boundary moves
slowly through the region. There is still too much uncertainty with
the timing and areal extent of the rainfall.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
Long period ESE swells of around 3ft and 9-11s continue through
Tuesday, with a moderate rip current risk at the ocean beaches.
While these swells begin to diminish on Wednesday, a moderate risk
remains for the Nassau and Suffolk beaches, with a low risk at the
New York City beaches.

&&

.CLIMATE...
Some daily record highs could be tied or broken over the next
couple of days. The record highs for these dates are below.
