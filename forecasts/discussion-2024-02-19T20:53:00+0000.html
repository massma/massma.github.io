Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
353 PM EST Mon Feb 19 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Canadian maritimes high pressure remains in control through
Wednesday, then weakens into Thursday. A frontal system will bring
unsettled weather Thursday night through Friday, followed by high
pressure for the weekend. There is potential for a cold front to
move through the area late Sunday night through Monday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 8 AM TUESDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Longwave northern stream trough over northern New England/SE
Canada gradually slides east tonight into Tuesday. At the
surface, Canadian high pressure continues to build slowly east
into the northeast US, continuing dry conditions.

Good radiational cooling conditions will have outlying areas falling
down into the lower teens, with mid 20s for NYC/NJ metro.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /8 AM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Split upper flow regime to start with northern stream longwave
trough sliding east of the Canadian Maritimes through Tue Night,
while a deepening PAC shortwave slides east across the SE US
and offshore by midweek (with a weak southern low shearing north
towards the region). This will evolve into a more zonal (PAC
dominant) upper flow for mid to late week.

At the surface, Canadian high pressure slides east across the NE US
on Tue and then slowly drifts east of the Canadian maritimes Tue
Night thru Wed Night, while nosing back SW across the region.
Meanwhile an offshore low develops in response to PAC shortwave
over the Gulf Stream and slowly drifts NE (NW of Bermuda) through
mid week.

Dry conditions prevail thru the period with modifying continental
polar airmass on Tue transitioning to a Canadian maritime airmass
thru midweek. There continues to be a signal for possible stratus
development during the Tue Night into Wed Night period with onshore
flow under subsidence inversion.

Temps will run a few degrees below seasonable on Tue under the
southern periphery of the polar high, moderating towards seasonable
on Wed with maritime NE flow. Overnight low temps will be predicated
on stratus development.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will be weakening over the area ahead of an
approaching frontal system to start on Thursday. The daylight hours
will feature normal temperatures and increasing clouds from the
west. PoPs increase by the evening hours and become likely overnight
into Friday morning. PoPs remain likely through Friday and then
taper off Friday night leading to a dry weekend. A mainly plain rain
event is expected, with just a slight chance of a wintry mix across
portions of the far northern interior. QPF has been trending lighter
and lighter, with the latest NBM run showing only around a 20
percent chance of seeing 0.50 inches.

The flow becomes northwest Friday night and a cold and dry airmass
advects in, with high pressure nosing in from the south and west for
the weekend. Aloft, an upper level low remains to the north and will
keep the area under cyclonic flow through much of the weekend. Model
spread then increases heading into early next week. There is
potential for a cold front to move through the area and bring more
rain, but there are disagreements in timing and intensity. For now,
capped PoPs at slight chance Sunday night into Monday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /20Z MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure builds in from the northwest through tonight,
passing over the area on Tuesday.

VFR. NNW-NW winds around around 10 kt will diminish this
evening, veering around to the by NE morning, and eventually SE
Tuesday afternoon.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Winds may vary 10-20 degrees on either side of 320 for the
remainder of this afternoon.

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

Tuesday Afternoon-Thursday: VFR.

Thursday night and Friday: MVFR or lower cond beginning mainly at
night, with rain becoming likely, possibly beginning as a wintry
mix at the onset at or near KSWF.

Friday night: Chance of MVFR/rain in the morning at the eastern
terminals, otherwise mainly VFR. NW winds G15-20kt.

Saturday: VFR. NW winds G20-25kt.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Sub-SCA conditions expected through Wed under influence of high
pressure. ESE ocean swells emanating from large offshore low will
build to SCA levels on the ocean waters Wed Night into Thu AM.

Small Craft Advisory conditions are expected on the ocean waters
Thursday through at least the first half of the weekend, but could
continue into early next week. Seas build to 5 ft early Thursday
with long period southeasterly swells from a storm system well
offshore. Seas reach 7-8 ft by Thursday night and remain elevated
through Friday night. Wind gusts Thursday through early next week
will generally remain below 25 kt. There will, however, be a period
where 25 to 30 kt gusts are possible associated with a frontal
system Friday night through Saturday on all waters.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
