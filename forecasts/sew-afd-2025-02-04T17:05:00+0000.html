Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
905 AM PST Tue Feb 4 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low spinning off the Pacific
coast will continue to bring chances of snow showers to western
Washington for much of the week before pushing inland on Friday.
This will keep temperatures cold as well as allowing gusty Fraser
outflow winds to drag wind chills into the single digits for
northern portions of the area at least through midweek.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Radar remains active over the
Olympic peninsula and just off the coast and with most obs reporting
temps at or just below freezing, safe to say any activity there will
fall in the form of snow. There is an echo down around Hoquiam at
the time of this writing /843 AM PST/ that looks like it might be
generating accumulating snowfall...however it, like all echoes
currently on radar, is moving northward and this motion will limit
any potential accumulation. That said, the Winter Weather Advisory
in place there looks good for now. Will need to monitor temperature
and precip type as the 10 AM expiration approaches, but with most
obs reporting temps at 8 AM already in the 31 to 33 range, the
additional daytime heating expected continues to suggest that no
extension will be needed.

Overall, the pattern is not expected to change too much and model
data has been consistent, thus no expectation that the forecast will
change much either. The upper level low off the coast will continue
to be the main driver for weather in W WA for much of the rest of
the week. That said, while the low is far enough away from the coast
to limit precip throughout the day today, it begins to wobble
eastward tonight, which may allow for the resumption of showery
activity. The main timeframe of concern will be as early as
Wednesday afternoon but likely holding off until Wednesday evening
and into Thursday, where the upper low spins another slug of
moisture up into the area. On the bright side, this will bring
clouds into the area and thus warming overnight lows, however said
lows will still have a difficult time getting to 30 or higher. With
that being the case, any precip from this incoming moisture will
fall as snow. Looking at QPF and expected snow amount forecasts, any
accumulation still looks to remain limited...yet close enough to
lowland thresholds where additional advisories may be needed for
Wednesday night into Thursday. Will evaluate this with incoming 12Z
data for any decisions for the afternoon forecast package. Precip
tapers off by late Thursday morning/early Thursday afternoon as the
shifting low drags moisture to the south of the CWA...thus allowing
for a bit of a break.

Inherited forecast largely in good shape and no need for any morning
updates at this time...with the only exception, as stated above,
being that if conditions persist longer than expected, an extension
of current headlines might be needed.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...From Previous Discussion...The
upper level low will move inland on Friday, allowing for flow aloft
to transition to northwesterly and for conditions to dry somewhat
across western Washington on Friday. However, an embedded shortwave
in the flow aloft could bring another round of light showers to
western Washington Friday night into the weekend. Conditions then
look to remain showery into next week as another low looks to drop
into the region from British Columbia on Monday. While spread in the
temperature forecast remains, temperatures look to remain cool,
below normal through the long term. Highs generally look to trend in
the upper 30s to near 40 and overnight lows look to trend in the
20s. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft as low level flow turns
northerly with an upper level low churning offshore. Conditions at
the terminals have mostly improved to VFR as scattered snow showers
decrease in coverage this morning. Conditions look to improve into
the later half of the day (21z-23z) to low end VFR/MVFR with shower
coverage gradually decreasing across the region, mostly confined to
the Olympic Peninsula for the remainder of the day. Conditions will
trend lower towards MVFR/localized IFR as another round of light
snow showers moves northward Wednesday morning.

KSEA...VFR conditions favored throughout the day today with
potential for MVFR conditions in light snow showers early Wednesday.
Easterly surface winds generally east to northeasterly around 6 to
10 knots. Winds look to become more northerly after 21z while
maintaining the same speeds through the evening. A brief switch to
light southerly winds early Wednesday morning (12z-17z) before
switching back to E/NE 6 to 10 kt Wednesday afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface trough will continue to remain over the
coastal waters with surface ridging in place over British Columbia.
Fraser River outflow winds will continue through Wednesday morning,
where a Small Craft Advisory remains for the Northern Inland waters,
the Central/West Strait of Juan De Fuca, and the adjacent inner
coastal waters. Offshore flow will persist through the end of the
week, with low pressure offshore and higher pressure inland.

Combined seas generally around 3 to 6 feet will continue throughout
the rest of the week.
