Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
344 AM PDT Sat Oct 19 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An atmospheric river will continue to bring moderate
to heavy rainfall and gusty winds to the region into the weekend.
High pressure will resume early next week, providing drier
conditions and relief from the wet conditions for at least a few
days. More rain likely to return late next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Widespread moderate to heavy
rain remains across portions of the region this morning as the
first significant atmospheric river event of the season is
underway. This will bring heavier rain and gusty winds to much of
the area, especially the northern coast and the northern portions
of the interior. Expect winds to peak and gradually ease this
morning, with the wind advisory in effect through early this
morning for these favored locations. Rainfall totals will be
highest across the Olympics and North Cascades (generally 3-5
inches, with locally higher amounts possible). Meanwhile, expect
1-4" over portions of the northern interior, but closer to 0.50-1"
for much of the Seattle area southward through Lewis County. While
river flooding is not expected, some urban/small stream issues
could arise with prolonged periods of steady rainfall.

Steady rainfall comes to an end Sunday night as this band of
moisture shifts to our south. The air mass will be cool and
showery on Monday with a trough. Expect lows in the 40s and highs
in the 50s. Snow levels will drop to around 4,000 ft with light
snow over the higher mountain peaks and passes.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Broad high pressure brings a
period of drier weather as we move through next week. Temperatures
remain on the cool-side with highs in the 50s and lows in the 30s
and 40s. Some areas in the South Sound could see areas of frost in
the morning Wednesday and Thursday. Another frontal system is
likely to aim additional moisture at the region late in the week,
bringing an end to the drier conditions.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A warm front will slow inland over the region this
morning, with a trailing cold front passing through late today into
Sunday. Rain showers continue this morning, primarily over the
northern terminals. Additional rounds of rain are expected later
today (may hinder visibilities at times to 2-5 miles). Most
terminals are reporting ceilings down to MVFR this morning post-rain
(with localized IFR/LIFR stratus). The low ceilings will slowly lift
throughout the day today to MVFR/VFR (best chance of this will be in
and south/east of Puget Sound - although Cascades/Olympics may keep
their low clouds through the entire day). Jet max to the west will
increase west flow aloft. Gusty south winds will continue today,
sustained at 8 to 15 kt with gusts to 25-30 kt before diminishing
late Saturday night.

KSEA...MVFR CIGs (with sporadic IFR clouds at 800 ft AGL) will
continue this morning, and may lift to VFR as early as 21Z Saturday.
Rain showers have ended this morning, but will be possible
throughout the day today (especially this afternoon). Winds will
pick up out of the south (once mixing takes place), gusting up to 20-
25 kt throughout the day today (but sustained around 10 kt). Lower
MVFR CIGs expected Sunday morning.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A warm front continues to produce widespread rain showers
and gusty winds across most waterways this morning. The gale threat
is diminishing this morning, but occasional gusts up to gale force
will continue through this morning through the East Strait of Juan
de Fuca and the Northern Inland Waters. Based on model guidance and
observations, the small craft advisory was extended for the Puget
Sound waters through 3 PM this afternoon. Winds look to be breezy
through the Central Strait of Juan de Fuca as they turn to become
more southeasterly, prompting a Small Craft Advisory through this
evening. For the coastal waters, sustained winds of 20-25 kt will
continue today, with gusts to 30 kt possible. Seas will also remain
high at 10-13 feet at 13 seconds. All winds/seas will drop below
small craft advisory criteria late tonight, with seas ranging from 6
to 8 feet Sunday morning, and winds below 15 kt.

Looking ahead, as high pressure begins to build back over the
coastal waters, a push through the central Strait of Juan de Fuca
late Sunday may bring gusty westerlies. Otherwise no potential
hazard areas exist in the forecast at this time. Seas will drop to 4
to 6 feet Monday and increase back to 6 to 9 feet by next Friday.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The first atmospheric river of the fall season is on
track to bring periods of moderate to heavy rainfall to western
Washington. This will bring sharp rises on area rivers with the
heaviest rainfall focused over the northern coast, Olympic
Peninsula, and North Cascades. Rainfall amounts in these areas
could reach 4 to 6 inches, while the remainder of the Cascades
will see around 2 to 4 inches of rain through the weekend. Despite
the significant incoming rainfall, forecast models continue to
keep river flows below action stage and below minor flood
thresholds throughout the weekend. However, river forecast models
often struggle with the first event of the wet season in terms of
balancing runoff and river flow losses going overbank, so
conditions will continue to be closely monitored.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
