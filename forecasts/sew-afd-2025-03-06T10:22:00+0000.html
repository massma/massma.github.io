Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
222 AM PST Thu Mar 6 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Relatively dry conditions are expected across much of
western Washington through this weekend. The exception will be
across far northwestern Washington as a system glaces the area. A
cool and wet weather pattern may return early next week bringing
lowland rain, snow, and increased winds back to the mountains.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Dry, northerly, flow sets
up over WA today with high pressure centered offshore (near
130W). Clearing skies have allowed temps to dip into the 30s and
lower 40s early this morning with freezing temps around the south
sound. Near the surface, there`s patchy low clouds and fog in the
interior that will burn off through the late morning. Expect
plenty of sun this afternoon with highs in the low to mid 50s.

The ridge shifts inland Friday and Saturday for more dry and mild
weather. The air mass will be a little warmer with highs on
Saturday reaching the upper 50s to lower 60s. Morning lows will
still be chilly and in the 30s. 33

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...The ridge flattens a bit
by Sunday and shifts a little east and farther inland. This now
brings rain to the coast, Olympic peninsula and North Interior as
a weak front tries to shift in. Rain increases toward the evening
for Seattle south as the front slowly pushes farther in. Snow
levels hover around 4,000 ft then drop to around 2,500-3,000 late
Sunday night. The north Cascades may see heavy snow during this
period with around 1-3" at the passes.

We`re under moist onshore flow on Monday with additional showers
and mountain snow. More wet weather is headed our way by Tuesday
with a passing short wave trough. A stronger system approaches the
region toward midweek bringing the potential for windier weather.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Flow aloft is light and variable but will trend more
northerly by the afternoon. Mostly VFR but patchy fog (LIFR) and
MVFR/IFR stratus is developing east of Puget Sound and along river
valleys. Guidance has low clouds spreading westward and recent
satellite is in agreement. Stratus will improve to VFR by 18-19z
today. North winds will increase this afternoon before transitioning
southerly Thursday night. Another round of low clouds and patchy fog
is again possible into early Friday morning.

KSEA...VFR currently but low clouds are developing just east of Lake
Washington. IFR to MVFR conditions are forecast this morning as HREF
probabilities indicate a 70-80% chance of cigs below 3,000 ft
between 12-18z. Cigs will improve by 18-19z with VFR expected for
the remainder of the day. More low clouds are slated to return late
tonight into Friday morning. N surface winds between 5-10 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A SCA remains in effect for high seas through Thursday
evening for the outer coastal waters. Otherwise, high pressure will
maintain calmer marine conditions through Friday. Then, a frontal
system will move over the waters late Friday night into the weekend,
bringing small craft winds to the coastal waters, Strait of Juan de
Fuca, and Northern Interior waters. Seas 8 to 10 ft today,
decreasing to 6 to 8 ft tonight through Friday. Seas will build to
10-14 ft Friday night through the weekend as an active weather
pattern is favored into next week.
