Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
901 AM PDT Mon Sep 30 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Upper level ridging will build over western Washington
today before flattening out and shifting eastward tonight. This will
result in sunny skies and slightly above normal temperatures. A
series of dissipating fronts both Tuesday and Wednesday will bring
an increase in clouds and some chances for showers. Upper level
ridging returns Thursday.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Current satellite imagery
shows some high clouds over Vancouver Island, however much of W WA
remains under mostly clear skies and will remain that way
throughout the day. No significant changes made to the forecast
this evening. The previous discussion can be found below:

Near term models have been in lockstep for some time now with upper
level ridging expected for today, making for sunny skies and mild
temperatures. The ridge responsible for this will shift eastward
throughout the day before flattening out overnight into Tuesday
morning, thanks to an upper level low in the Gulf of Alaska
plodding southeastward. As has been consistently advertised, the
front associated with this feature has a hard time staying
together as it moves through the area starting Tuesday morning.
Ensemble members add detail, showing that for the most part, any
precip from this system will likely be limited to the northern
third of the CWA at the very most. The parent low itself fizzles
out by the time it reaches southern BC...so while this may present
enough moisture to keeps some lingering clouds in the area
Wednesday, will generally see improving conditions with the chance
of showers really only remaining over the Cascades of Whatcom and
Skagit counties.

High temps today and Tuesday will be fairly similar, mostly in the
lower to mid 60s, however locations in the SW interior Tuesday could
see highs nudge right up against 70. Forecast cloud cover will cool
things off for Wednesday with highs in the upper 50s to mid 60s.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Another ridge emerges early
Thursday and will hold court over W WA throughout the day, clearing
skies and bumping high temps that day into the 60s areawide.
However, a new rift in deterministic models is lowering confidence
beyond this point in the forecast. Latest GFS keeps the ridge in
place and keeps things dry into the weekend before a dissipating
front comes knocking Sunday morning. The ECMWF remains consistent
with previous runs, having the ridge shift eastward through the day
Thursday and an upper level trough and associated frontal system
poised to bring a return to precipitation throughout the day
Friday...ridging building in afterward. Ensemble solutions show a
majority siding with the more consistent ECMWF and as such, so does
the current forecast. However, it is apparent that the NBM is
picking up on this disagreement, with PoPs Friday remaining below 50
pct. Following the ECMWF`s train of thought, Saturday and Sunday
should see a return to dry conditions to much of the area, however an
approaching front may allow for some PoPs along the coast Sunday.

Daytime highs will see a little increase during the extended,
generally ranging in the mid 60s to around 70, with some spots in
the SW interior creeping into the lower 70s. Overnight lows do not
see much in the way of variation either, staying in the mid 40s to
around 50.

.AVIATION...West to northwest flow aloft will continue into
tonight as a low amplitude upper ridge builds into the region. The
low level flow will be northerly or weakly offshore. Apart from
patchy morning fog across the Southwest Interior, south Puget Sound,
and outlying river valleys, expecting VFR conditions across Western
Washington today.

KSEA...VFR today. Any patchy fog that forms this morning looks to
remain south and/or west of the terminal. Surface winds N/NE 5 to 10
knots.   27

&&

.MARINE...Thermally induced low pressure expanding northward along
the Oregon coast today will turn the flow weakly offshore at times.
Onshore flow resumes by Tuesday afternoon as a weak front dissipates
over the coastal waters with little to no impact. Some degree of
onshore flow continues Wednesday before the flow turns northerly
once again on Thursday as another surface ridge builds into southern
British Columbia. Hazardous double digit seas are expected to reach
the coastal waters later Tuesday into Wednesday as the result of a
deep surface low passing well north of the area across the Gulf of
Alaska.   27
