Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
820 PM PST Thu Dec 5 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A stronger front is on track to bring more widespread
precipitation this weekend, in the form of snow in the mountains,
and rain at lower elevations. Breezy south to southwest winds are
expected with this front Saturday morning. A brief period of dry
conditions will follow Sunday night into Monday before the active
pattern continues by mid-week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No updates have been made
this evening. The previous discussion will follow, with an update
to the aviation and marine sections.

Clouds will continue to increase tonight into tomorrow as the
next system begins to work its way towards the region from the
northeast Pacific. This system will be supported in the upper
levels with a strong closed low to the north with the jet aimed
towards far northwestern Washington up to Vancouver Island. This
will bring a period of active weather expected through the
weekend.

* RAIN...Rain will begin to fall over the northwest Olympic
  Peninsula Friday night as the warm front moves through the area,
  followed by the cold front sinking southeastward across the
  area overnight Friday into Saturday morning. During this period,
  snow levels will rise up to 7000 to 9000 ft, with most of the
  precipitation falling as rain. The highest rainfall amounts are
  currently expected over the north and central Cascades, with
  probabilities of up to 40-60% chance for seeing at least 3
  inches of rain through portions of the Cascades in Snohomish,
  Skagit, and Whatcom counties. Windward slopes of the Olympics
  and the Pacific Coast may see 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain (in 24
  hr ending Saturday afternoon), with around half an inch possible
  in the lowlands through Saturday afternoon.

* SNOW...Saturday afternoon into Sunday, behind the cold frontal
  passage, substantial rain will devolve into showers and
  mountain-enhanced precipitation. Snow levels will rapidly fall
  to around 3500 to 3000 ft. Accumulating snow is expected through
  the passes, with 50-70% probabilities of seeing at least 8 in of
  snow through Stevens and Snoqualmie passes (in 24 hr ending
  Sunday afternoon). With only 10-30% chances of seeing at least 12
  in of snow, a winter storm watch will not be issued with this
  forecast package, though will continue to monitor for trends in
  the snow level and QPF forecasts.

* WIND...Additionally, southerly winds will increase ahead of the
  cold front late Friday into early Saturday, then with
  southwesterly winds increasing behind the front Saturday
  afternoon into early Sunday. Wind speeds continue to be forecast
  below advisory criteria.

* HIGH SURF...Large waves are expected to build along the
  coastline during the day on Sunday will allow for high surf
  conditions to develop along the Pacific coast, including the
  threat for large breaking waves and coastal erosion.

Rain and mountain snow will taper off Sunday night as the surface
low pressure system and associated upper level trough exits the
region.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The upper level ridge will
move through Monday with the ridge axis moving through Tuesday.
The remainder of the long term forecast remains fairly uncertain,
as the evolution depends on the breadth and amplitude of the
ridge, as well as how quickly the ridge departs. Many model
ensemble members as well as the operational deterministic models
have additional frontal systems tracking through the area by mid
week, particularly Wednesday into Thursday. A wide range of
solutions exist for the evolution of this system, with the
potential for more impactful weather mid to late week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mostly VFR conditions across most of the terminals.
Current radar shows some very light showers moving through Western
Washington, however they are quickly fleeting. VFR conditions
should continue into tonight for most of the terminals and start
to gradually start to lower into Friday morning trending towards
MVFR. A chance of patchy fog is possible tonight into Friday
night. The fog will be limited to the Kitsap Peninsula and
southern interior, possibly bringing conditions down to IFR/LIFR.
Ceilings appear to eventually lift and show some improvement in
after 21Z as high clouds settle in the region ahead of a weather
system.

KSEA...Currently VFR conditions at the terminal. Ceilings will
gradually lower tonight into Friday, with a 30% chance of ceilings
becoming MVFR through 17z. Guidance hints at the ceilings rising
again to VFR conditions shortly after 18Z. Southerly flow will
persist throughout the day and light rain is looking to be
possible as early as 00Z on Friday afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong frontal system remains on track to move into the
waters Friday into the weekend, bringing more widespread advisory
strength winds to the coastal waters and portions of the inland
waters, including Admiralty Inlet, the eastern Strait of Juan de
Fuca, and the Northern Inland Waters. Ahead of the front, strong
southerly flow will lead to steep waves along the coastal waters
of Washington. These waves will be around 7-9 ft with a period of
5-7 seconds on Friday. As the frontal system moves over the
waters, southerly flow will become westerly early Saturday
morning, which will allow the waves to build into late Saturday
night and Sunday. Waves in the coastal waters will be around 15-20
ft. Waves will gradually begin to subside on Monday back to 6-8
ft as winds high pressure builds over the waters early next week
bringing lighter winds. Additional disturbances look to approach
the coastal waters near midweek.

MGF<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...A shift to a more active pattern will bring a much
stronger weather system across portions of Western Washington. This
will bring widespread precipitation, as well as snow levels climbing
to around 7000 to 9000 feet during the bulk of the heavier rain on
Saturday. This, combined with the heavier rainfall, will result in
rises on rivers across the region. While the precipitation forecast
continues to fluctuate a bit run-to-run, 2 to 3 inches of rainfall
appear most likely. However, high end potential amounts would reach
into the 4 to 5 inch range across portions of the Olympics and the
northern and central Cascades. As a result, a flood potential
outlook (ESF) remains in effect for Whatcom, Skagit, Snohomish, and
Mason counties. These areas see the greatest threat of river
flooding during the late Saturday and Sunday time period. Other area
rivers will continue to be monitored for flood potential. A brief
period of drier conditions will allow for rivers to recede early
next week, but another round of hydrologically significant
precipitation may follow later next week.
