Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
840 AM PST Fri Nov 29 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Upper level ridging over the region will weaken enough
today to allow a weak disturbance to produce a couple showers
across coastal areas and the North Interior. The ridge will
strengthen over the weekend into early next week for dry
conditions and widespread night and morning fog. The ridge will
weaken enough during the second half of next week to allow for a
returning chance of precipitation across the area.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The current forecast remains
on track with no planned updates this morning. 33

Previous discussion...A weak disturbance passing across the area
this morning is producing enough cloud cover to limit fog
development somewhat north of Seattle. Most areas will remain dry
today, but a couple of showers will be possible along the coast
and near the Canadian border. High temperatures will remain on the
cool side...a few degrees below seasonal averages. Upper level
ridging begins to rebuild across the region tonight into Saturday
and remains in place through the weekend. Light surface gradients
and remnant low level moisture will likely allow nightly fog and
low cloud coverage to expand with time. This will keep low
temperatures across the lowlands mostly above freezing, but will
also keep daytime highs below normal.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Upper level ridging is
expected to remain in control through the first half of the coming
week for dry conditions and near normal temperatures. A couple of
disturbances riding over the top of the ridge may produce some
clouds, but precip chances look to remain mainly north of the
area. As we approach the second half of the week, some
deterministic model runs are advertising a weakening of the ridge
and begin to introduce some precip chances. However, it should be
noted that ensembles are generally in agreement with maintaining
a mean ridge position along the West Coast throughout the whole of
next week. So, it wouldn`t be surprising to see the PoPs presently
in days 6/7 of the default NBM forecast begin to get cut back as
we get closer to the middle of next week. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridging will keep flow aloft northwesterly
into the weekend. Surface winds are light and variable and this is
expected to persist at least into Friday morning before most
terminals return to southerly winds Friday afternoon...although
speeds will generally remain 5 kts or less.

Cigs have begun to improve to MVFR for most areas (intermittent IFR
is possible through late morning as clouds rise and mix with moist
air a little bit). Lower visibilities due to mist continues in most
of Snohomish County and Kitsap County, but these are improving
rapidly as well this morning. With the south winds helping to clear
things up, conditions will improve to VFR/MVFR across the region
late this morning and afternoon. Surface winds during this time will
continue to be light. Given the persistent pattern of having the
upper level ridge in place, fog will likely settle in once again
tonight for most inland terminals, generally after 06Z. The fog is
not likely to impact terminals along the Strait of Juan de Fuca and
the coast.

KSEA...Fog has cleared, and continues to lift this morning with
ceilings between 800 and 1,200 feet as of writing. Visibility has
also improved to 6 miles with mist. Cigs will lift to around 2000 ft
by 20Z, then there will be a window of VFR cigs thereafter until the
fog settles in again after 06Z. Surface winds today will be light
and out of the SSE.

.MARINE...High pressure will continue over the waters into the
weekend. Fog that has established itself throughout Puget Sound will
linger through the morning hours, limiting visibilities over the
central and southern portions of the Sound more. Winds will be light
through the weekend at or less than 5 kt from the southwest, with
wave heights of 3 to 5 feet building to 4 to 6 feet Sunday. A
potential disturbance early next week will bring seas up to 6 to 8
feet Sunday into Monday, but winds at this time are expected to
remain below 15 kt over the coastal waters.
