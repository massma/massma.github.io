Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
414 AM PST Wed Dec 25 2024

.SYNOPSIS... <span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Rain out ahead of a strong system spreading over the
area today and tonight with high winds along the coast late
tonight and possible high winds over the Northwest Interior. Bent
back occlusion moving through Thursday keeping the threat of high
winds going for the coast and Northwest Interior in the morning
hours with windy conditions elsewhere. A weaker system will reach
the area Friday. Additional systems will arrive Friday night into
Saturday and Sunday. Could see a small break the first part of
next week before another series of front takes aim at Western
Washington midweek.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
mostly cloudy skies over Western Washington early this morning.
Doppler radar picking up a few showers along the coast with
the leading edge of the rain out ahead of the next system about
100 miles offshore. A little break in the cloud coverage last
night allowed temperatures to drop into the mid 30s to mid 40s by
3 am/11z. With the increasing cloud cover temperatures will not
drop much further the remainder of the morning.

Active weather pattern setting up for Western Washington today and
tomorrow. Rain out ahead of the approaching frontal system
spreading over Western Washington later this morning with the
precipitation making it to the Cascades by midday. Rain continuing
through the afternoon hours. Southeasterly surface gradients
increasing as the front approaches the coast with a wind advisory
already in place for the North Coast and Northwest Interior
including Admiralty Inlet for southeast winds increasing to 20 to
30 mph with gusts as high as 50 mph later today. As the front
gets closer to the coast tonight southeast winds along the coast
increasing to 25 to 40 mph with possible gusts as high as 60 mph.
The high wind watch for the coast has been upgraded to a high wind
warning beginning at 10- pm tonight. This system is juicy with
IVT values around 1000 kg m-1 s-1 making it a moderate to strong
atmospheric river. Western Washington not getting a direct hit
from the strongest portion of the system moisture with the highest
IVT values moving inland south of the area but we are still close
enough to get a good amount of precipitation from this system
through early Thursday morning. Snow levels with range between
2500 to 3500 feet initially and will only rise slightly later
today into tonight. Orographics not great in the beginning with
southerly winds at 850 mb but as the 850 mb winds turn more
southwesterly tonight snow amounts will increase over the Olympics
and Cascades. The volcanoes will be the big winners as far as new
sn ow with both Mount Baker and Mount Rainier getting as much as
18 inches of new snow just tonight. The winter storm warning will
continue for the mountains through tonight. Highs mid and upper
40s. Lows tonight in the lower to mid 40s.

First wave moving through early Thursday morning with a bent back
occlusion developing behind the wave early. Models still having a
bit of difficultly zeroing in on the track of this feature. The
model trends the last couple of runs have weakened the bent back a
little but not enough to eliminate high winds along the coast
Thursday morning and the potential for high winds over the
Northwest Interior as well Thursday morning. Along the coast there
will be a quick switch from southeast winds with the front to
strong westerlies, 25 to 40 mph with gusts as high as 60 mph,
with the bent back feature in the 12z-15z time frame. The track of
the bent back feature will be critical for how much wind the
interior gets Thursday morning. Latest model runs have tracked
the feature a little further north but still show a rapid
increase in the surface gradients. The Olympia to Bellingham
gradient goes from 1 mb to near 8 mb on the GFS between 12z and
18z Thursday. Wind advisories are certainly possible for the
remainder of the lowlands not under a watch or warning Thursday
morning. As the bent back moves off to the northeast winds will
ease all areas Thursday afternoon. Snow continuing in the
mountains with snow levels near 3500 feet. Highs Thursday near 50.
The combination of elevated seas, high winds and lower pressure
could produce some minor coastal flooding along the coast around
high tide Thursday morning both along the coast and over the
Northwest Interior.

Short break in the action Thursday evening as the next system
becomes more negatively tilted. This will slow the eastward
progress with the rain not picking back up again until after
midnight. This system has two low centers associated with it. One
will remain well offshore while the other moves towards the North
Oregon coast. Not expecting nearly as much wind with this feature
with the one low center to the south of the area.

Front moving through Friday for another wet day. Snow levels will
still be around 3500 feet making for winter driving conditions in
the higher passes.

The high wind watch for the coast for tonight into Thursday has
been upgraded to a high wind warning. Will update the winter
storm warning increasing the new snow totals. It is possible Mount
baker and Mount Rainer could see 3 feet of new snow by Thursday
night.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement with a pair of systems moving through Western
Washington over the weekend and a weak system reaching the area
Monday. Models indicating another possible atmospheric river
developing for later Tuesday into Wednesday keeping the wet
weather pattern intact for Western Washington. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft early this morning will transition
more southwesterly by late morning as an upper trough approaches W
WA. Southerly surface winds will see speeds increase to 10-15 kts by
late morning with more wind prone locations such as HQM or BLI
seeing speeds increase further into the 15-20 kt range. Gusts up to
30 kts will be possible for all terminals in the afternoon and for
the remainder of the TAF period.

Generally VFR to MVFR conditions this early morning, with MVFR
present in and around the San Juans and in the Chehalis River
valley. Isolated IFR conditions present at PWT and SHN. Remaining
terminals VFR. Some question as to whether MVFR locations will see
cigs recover, as latest guidance suggests current TAFs might be a
little on the optimistic side. Will likely need to alter trends for
BLI and OLM to reflect this newfound pessimism. This also impacts
current IFR locations /PWT/, with similar adjustments needed. For
remaining terminals, cigs gradually degrade as incoming system
approaches. Widespread MVFR to IFR conditions expected as rain and
winds move in with the front this afternoon and will remain that way
for the rest of the TAF period.

KSEA...VFR conditions in place with mid and high level clouds
present. Will see cigs lower in the late morning and early afternoon
before conditions dip down into MVFR as steady rainfall moves in by
21Z. Precipitation will likely result in some vis restrictions. As
stated above, gusty southerly winds to around 20 kt expected in the
afternoon before stronger gusts up to 30 kt are likely this evening
and tonight.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Winds will increase throughout the day today as the next
frontal system moves across Western Washington. High-end gales are
expected for the coastal waters, as well as portions of the Strait
of Juan de Fuca and Northern Inland Waters this afternoon and
tonight. There is the potential for a brief burst of storm gusts to
60 kt with the frontal passage around midday over the outer coastal
waters, but at this time, confidence still is not there that these
gusts will be frequent enough for the next higher level warning
/Storm Warning/. As such, will continue to monitor high resolution
guidance and available observations, with the expectation that
additional headlines or upgrades may yet be needed.

Another system will quickly follow later Wednesday night into
Thursday morning as some guidance suggests a deepening low will
cross the northern coastal waters and toward the west entrance of
the Strait of Juan de Fuca. While there does remain some uncertainty
as to if it develops fully, how strong it will be, and where it
might track, the potential for another round of very strong winds
(at least gales, with high end potential of 60 kt gusts in a bent-
back occlusion around the low) needs to be emphasized. Inherited
Gales cover this event for now. Yet another weather system expected
for Friday into Saturday, bringing an additional period of stronger
winds.

Seas remain elevated, holding around 15 feet this early morning.
While they may ease a little bit more, they are expected to build
again into the 20-25 ft range over the coastal waters by Thursday.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A series of systems will move through Western
Washington through the weekend. The most hydrologically
significant system will be the atmospheric river today through
Thursday. Three to five inches of precipitation over the Olympics
expected during this timeframe. This will push the Skokomish into
moderate flood stage ( the river is only a tenth of a foot below
flood stage early this morning ) Thursday. The Bogachiel and
Satsop will also be under pressure in this scenario with flooding
possible on the Bogachiel Thursday.

While precipitation will be less with the systems beginning Friday
the lack of much of a break will keep rivers over the Southwest
Interior rising into the weekend. It`s possible the lower reaches
of the Chehalis could flood late Friday into Saturday. The
Skookumchuck near Bucoda and the Newaukum near Chehalis could reach
action stage Friday.

Rivers across the remainder of the area will also be on the rise
in the next few days but the combination of a little less
precipitation and a little cooler temperatures in the Cascades
will reduce the flood threat for rivers flowing off the Cascades.

With all of the precipitation the landslide threat will continue
to increase into the weekend. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
