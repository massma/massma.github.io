Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
250 PM PDT Wed Aug 7 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Temperatures will warm to well above normal Thursday
and Friday before cooling takes place over the weekend. Areas of
lofted smoke and haze are expected beginning Thursday and by
Friday there will be a chance of isolated mountain thunderstorms,
primarily in the Cascades. Cooling conditions will arrive this
weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Widespread stratus burned
off quickly today. Outside of some mountain cumulus, mostly clear
skies are in place. Temperatures today will top out in the upper
70s to low 80s across the lowlands. Temperatures will warm 5-10
degrees on Thursday across western Washington. Thursday will also
see the arrival of lofted smoke/haze from fires in eastern
Washington as mid-level flow becomes offshore. At this time the
majority of smoke is still expected to be elevated from the
surface. In any case, this smoke/haze makes the temperature
forecast for Thursday and Thursday night complex. Daytime smoke
could result in temperature slightly lower than currently in the
official forecast, while overnight smoke could keep temperatures
up slightly. The current forecast has widespread moderate/orange
levels of HeatRisk with isolated areas of major/red HeatRisk in
favored areas such as urban heat islands and the mountain valleys.
There will also be a slight chance of a shower/thunderstorm over
the far northern Cascades Thursday.

By Friday, weak onshore flow will provide a little relief to the
coast and southwest interior, but other places in western WA will
see temperatures (and HeatRisk) similar to those on Thursday. A
Heat Advisory has been issued for portions of western Washington
for Thursday and Friday. Friday will also see an increased chance
for mountain thunderstorms - roughly a 20-30% chance in the
Cascades and a 10-20% chance in the Olympics.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Onshore flow and weak
toughing will increase over the weekend, bringing cooling
temperatures back to the region. This transition should also aid
in scouring out any smoke/haze that remains in the area.
Thunderstorm chances become limited again to the North Cascades
(probability 10-20%).

Looking out further, troughing and much more pleasant temperatures
are expected next week (generally in the 70s across the lowlands)
as well as mostly dry conditions.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Flow aloft is west-northwesterly with an upper level
high situated over the Northwest Territories and an upper level low
situated over Manitoba. Marine stratus has retreated back to the
coast this afternoon rendering widespread VFR conditions to the
area terminals. Expect conditions to remain VFR through tonight,
before another round of stratus starts to move inland overnight
into Thursday morning. Latest guidance brings stratus into portions
of the southern interior and down the Strait of Juan de Fuca, but
generally keeps it west of the majority of the interior terminals
of the Sound at this time. Expect stratus to be shallow and to
scatter by 18Z. Haze from smoke aloft looks to move over the region
Thursday afternoon.

KSEA...VFR conditions to continue through tonight. Northerly surface
winds, generally persisting between 7-12 kt through tonight. Winds
will decrease and become light again overnight, increasing to
7-12 kt again during the afternoon hours on Thursday. Haze will
be present Thursday afternoon. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Broad surface high pressure will remain offshore and
will interact with lower pressure inland through much of the
week. Generally benign conditions are expected for the area waters
tonight into Thursday. Onshore flow will increase on Friday and
looks to bring a round of small craft strength westerly winds to
the central and eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca Friday afternoon
and evening. Additional rounds of diurnal westerly pushes will be
possible through the Strait over the weekend.

Persistent northwest winds will continue over the outer coastal
waters, maintaining steep seas generally around 4 to 6 feet for
the next few days. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridging will begin to build into the
area starting today bringing warmer temperatures and drier
conditions through the rest of the week. Weak offshore flow is
possible in the Cascade valleys this afternoon through Friday
bringing isolated areas of lower RHs. At this time, conditions do
not appear widespread enough to for a Red Flag Warning.

Instability will increase Thursday afternoon as a weak
disturbance clips the Canadian border, which may trigger some
isolated thunderstorm development along the North Cascades. The
particular area we are monitoring is mainly the northern portion
of zone 658 near the Canadian border. Thunderstorm probabilities
increase somewhat on Friday afternoon over the Cascades (20-30%)
and perhaps even the Olympics (10-20%). With a lower potential on
Saturday. This threat of convection will continued to be monitored
given the potential for lightning strikes to spark new fires.
