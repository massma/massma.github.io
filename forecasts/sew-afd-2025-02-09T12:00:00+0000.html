Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
400 AM PST Sun Feb 9 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak upper level trough remaining over the area today.
A stronger trough coming down from the north will move through
Monday. With the over land track of this feature there will not
be much moisture with it. Dry northerly flow aloft Tuesday and
Wednesday with a narrow high amplitude upper level ridge off the
coast. Weather system cutting underneath the ridge could move into
Western Washington Thursday or Friday. A more organized system
will arrive next weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
cloudy skies over Western Washington. Doppler radar has scattered
mostly rain showers over the interior and along the Central and
South Coast. Temperatures at 3 am/11z were in the upper 20s to mid
30s.

Weak upper level trofiness continuing over the area today keeping
showers in the forecast mainly for the interior. The air mass has
moderated slightly to the point where most of the showers are in
the form of rain. Dew points for the most part are above freezing
so it is going to take a heavier shower to drive the snow level
briefly down to the surface this morning. Looking at observations
around the area and upper level cross sections it looks like the
snow level is close to 500 feet over the Puget Sound area and a
little lower elsewhere. Shower activity decreasing this afternoon
combined with a slightly warmer air mass will make what shower
activity is left be in the form of rain in the lowlands. Another
cool day with highs near 40.

Shower activity looks to be over by this evening. Plenty of low
level moisture around plus light conditions in the lower levels
will keep cloud cover over most of the area. Drier air moving into
the extreme northern sections will help skies clear over Whatcom
county and along the north coast. Lows tonight in the mid 20s to
lower 30s.

Another upper level trough swinging into the area Monday. This
feature will move down from the north with the trough axis near
the Canadian border by 00z Tuesday. With the over land track this
feature will not have much moisture with it. The most impactful
weather MOnday will be the refreezing of the surface moisture
tonight into Monday morning with lows below freezing. This could
make for some icy roads for the Monday morning commute,
especially the ones less traveled. Patchy freezing fog also early
in the morning in the fog prone places like the Southwest
Interior. Skies clearing out during the day but with the cool
northerly flow aloft even with sunshine highs again only near 40.

Mostly clear skies Monday night with the upper level trough moving
through and the high amplitude but narrow upper level ridge
offshore. Northerly flow aloft over the area. The lack of cloud
cover and light flow in the lower levels overnight will allow
temperatures to drop at least into the 20s early Tuesday morning.
Some of the colder locations could get into the upper teens. The
record low for Seattle is 23 degrees set way back in 1948. Current
forecast going for 24 degrees.

Sunny day in store for Tuesday with the upper level ridge
remaining in place and dry northerly flow aloft. With the cold
overnight low temperatures highs will only recover into the mid
30s to lower 40s.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Models in good agreement
for Wednesday with little change in the pattern. Another cold
morning with lows in the teens to mid 20s. Record low for Seattle
21 degrees set in 1949 ( forecast is for 23 degrees ). Models in
better general agreement Thursday and Friday with both models
going for the negatively tilted front trying to get into Western
Washington from the southwest. Still plenty of timing issues along
with the question of how far north the front will get. An
additional up in the air variable is how warm the air mass be when
and if the system arrives. All this adds up to a broadbrush
chance of rain or snow forecast Thursday night into Friday. Better
agreement on the flow aloft becoming westerly Saturday with a
more organized front arriving over the weekend. With the westerly
flow aloft the air mass will moderate enough for the precipitation
type to be rain. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest flow aloft continues over Western
Washington with weak upper ridge offshore and broad upper trough
over the Western U.S. The low level flow is light and will become
northerly later today as surface ridge expands over interior British
Columbia. The air mass is moist with remnant convergence showers
over Puget Sound producing MVFR ceilings and pockets of IFR. Shower
activity will dissipate today and the air mass will gradually dry
out with VFR expected across much of the region by mid-afternoon.

KSEA...MVFR and tempo IFR ceilings to persist this morning
with remnant showers dissipating. Ceilings are expected to
gradually lift to predominantly VFR by 20Z-22Z. Surface winds
light and variable this morning becoming northerly 4 to 7 knots this
afternoon.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak surface trough over the coastal waters will
dissipate this morning. Surface ridging over the interior of
British Columbia will strengthen tonight into Monday turning the
flow northerly or weakly offshore. Some modest Fraser River outflow
is expected to develop on Monday across the Northern Inland Waters.
This general pattern will then persist into Tuesday. An approaching
surface trough over the Oregon offshore waters will turn the flow
increasingly offshore toward midweek. A return of more active
weather is expected by the end of the week.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
