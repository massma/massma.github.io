Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
349 AM PDT Sat Oct 26 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Gusty winds and widespread rain will begin to taper off
this morning, with scattered showers persisting throughout the day.
A second system will bring more widespread rain and breezy
conditions again Saturday Night into Sunday. Unstable conditions
will allow for a chance of thunderstorms during the day and snow
levels will fall low enough for mountain snow. A brief break is
possible late Monday and part of Tuesday before another system looks
to bring another round of rain and mountain snow mid-week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Radar imagery shows widespread
rain across western Washington this morning associated with a low
pressure system centered just offshore, tracking northwestward
towards Vancouver Island. This system is being supported in the
upper levels by a shortwave impulse rotating around a large closed
low centered over the Gulf of Alaska. South to southeasterly winds
will remain gusty this morning, with sustained winds 20 to 30 mph
with gusts up to 45 to 55 mph along the Pacific Coast and areas
around Whidbey Island northward through the San Juan Islands,
including western Whatcom and Skagit counties. Elsewhere, winds look
to top out to 15 to 20 mph with gusts 25 to 30 kt. Winds will back
off later this morning as the surface trough moves through the area.
Additionally, widespread rain will devolve into scattered showers.
Temperatures are currently quite mild across the area, with
temperatures ranging from the upper 40s to near 60. Temperatures
should largely remain steady through most of the day, with high
temperatures around 60.

Another cold front will pass through the area overnight tonight into
Sunday for another round of substantial rainfall and somewhat
breezy winds. Winds look to be weaker compared to this morning as
the parent low center remains well to the north near Haida Gwaii.
The airmass will be unstable with upper-level support, allowing for
the potential for scattered thunderstorm development. Chances will
be best over the coastal waters and on the Pacific Coast. Lightning
and perhaps some small graupel/hail will be the main impacts from
thunderstorms that develop. Snow levels will be high initially, but
will lower to around 4500-5000 ft on Sunday. Chances for showers
continue throughout the day on Sunday and into Monday as the surface
low tracks south towards the region and the associated upper-level
trough digs southeastward into the area. With this, the airmass will
slowly cool, allowing snow levels to continue to slowly lower,
reaching 3500-4000 ft by Monday. This will allow for some light snow
showers and a few inches of accumulating snow at the higher passes
(including White Pass and Washington Pass). Accumulations are
currently appear minimal below 4000 ft through Monday.

Through Monday, from 0.75 to 1.25 inches of rain is expected through
the interior, 2 to 2.5 inches along the Pacific Coast, and 2.5 to 4
inches expected through the mountains, with amounts highest in the
North Cascades and the windward side of the Olympics. Locally higher
amounts are possible.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...A transient ridge will allow
conditions to dry out a bit Tuesday morning before the next system
will approach the region Wednesday into Thursday. Snow levels look
to be lower with this system (2500-3000 ft), allowing for the
potential for more significant accumulating snow at the mountain
passes. Specifics on precipitation amounts at this time are
uncertain as there are discrepancies on the evolution of the system.
With continued upper-level troughing, temperatures look to remain on
the cooler side, with highs in the lower 50s and lows in the upper
30s to lower 40s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow aloft will persist through the TAF
period as a deep upper level low sinks southward over the NE
Pacific. At the surface, a low moving Vancouver Island is
responsible for sweeping a frontal system across western WA.
Winds have become gusty overnight, especially for terminals along
the coast (KHQM) and for terminals across the northern interior
(KBLI). Winds will gradually ease through the morning hours, but
will increase again late this afternoon and evening ahead of the
next approaching frontal system. Conditions will generally remain
VFR to MVFR across the region through much of the day, but could
see some conditions drop to IFR at times in any heavier rain
moving through. Scattered showers will continue through much of
the day, before another round of more widespread rain moves inland
tonight.

KSEA...VFR conditions with gusty southerly winds to 25-30 kt this
morning. Winds will ease over the next few hours. Expect conditions
to primarily trend VFR through the day, with scattered showers
possible at the terminal at times. Winds will increase again
during the evening hours, generally persisting from the south at
10-15 kt, with gusts to 25 kt possible at times.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface low moving into Vancouver Island this morning
is sweeping a strong front across the area waters. Strong
southerly winds will continue to ease over the next few hours,
however expect an uptick in winds across the coastal waters and
north interior waters again this afternoon and evening ahead of
the next frontal system on Sunday. Seas this morning have climbed
significantly over the coastal waters, with latest observations
reporting seas ranging between 15-19 ft. Seas will gradually
subside to 9-11 ft again by this evening, but expect seas to rise
significantly again on Sunday, most likely approaching 15-18 ft
across the outer waters. With winds continuing to ease but with
seas remaining elevated, will allow for gale warnings across the
coastal waters to transition to small craft advisories early this
morning.

The front on Sunday will likely bring another round of breezy
winds for the coast and north interior waters. The pattern will
remain active heading into next week as a strong offshore low
sinks southward into the region Monday, before moving inland over
Oregon Monday night into Tuesday. High pressure then looks to
briefly build back into the waters on Tuesday, before another
frontal system approaches the region on Wednesday.

Seas will remain elevated above 10 ft through Monday, before
falling to 8-10 ft by early Tuesday. Seas then look to build
towards 12-15 ft again Wednesday into Thursday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Several systems will track across western Washington,
with periods of showers with several frontal passages early this
morning, and again on Sunday, as well as another system mid-week.
Snow levels will start high today (7000-9000 ft), lowering from 5000
ft early Sunday to below 4000 ft on Monday. With 2 to 4 inches of
rain in the forecast across the Olympic and Cascade mountains,
significant rises are expected on area rivers. Currently no rivers
are forecasted to reach flood stage, but rivers will need to be
monitored, in particular the Skokomish, which is forecasted to reach
Action stage on Monday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
