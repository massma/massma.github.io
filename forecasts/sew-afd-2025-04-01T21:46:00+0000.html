Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
246 PM PDT Tue Apr 1 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A broad trough will remain over the area into midweek
for a chance of showers. High pressure aloft will build into the
region toward the end of the week for dry conditions and temperatures
trending well above normal by the weekend. A weak front will
approach the region early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure has moved
inland today with onshore flow increasing across western WA. The
result is more clouds and cooler temps across the region with
highs (so far) in the upper 40s to lower 50s. Winds have been
gusting through the strait and there`s a convergence zone forming
over Snohomish County this afternoon. The convergence zone will
sway between King and Snohomish tonight with showers mainly
impacting the central Cascades. Snow level will hover around 3500
ft with a rain/snow mix at Snoqualmie Pass and light snow (up to
3") at Stevens.

A broad trough over the West will keep the forecast cool and
showery moving into Wednesday. Morning lows will be chilly and in
the mid 30s around the south sound, with low 40s elsewhere. Expect
highs around 50 for most spots. Snow levels remain low (around
2500-3000 ft) with a few more inches of snow in the mountains and
passes.

We`re under drier, N flow, on Thursday as high pressure builds
offshore. Weak ripples in the flow will keep a chance of showers
in the forecast, particularly in the Cascades, although total
amounts will be light. Morning lows will be chilly again and in
the 30s for most locations. Highs will be a little warmer and in
the mid 50s.

The ridge will nudge inland on Friday for dry and warmer
conditions. Expect highs in the 60s with plenty of sun. 33

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...High pressure keeps the
region warm and dry moving into the weekend. Temperatures will
reach the 60s to lower 70s both Saturday and Sunday. Rain returns
late Sunday night and Monday as high pressure shifts farther
inland and a weak front moves in from the west. A trough brings
more wet and locally windy weather on Tuesday with overall cooler
conditions. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light northerly to variable flow aloft as broad
troughing starts to gradually move eastward, allowing for
offshore ridging to get close to the Pacific Northwest. A mixed
bag of conditions out there this afternoon as lingering showers
persist across the region. A weak convergence zone will continue
to keep showers along the Cascades and possibly around KPAE and
Central Puget Sound into tonight. MVFR to low end VFR will likely
continue throughout the evening hours for most terminals and
perhaps into Wednesday morning as showers lower conditions here
and there.

KSEA...VFR/MVFR conditions this afternoon as showers drift in and
out of the terminal. Latest guidance continues to indicate a
convergence zone developing around 03z-06z, which could continue
to provide more shower activity and lowered ceilings (30% of
MVFR) into Wednesday morning. S/SW winds generally around 5 to 10
knots, remaining the same direction and strength through
Wednesday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Increasing onshore flow in a wake of a surface low to
out south will bring small craft westerlies through the Central
and Eastern Entrance of the Strait this afternoon. Surface high
pressure will begin to build offshore expanding through our
coastal waters at the end of the week and into the weekend with
benign marine conditions expected.

Combined seas generally around 7 to 9 feet through Wednesday.
Seas will noticeably decrease to around 3 to 5 feet through the
end of the week and into the weekend.
