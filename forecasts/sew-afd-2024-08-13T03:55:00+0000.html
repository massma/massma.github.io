Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
855 PM PDT Mon Aug 12 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Upper troughing over the region will promote onshore
flow and cooler temperatures through Tuesday. Isolated
thunderstorms will be possible across the North Cascades today and
Tuesday. Brief ridging will build Wednesday into Thursday. An
upper low offshore may bring more widespread precipitation
potential over the weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Overall forecast remains
largely on track this evening, so no updates are needed. The
thunderstorm threat will continue to wane across the North
Cascades tonight and stratus will continue to push inland
overnight. Expect stratus to lift, but to stick around on Tuesday.
The remainder of the previous discussion follows below, with
updates made to the aviation and marine sections. 14

Troughing will continue through Tuesday, allowing for continued
cooler conditions. High temperatures Tuesday will be in the mid
60s to low 70s.

Ridging will build briefly into British Columbia Wednesday into
Thursday. This will allow for some additional clearing, especially
Wednesday afternoon. Temperatures will also warm a bit Wednesday
and Thursday, but remain below normal, with highs generally in the
mid 70s for the interior and mid 60s for the coast.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Ensembles are consistent in
troughing developing offshore Friday with an upper low lingering
offshore of Washington/Oregon into early next week. Initially,
precipitation potential will generally be confined to the
Cascades on Friday, along with the threat for thunderstorms in
this area. Increasing moisture is expected Saturday and Sunday
with the upper low position and southerly flow aloft, introducing
more widespread shower chances over Western Washington. We will
also have to monitor the potential for convection, particularly
later Saturday into Sunday morning, given the increasing southerly
flow aloft. NBM probabilities at this time for much of Western
Washington are around 15% for thunderstorms during this period.
Showers chances may lingering into Monday with the upper low
offshore. Temperatures will likely remain below normal, mostly in
the mid 60s to mid 70s over the weekend.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light and variable flow aloft with an upper level trough
moving over western Washington. Surface winds generally remaining
out of the west to southwest for the TAF period with speeds mostly
ranging 5 to 10 kts.

VFR conditions in place throughout W WA, save for some locations on
the coast. However, cigs are expected to erode tonight with
widespread MVFR to IFR conditions returning by early Tuesday
morning. Timing on when cigs will lift and eventually return to VFR
conditions expected to be similar to the past couple of
days...mainly occuring in the early afternoon hours. Like today,
there is no expectation for conditions to actually clear out, but
instead skies remaining mostly cloudy...but with higher cloud bases.

KSEA...VFR conditions through this evening, dropping back down to
MVFR early tomorrow morning after 12Z then lifting back up around
18Z Tuesday. Winds continue to remain southwesterly 5 to 10 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Broad high pressure over the East Pacific will continue
onshore flow over the area waters. Diurnally driven pushes down the
Strait of Juan de Fuca will occur each evening with no signs of SCA
level winds for the next few days. Marine stratus and fog each
morning may locally limit visibility at times. The push Thursday
afternoon looks to be the strongest of the week and may get close to
SCA criteria. Seas will remain around 3 to 5 ft through the rest of
the week.
