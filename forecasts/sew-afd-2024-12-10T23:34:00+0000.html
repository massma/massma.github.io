Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will maintain drier conditions across
western Washington into Wednesday. Rain chances increase Wednesday
night into Thursday as a weak disturbance moves through the area.
Another stronger system will move into the region Friday into the
weekend, bringing the potential for gusty winds, lowland rain, and
mountain snow. An active weather pattern will continue into early
next week as additional disturbances move across the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will keep
conditions dry across western Washington tonight and through much
of the day Wednesday. A few areas of patchy fog will be possible
across the southern Sound again Wednesday morning, but do not
expect extent of fog to be widespread as more mid to high level
cloud cover continues to stream in overhead. Morning lows on
Wednesday will be in the in the mid to upper 30s and afternoon
high temperatures will be in the upper 40s to low 50s.

A weak system will then move across the region Wednesday night
into Thursday, bringing the next round of lowland rain and
mountain snow to western Washington. With most of the energy still
looking to move into northern California, expect overall
precipitation totals to remain rather light. With snow levels
generally hovering between 2500-3500 feet, expect snow
accumulations of 1-3 inches to be possible for the Cascade
passes.

Another, stronger system looks to approach the region Friday
night into Saturday. While there still remains some discrepancy
regarding the track of this low pressure system, this will bring
the potential for gusty winds, lowland rain, and more substantial
mountain snow.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The aforementioned system
will move into the region on Saturday, with winds looking to
increase late Friday into Saturday morning. At this time, NBM
probabilities are indicating roughly a 20-30 percent of wind
gusts of 40 mph or greater along the coast and for areas across
the North Interior. Wind will remain highly dependent on the
track of this low pressure system, so details will continue to be
refined as guidance comes into better agreement. In addition to
wind and precipitation, coastal flooding will need to monitored
throughout the weekend as astronomical tides peak this weekend
into early next week for coastal areas. With the potential
combination of a sub-1000 mb surface low, tides, and increased
surf activity, coastal flooding potential will continue to be
monitored closely.

Conditions look to remain active heading into early next week as
another disturbance looks to move into the region Sunday into
Monday and bring another round of lowland rain and mountain snow.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow aloft becoming southwesterly later
this afternoon into this evening as an upper level ridge
gradually moves eastward. VFR conditions this afternoon as fog has
mostly dissipated across the region, the exception being KOLM
where fog has been slow to burn off. Fog may look to continue to
linger in the Southwest Interior, with another round of IFR/LIFR
conditions expected tonight. Elsewhere, high clouds moving in
will likely limit the development of fog, although there is a
chance of localized fog in and around Puget Sound.

KSEA...VFR conditions this afternoon as remaining fog has
dissipated across the area. High clouds streaming in this evening
will likely limit fog development near the terminal, but there is
still a 15-20% chance of IFR/LIFR fog, particularly through the
overnight hours. North/northeast winds 5 to 10 knots this,
decreasing to 3 to 6 knots overnight. VFR expected through
Wednesday afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface high pressure will gradually weaken over the
coastal waters tonight before a weak front slides over the area
waters into Wednesday. This front will split and weaken into
Thursday, but will bring some small craft southerlies and some
elevated seas above 10 feet.

A stronger system looks to cross over the coastal waters Saturday
into Sunday, bringing the potential for gale force winds
throughout the coastal waters. Seas look to also build upwards to
around 15 to 18 feet, with the highest seas being over the outer
coastal waters. The inner coastal waters will likely be around 14
to 16 feet, but still a little far out to nail down exact numbers.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Next round of precipitation with a weak system
Thursday will only result in small rises on the rivers. A
stronger storm will set up along the coast over the weekend with
the potential to bring more significant precipitation to the
region. While area rivers will rise, only the Skokomish River is
currently forecast to potentially reach minor flood stage by early
next week. There is still some uncertainty in the precipitation
amounts over the weekend, though conditions will continue to be
monitored. Felton/14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
