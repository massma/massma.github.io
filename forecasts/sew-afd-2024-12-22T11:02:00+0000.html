Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
302 AM PST Sun Dec 22 2024

.SYNOPSIS...The active pattern continues with multiple frontal
systems moving through the area bringing periods of rain, mountain
snow, and gusty winds. The focus shifts towards Christmas into
late next week with potentially higher-impact systems with heavy
rain and snow and gusty winds, especially when combined with
holiday travel.


&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>In the wise words of the
previous shift, it truly will be a rinse, later and repeat kind
of day. Rain from the next system has arrived at the coast and
will spread inland through the morning and into early afternoon.
Gusty wind is expected along the coast, where a wind advisory has
been posted. Wind is not expected to be an issue further into the
eastern Puget Sound lowlands this time as the front is weaker.

Monday will be drier due to short lived ridging between systems,
but things certainly get more active thereafter. A stronger system
will arrive Monday night, bringing more rain, mountain snow and
gusty winds. Winds overnight into Tuesday will be gusty out of the
southeast, with the Cascade gaps and eastern Strait of Juan de
Fuca seeing the stronger wind gusts. By early Tuesday, the winds
are expected to turn more southerly but remain elevated.
Thereafter, the weather is going to continue to remain active, and
given the holidays, it would be good to stay tuned to the forecast
for updates as they relate to travel as there are likely going to
be impacts whether across the Cascade passes or otherwise.


.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Christmas and the
following days will be active weather wise as upward of four to
five additional weather systems barrel into western Washington. On
Wednesday, a strong and wet front will arrive for lowland rain and
mountain snow, as the snow levels will be around 2500 feet. This
may cause periods of heavy snow across the Cascade passes.
Additionally, wind will be gusty, particularly in the afternoon
from the south. Northern Puget Sound and eastern Strait of Juan de
Fuca, as well as the immediate coast will likely see the strongest
winds. Given the amount of precipitation expected, the series of
storms and atmospheric rivers will be hydrologically impactful as
well.

Boxing Day remains wet as another system arrives with windy
conditions expected area wide. Another one then is expected late
in the week. Expect there to be more elevated rivers with possible
flooding, and periods of snow across the Cascades.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mainly VFR with rain spreading inland along a warm front
this morning. Rain with low VFR/MVFR ceilings will once again fill
in by the mid to late morning and transition to showers as a cold
front swings eastward this afternoon. Post frontal showers will
continue to stream inland throughout the morning Monday. Surface
winds will stay generally out of the E/SE 5-15 kt with gusts this
afternoon 20-25 kt at the terminals.

KSEA...VFR through the evening as showers once again spread over the
terminal throughout the day, with ceilings near 3000 ft in showers
later tonight. Winds E/SE 8-12 kt today with occasional gusts to 20
kt possible this afternoon. Winds will shift more S/SW after 06z/Mon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The next in a series of strong frontal systems will
cross western WA today for another round of elevated wind and seas.
Gales are forecast over the coastal waters and the eastern Strait of
Juan de Fuca, with SCA winds across the northern inland waters. In
addition, seas will build to 18 to 22 ft over the coastal waters
throughout the day today.

Additional strong frontal systems will impact the region through the
week ahead, with even stronger winds forecast to move over area
waters Tuesday morning with seas remaining elevated at 15 to 19
feet.

Yet another strong storm system is on track to bring another round
of potentially storm force winds on Wednesday to the outer coastal
waters and at least Small Craft winds to the northern interior
waters and Straits, with seas once again building to 17 to 21 feet.

Additional headlines are possible heading towards the weekend as
both seas and winds are expected to remain elevated.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A series of frontal systems will move through the
area this weekend into early next week and bring several rounds of
precipitation. Widespread river flooding is not likely with minor
rises on area rivers expected. The Skokomish River will briefly
drop below flood stage Sunday morning. Increasing precipitation
around Christmas and into the end of next week could push the
Skokomish back up to moderate flood stage. For the remaining
rivers, the threat of flooding will also increase in the middle of
next week as ensembles continue to indicate the potential for
significant precipitation area-wide. While discrepancies remain,
this most likely will lead to an increased chance of river
flooding becoming more widespread and landslide concerns that may
impact holiday travel.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
