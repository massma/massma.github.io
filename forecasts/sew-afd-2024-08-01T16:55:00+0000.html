Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
955 AM PDT Thu Aug 1 2024

.SYNOPSIS...High pressure aloft will strengthen into the end of
the week for a trend toward warmer and dry conditions. The upper
ridge will weaken somewhat early next week and onshore flow will
strengthen for a modest cooling trend, but temperatures look to
remain above normal with dry conditions continuing.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Clear skies prevail across
Western Washington this morning with upper ridging in control and
weak offshore flow near the surface. A thermal trough is oriented
along the coast today and this will give coastal areas their
warmest day of the week. Most of the interior lowlands away from
the water will warm several degrees today as well...from near 80
north to lower 90s in the Southwest Interior. The thermal trough
axis will shift into the interior lowlands on Friday. Coastal
areas will cool 10 or more degrees on Friday, but interior
locations will remain warm. The overall pattern doesn`t change too
much heading into Saturday. Heights fall a smidge, but onshore
flow doesn`t look strong enough to significantly cool interior
areas.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Moving into early next
week, strong upper ridging centered over the Four Corners region
flattens slightly and weak upper troughing just offshore moves
closer to the region. Despite this subtle shift in the synoptic
pattern, 500 millibar heights remain relatively high...north of
580 dam. Slightly lower heights and a little more onshore flow may
bring some slight cooling, but above normal temperatures and dry
conditions look to continue. The most significant uncertainty in
the extended forecast period lies with any embedded disturbances
in upper troughing that could lead to some thunderstorm activity
over the Cascades. Only a minority of the ensembles show much in
the way of convective possibilities early next week, but it`s
definitely worth watching for fire weather interests. 27

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure remains over the region with mostly
clear skies. Flow aloft becoming southwesterly and continuing into
Friday. May see a few high clouds at times, along with some smoke
toward the Cascades as smoke from regional fires drifts into the
region. VFR through the period with the exception of patchy fog
around the coast after 12z for a few hours with ceilings around
500 ft or lower and restricted visibility. This will clear by 17z
Friday morning.

KSEA...Northerly winds becoming breezy through the afternoon under
clear skies. Winds ease and become light southerly late tonight
through Friday morning.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Thermally induced surface trough developing along the
coast this afternoon will shift inland tonight. After tonight
high pressure over the coastal waters with lower pressure inland
giving varying degrees of onshore flow into the first part of next
week. Seas over the coastal waters will build to around 7 feet
toward the weekend and will be rather steep given the persistent
northwest winds. This is particularly the case beyond about 20 nm
from shore.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
