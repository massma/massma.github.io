Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
406 PM PST Thu Dec 5 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A stronger front is on track to bring more widespread
precipitation this weekend, in the form of snow in the mountains,
and rain at lower elevations. Breezy south to southwest winds are
expected with this front Saturday morning. A brief period of dry
conditions will follow Sunday night into Monday before the active
pattern continues by mid-week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No fog remains this
afternoon with high clouds overhead most of western Washington. A
weak frontal system remains just offshore but continues to weaken
as it moves onshore. Only a few light sprinkles/showers are being
observed on radar over the northern-most portions of the Olympic
Peninsula. Some patchy fog may develop over portions of the Kitsap
Peninsula and portions of the South Sound, but generally not
expected to be dense or widespread. High clouds will help limit
the threat area-wide.

Clouds will continue to increase tonight into tomorrow
as the next system begins to work its way towards the region from
the northeast Pacific. This system will be supported in the upper
levels with a strong closed low to the north with the jet aimed
towards far northwestern Washington up to Vancouver Island. This
will bring a period of active weather expected through the
weekend.

* RAIN...Rain will begin to fall over the northwest Olympic
  Peninsula Friday night as the warm front moves through the area,
  followed by the cold front sinking southeastward across the
  area overnight Friday into Saturday morning. During this period,
  snow levels will rise up to 7000 to 9000 ft, with most of the
  precipitation falling as rain. The highest rainfall amounts are
  currently expected over the north and central Cascades, with
  probabilities of up to 40-60% chance for seeing at least 3
  inches of rain through portions of the Cascades in Snohomish,
  Skagit, and Whatcom counties. Windward slopes of the Olympics
  and the Pacific Coast may see 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain (in 24
  hr ending Saturday afternoon), with around half an inch possible
  in the lowlands through Saturday afternoon.

* SNOW...Saturday afternoon into Sunday, behind the cold frontal
  passage, substantial rain will devolve into showers and
  mountain-enhanced precipitation. Snow levels will rapidly fall
  to around 3500 to 3000 ft. Accumulating snow is expected through
  the passes, with 50-70% probabilities of seeing at least 8 in of
  snow through Stevens and Snoqualmie passes (in 24 hr ending
  Sunday afternoon). With only 10-30% chances of seeing at least 12
  in of snow, a winter storm watch will not be issued with this
  forecast package, though will continue to monitor for trends in
  the snow level and QPF forecasts.

* WIND...Additionally, southerly winds will increase ahead of the
  cold front late Friday into early Saturday, then with
  southwesterly winds increasing behind the front Saturday
  afternoon into early Sunday. Wind speeds continue to be forecast
  below advisory criteria.

* HIGH SURF...Large waves are expected to build along the
  coastline during the day on Sunday will allow for high surf
  conditions to develop along the Pacific coast, including the
  threat for large breaking waves and coastal erosion.

Rain and mountain snow will taper off Sunday night as the surface
low pressure system and associated upper level trough exits the
region.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...The upper level ridge will
move through Monday with the ridge axis moving through Tuesday.
The remainder of the long term forecast remains fairly uncertain,
as the evolution depends on the breadth and amplitude of the
ridge, as well as how quickly the ridge departs. Many model
ensemble members as well as the operational deterministic models
have additional frontal systems tracking through the area by mid
week, particularly Wednesday into Thursday. A wide range of
solutions exist for the evolution of this system, with the
potential for more impactful weather mid to late week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mostly VFR conditions across most of the terminals. Some
low ceilings have persisted near the Strait of Juan de Fuca keeping
conditions under MVFR and IFR. Current radar shows some very light
showers moving through Western Washington, however they are quickly
fleeting. VFR conditions should continue into tonight for most of
the terminals and start to gradually start to decrease into the
morning hours trending towards MVFR. A chance of patchy fog is
possible tonight into Friday night. The fog will be limited to the
Kitsap Peninsula and southern interior, bringing conditions down to
IFR/LIFR. Ceilings appear to eventually lift and show some
improvement in after 21Z as high clouds settle in the region
ahead of a weather system.

KSEA...Currently VFR conditions at the terminal. Ceilings will
gradually lower in the night and morning hours trending toward MVFR.
Guidance hints at the ceilings rising again to VFR conditions
shortly after 18Z. Southerly flow will persist throughout the day
and light rain is looking to be possible as early as 0Z on Friday
afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong frontal system remains on track to move into the
waters this Friday into the weekend, bringing more widespread
advisory strength winds to the coastal waters and portions of the
inland waters, including Admiralty Inlet, the eastern STrait of Juan
de Fuca, and the Northern Inland Waters.Ahead of the front, strong
southerly flow will lead to steep waves along the coastal waters of
Washington. These waves will be around 7-9 ft with a period of 5-7
seconds on Friday. As the frontal system moves over the waters,
southerly flow will become westerly early Saturday morning, which
will allow the waves to build into late Saturday night and Sunday.
Waves in the coastal waters will be around 15-20 ft. Waves will
gradually begin to subside on Monday back to 6-8 ft as winds high
pressure builds over the waters early next week bringing lighter
winds. Additional disturbances look to approach the coastal waters
near midweek.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A shift to a more active pattern will bring a much
stronger weather system across portions of Western Washington. This
will bring widespread precipitation, as well as snow levels climbing
to around 7000 to 9000 feet during the bulk of the heavier rain on
Saturday. This, combined with the heavier rainfall, will result in
rises on rivers across the region. While the precipitation forecast
continues to fluctuate a bit run-to-run, 2 to 3 inches of rainfall
appear most likely. However, high end potential amounts would reach
into the 4 to 5 inch range across portions of the Olympics and the
northern and central Cascades. As a result, a flood potential
outlook (ESF) remains in effect for Whatcom, Skagit, Snohomish, and
Mason counties. These areas see the greatest threat of river
flooding during the late Saturday and Sunday time period. Other area
rivers will continue to be monitored for flood potential. A brief
period of drier conditions will allow for rivers to recede early
next week, but another round of hydrologically significant
precipitation may follow later next week.
