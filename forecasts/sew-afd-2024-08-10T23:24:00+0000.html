Area Forecast Discussion...CORRECTED
National Weather Service Seattle WA
424 PM PDT Sat Aug 10 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Warm conditions will continue today across the
interior with cooler conditions along the coast. Thunderstorms
will remain possible over the Cascades with areas of smoke and
haze aloft. Upper level troughing over the region will persist
over the region the next several days, promoting onshore flow
and cooler temperatures.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...Satellite imagery shows
stratus has retreated back to the coast, with cumulus building
across the portions of the Cascades this afternoon. Thunderstorms
have developed along the far northern Cascades and will continue
to impact the region through this evening as an upper shortwave
brushes by to the north.

An upper low will drop down from British Columbia on Sunday and
deepen the troughing over the Pacific Northwest through the
remainder of the short term period. Another round of thunderstorms
will be possible across the North Cascades on Sunday, however
probabilities will be lower than today and generally persist at
15-25%. Onshore flow will increase and we should see less smoke/haze
over western Washington from nearby wildfires. Another round of
stratus will move inland overnight into Sunday morning, though
expect clouds to take a little longer to scatter out on Sunday.
Temperatures will be cooler as a result, topping out in the 70s
across the interior and mid 60s along the coast.

Upper level troughing will keep temperatures cooler on Monday and
Tuesday, with highs topping out in the 70s across the interior
and 60s along the coast. Additional rounds of stratus look to
move inland during the overnight and early morning hours both
days. Isolated thunderstorm chances are still possible for the
North Cascades on Monday afternoon and evening.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Troughing will continue
to influence the Pacific Northwest from mid to late week, promoting
onshore flow and slightly below normal temperatures in the 60s
and 70s. Another upper level low looks to drop down from the
north late in the week, potentially bringing some chances for
precipitation over higher terrain by next weekend, though will
need to see how this pattern evolves over the next several days.

&&

.AVIATION...Northwest flow aloft with upper level troughing
continuing over western Washington. Clear skies and VFR conditions
prevail across most of the area, except along the Pacific coast
where marine stratus continues to persist bringing IFR conditions to
KHQM. Stratus should continue through the rest of the day along the
coast, and will rebuild and move eastward overnight tonight across
the interior, with widespread IFR to LIFR coverage by 12Z Sunday.
Ceilings will be slow to dissipate but should return to VFR by
midday tomorrow. Winds will remain southwesterly 5 to 10 kt
throughout the TAF period.

KSEA...VFR conditions with mostly clear skies. Marine stratus and
IFR ceilings will return overnight around 12Z Sunday. Ceilings may
rise a touch to low-end MVFR tomorrow morning, but then should
slowly scatter out by around 21Z Sunday. Winds remain southwesterly
5 to 10 kt.

.MARINE...Broad high pressure over the East Pacific with low
pressure inland will maintain northwesterly onshore flow over the
area waters. Diurnally driven pushes down the Strait of Juan de Fuca
will occur each evening. Tonight`s push down the strait will be the
strongest, as such, a Small Craft Advisory remains in effect tonight
for the Central and East Strait. Winds will pick up across the
coastal waters as well tonight, but the strongest winds should be
largely confined to the outermost portions of the area.
After tonight, winds look to largely remain below thresholds through
next week.

Seas 4 to 5 ft will increase tonight up to 6 to near 9 ft into the
outer coastal waters. With the dominant period being 8 seconds,
waves will be steep. A Small Craft Advisory remains in effect for
steep seas in the outer coastal waters from tonight through Sunday
afternoon. Seas will subside on Monday back to 3 to 5 ft and remain
like so through the week.

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Elevated fire weather conditions will persist
through this evening as latest radar shows thunderstorms have
developed across portions of the North Cascades this afternoon.
Isolated thunder will still be possible along the Central Cascades
tonight as well, with guidance indicating a 10-20% chance of
thunderstorm development. Coverage across the western slopes looks
to be less than that of the previous days, however any
thunderstorms that do develop may produce frequent lightning,
brief heavy downpours, hail, and gusty and erratic winds. Despite
rainfall, lightning strikes will have the potential to create new
fire starts.

Thunderstorms will still be possible across portions of the North
Cascades again on Sunday and Monday, however probabilities will
wane with each day. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
