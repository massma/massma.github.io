.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level troughing will remain the dominant
influence across western Washington through much of the next
week. A few weak fronts will bring chances of showers to western
Washington Tuesday into Wednesday. The more notable chances of
precipitation over the next week will be Friday into Saturday as a
low offshore pushes inland over the area.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level troughing will
remain the dominant influence across western Washington through
the first part of the week as an upper level low spins across the
northeastern Pacific.

Onshore flow will continue today for another round of stratus
this morning. Latest satellite imagery already shows stratus
filling in along portions of the Cascades and North Coast early
this morning. Overall, expect the extent of stratus not to be as
widespread as Saturday and for clearing to be more widespread
across the region by this afternoon. The upper level trough over
the northeastern Pacific will dig southward today, allowing for
500 mb heights to amplify somewhat across western Washington. As a
result, afternoon highs will climb a few degrees from yesterday`s
and top out in the upper 60s to mid 70s across the interior. Highs
along the coast will be in the 60s.

Onshore flow will continue into Monday, with clouds increasing
across the region. High temperatures will be similar to today`s,
generally topping out in the upper 60s to low 70s across the
majority of the interior. Highs along the coast will be in the
60s. A few light showers may be possible along the North Coast
with a warm front offshore, but precipitation looks to be rather
minimal.

A weak cold front then looks to approach the region on Tuesday,
bringing increased chances of showers along the coast. Overall
amounts look to be light, with most spots only expected to see a
couple hundredths of an inch of rain. Afternoon highs will again
be in the upper 60s to mid 70s across the interior and low 60s
along the coast.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...The aforementioned cold
front will then make its way inland on Wednesday, bringing
chances of showers to the interior. Overall rainfall amounts look
light at this time, with areas across the lowlands likely only
receiving a trace of precipitation to a few hundredths of an inch.
A few spots may not even see any rain. The highest amounts will
be across the terrain of the North Cascades, where up to a quarter
of an inch of rain is possible. A few post-frontal showers may
linger into Thursday, but expect Thursday to be a drier day across
the region as a whole.

The most notable precipitation for the week is likely Friday into
Saturday as the upper level low situated over the northeastern
Pacific sinks southward and moves inland over the area. This cool
system will allow for snow levels across the Cascades to fall
between 5000-6000 ft and could even bring some wintry precipitation
to the tallest peaks. Will need to see how this continues to trend
over the next several days, however. Afternoon high temperatures
look to only climb into the low to mid 60s for much of the area
during this time. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft persists with a stationary upper
level low over the Gulf of Alaska. VFR conditions early this morning
across the area with mid-level stratus beginning to redevelop.
Ceilings should remain VFR through the morning, through some lower
ceilings may develop that could bring cigs down to MVFR. The areas
most likely to see MVFR cigs are along the Pacific coast and through
PWT and OLM. Any stratus that does develop this morning should
scatter fairly quickly by late morning into early afternoon. Mid to
high level clouds will begin to move in and increase in coverage
tonight into Monday morning, which should curb the low stratus
threat for Monday morning. Light N/NE winds this morning will
increase and become NW during the day today.

KSEA...VFR conditions expected through the TAF period. Mid-level
stratus is developing and may briefly lower ceilings this morning
but cigs should remain VFR. (15-20% chance of MVFR cigs) Skies clear
out this afternoon, with increasing mid to high clouds tonight into
Monday morning. NE winds this morning become NW by midday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will remain in place across the coastal
waters today, helping to maintain northwesterly winds across the
area. Diurnally driven pushes of westerly winds down the Strait
of Juan de Fuca will occur during the evening hours over the next
several days. Westerly winds will continue to ease through the
central and eastern Strait through the early morning hours today,
so will allow the current Small Craft Advisory in place to expire
at 5am. The westerly push tonight generally looks to remain below
small craft strength at this time, with winds mostly persisting
between 15-20 kt.

A weak frontal system will approach the region on Monday and
push through the area waters Tuesday into Wednesday. This will
allow for winds across the coastal waters to transition to
southerly. A low pressure system then looks to sink southward
into the region on Friday and push inland over the weekend.

Seas across the coastal waters will generally remain between 3-5
ft today, increasing to 4-6 ft on Monday. Seas then look to
subside back towards 3-5 ft by midweek. The system at the end of
the week will allow for seas to build towards 6-8 ft by the
weekend. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
