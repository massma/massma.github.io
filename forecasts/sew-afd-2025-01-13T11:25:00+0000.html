Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
325 AM PST Mon Jan 13 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure building over the region today will
provide for morning clouds and fog and mostly dry conditions.
Little change in the pattern through midweek, with a weak system
bringing renewed precipitation chances for Thursday. Drier but
cooler conditions likely return for the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mix of conditions across
the region this morning with some pockets of fog and low stratus
around much of the interior. Meanwhile temperatures mostly in the
30s, with many of the overnight lows already occurring as
developing low clouds have cut off the efficient radiative
cooling of clear skies. Nevertheless, expect a variety of
conditions with some areas of frost in the outlying cooler
locations and variable visibilities under fog and low stratus
elsewhere in the interior. With the ridge pushing overhead,
guidance continues to suggest a rather slow break out from the
clouds this morning (or even this afternoon, in many locations),
which would leave temperatures this afternoon a little it on the
cool side. Expect a similar pattern the next few days with decent
radiational cooling, lowering inversion height under the ridge
axis, and light surface gradients to support rounds of morning fog
each of the next few mornings. With moisture less prominent each
day, expect to see somewhat earlier breakouts each day and
temperatures during the day trending up a few degrees toward
midweek.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Expect some increased
cloud cover late Wednesday into Thursday as ensemble guidance
continues to support a brief shake-up in the pattern as the next
upper trough slides into south-central British Columbia. Some
light precipitation (lowland rain and mountain snow) still is
favored as this weak disturbance pushes through the top of the
ridge and spreads across the area, but the bigger sensible
weather impact for many will be the additional clouds and a bit
more mixing which should bring a brief reprieve from the fog and
any increasingly stagnant air. For the remainder of the week, the
spread in potential scenarios becomes increasingly large owing
primarily to differences in the position and amplitude of the
Pacific ridge - specifically , is it close enough to block the
region from additional disturbances or far enough offshore to
leave the door open. The forecast continues to reflect generally
dry conditions late in the week and through the weekend, but also
cooler overnight lows for Saturday and Sunday nights that could
bring lows into the 20s for most of the interior. Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge over the area with northwesterly
flow aloft. High pressure at the surface with light flow in the
lower levels.

Widespread IFR ceilings over the interior this morning with local
LIFR ceilings and visibility. VFR conditions along the coast. Slow
improvement over the interior this afternoon to high end IFR/MVFR
ceilings with visibility restrictions dissipating around 21z.

KSEA...IFR ceilings lowering to LIFR ceilings with visibility
1-3sm around 15z. Slow improvement after 19z with visibility 5sm
by 21z and ceilings near 1000 feet. Could see a couple hours of
VFR late afternoon/early evening before conditions deteriorate
back down to LIFR ceilings after 04z tonight. Light winds becoming
north 4 to 6 knots this afternoon. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will remain over the waters through
the majority of the week. A weak front will move across the
waters Thursday into Friday.

Possible small craft advisory winds in the Strait of Juan de Fuca
Thursday.

Seas 10 to 12 feet over the waters this morning subsiding to
around 9 feet over the inner coastal waters late morning. Seas
remaining 10 or 11 feet over the outer waters until at least
Tuesday night. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
