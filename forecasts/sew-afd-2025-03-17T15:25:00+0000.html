Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
825 AM PDT Mon Mar 17 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Unsettled weather continuing through the rest of the
day. Upper level ridging building briefly on Tuesday will give way
to a break in the wet weather. A series of multiple systems will
move over the region later in the week trough the weekend for
rounds of lowland rain, mountain snow, and breezy winds at times.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The current forecast
remains on track with no planned updates this morning. 33

Previous discussion...Broad upper level troughing will continue
move over the Pacific Northwest morning. Weak impulses will
gradually move over the region, helping spark some light shower
activity across the area throughout the day, with snow in the
mountains. Snow levels this morning generally around 1500 to 2000
feet. Recent radar imagery shows just a few showers across the
area this morning.

Onshore flow will also increase today, resulting in a convergence
zone developing across the north/central sound around the early
evening hours. Increased shower activity can be expected in any
heavier banding that develops, along with snow levels being
dragged down lower than 1500-2000 feet. At this time, latest hi-
res guidance suggests that areas in the Cascades, particularly
around Snoqualmie Pass, could receive locally higher snow
accumulations this evening due to the convergence zone placement.

Aforementioned troughing will shift eastward into Tuesday,
allowing for upper level ridging to briefly build into the area.
Drier conditions can be expected on Tuesday with maybe just a pop
up shower or two.

Another system will push through western Washington on Wednesday
with lowland rain, mountain snow, and some breezy winds Snow
levels in the 2000 to 3000 feet during this time. Winds look to be
a touch breezy for areas along the coast and possibly the North
Interior.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...The active weather pattern
continues as a stream of systems continues to move through our
area. Lowland rain and more mountain snow will return on Thursday
as a system passes through the area, with another system moving
through on Friday for the same result. The system on Friday
definitely looks a bit wetter than the other ones, with unsettled
weather continuing through the weekend.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow continues aloft through today before more
northwesterly Tuesday morning as weak ridging builds offshore.
Abundant surface moisture this morning is resulting in widespread
MVFR/IFR conditions around Puget Sound, along with areas of LIFR.
There are also some brief vsby reductions in spots, especially
around KOLM. Cigs will slowly improve late morning into early
afternoon towards VFR. A few showers will be around today,
especially this afternoon. A convergence zone is expected to develop
generally between KSEA/KPAE later this afternoon into this evening,
resulting in brief lowering of vsbys and cigs near MVFR. Cigs will
then lower again later tonight into Tuesday morning to MVFR/IFR.
Light S/SW winds this morning will increase from the west this
afternoon.

KSEA...IFR cigs will improve to MVFR generally between 16 to 18z.
Cigs will slowly improve to VFR cigs early this afternoon. A
convergence zone will develop this afternoon, expected to be in the
vicinity of SEA between 22-02z. Cigs will then lower again later
tonight into Tuesday morning. S/SW surface winds this morning will
increase into early afternoon. A wind shift to N/NE associated with
the convergence zone is expected between 23z-03z before winds back
southerly again into tonight. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak surface trough will continue over the waters early
today before ridging builds over the offshore waters later today
into early Tuesday. The ridge will shift eastward Tuesday night as
another front approaches the coastal waters with increasing
southerlies. A period of gales looks likely over the coastal waters
and near the east entrance to the strait just ahead of the front
Wednesday into Wednesday evening. Strong post-frontal onshore flow
will follow Wednesday night into early Thursday with potential gales
across the inland waters...including Puget Sound and Hood Canal.
Another vigorous front is expected to reach the area Thursday night
into early Friday with headlines anticipated for all waters.

Coastal seas will briefly dip below 10 feet later today into Tuesday
before building back into hazardous double digits Wednesday through
most of the remainder of the week. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...At this time, flooding is not expected across most
of the area`s rivers over the next 7 days. The exception remains
the Skokomish River, which could enter flood stage late in the
