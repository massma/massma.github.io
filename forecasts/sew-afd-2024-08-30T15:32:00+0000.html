Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
832 AM PDT Fri Aug 30 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Upper-ridging will remain in place into the weekend.
Here, we`ll see more summer-like conditions. A transient trough
will reintroduce showers into the forecast early next week along
with a cool down in temperatures. However, more subsequent
ridging is slated to soon follow through midweek.

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Quiet morning across the region. Just some patchy fog in
the Snohomish River valley. Otherwise mostly clear skies and calm
conditions. The current forecast is on track and no updates are
planned. -Wolcott-<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Good morning, western
Washington. Current temperatures from a few spots here at 3 AM:
Shelton 50 F - Arlington 54 F - Chehalis 55 F.

An upper-ridge is dominating much of the western US as it centers
over the Great Basin and Intermountain West. That includes us
here in the PNW as large scale subsidence persists. Minuscule
cloud coverage is shown given latest satellite analysis. High
temperatures will climb 5-10 F above average today through
Saturday for late August. Light offshore flow with aforementioned
ridging will top values into the 70s along the coast and areas
adjacent to the inland waters. The interior is expected to range
throughout the 80s with a 70-80% chance of Cascade valley
locations such as Packwood and Randle seeing temps exceeding 90 F
today and a 50-60% chance of exceeding 95 F on Saturday. Overnight
lows are to range between the mid 50s to lower 60s.

Temperatures will begin to cool down on Sunday as onshore flow
switches on. Coastal areas should see the return of more seasonal
conditions however, temps across the interior will remain elevated
as 80s and the chance for 90s continue. Models have an upper-
trough looming offshore that`ll bring not only a widespread shot
of cooler weather but PoPs look to become reintroduced into the
forecast.


.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...As mentioned, guidance
continues to highlight an upper-low arriving Monday into Tuesday.
There remains some uncertainty in its exact track, but for now,
there is still a chance for some precipitation and possibly some
thunderstorms in the Cascades. Confidence is high on temperatures
returning back to the 60s and 70s however, subsequent ridging and
warmer weather will turn towards the second half of the week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge with west southwesterly flow aloft
through Saturday. Low level offshore flow becoming light this
afternoon. Offshore flow increasing again late tonight and Saturday
morning. A few high clouds at times otherwise clear skies through
Saturday.

KSEA...Clear skies. Northeast wind 4 to 8 knots becoming
northerly 6 to 10 knots around 20z. Winds switching back to
northeasterly after 04z. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...Thermally induced low pressure along the coast
during the morning hours will shift inland during the afternoon
and evening hours today and Saturday then shift east Sunday.
Increasing onshore flow Sunday with high pressure over the
coastal waters. The onshore flow pattern will continue into
Tuesday.

Possible small craft advisory westerly winds in the Central and
Eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca Sunday evening and again Monday
evening. Felton

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...High pressure and light offshore is slated to
persist. This will allow relative humidity values to drop into
the 30s today, even as low as 15-20 percent Saturday and Sunday
in the southern parts of the Cascades and mountain valleys.
Relative humidity recovery will be poor overnight, only reaching
around 40- 60%. It will also be unstable over the Cascades, which
would meet critical fire weather criteria.

However, area fuels are currently moist from recent rains,
mitigating the impact of the critical fire weather. Under the
conditions for the rest of the week, fuels will dry out quickly and
it`s not out of the question that ERC`s will exceed the 90
percentile once again and bring the possibility of Red Flag
conditions. It will be important to monitor how fast fuels respond.

.CLIMATE...So far in August there have been 7 days with highs 80
degrees plus in Seattle. This August will break the streak of 12
Augusts in a row with at least 10 80 degree days. The longest
streak of years with at least 10 80 degree plus days in August before
the current streak was only 3 years ( 2004-06, 1996-98, 1990-92
and 1985-87 ). Felton
