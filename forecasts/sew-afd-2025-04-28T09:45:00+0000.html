Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cooler and damp conditions expected for the start of
the week before warmer temperatures return by Wednesday and
Thursday. Precipitation chances return to the forecast by Friday
into next weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Widespread stratus is
apparent on satellite early this morning thanks to continued
onshore flow. A weak frontal system is still expected to drop into
western Washington from the north later this evening, bringing
light rain and through Tuesday morning. Light rain accumulations
are expected, as well as high snow levels above 5,000 to 6,000
feet. Today is likely going to be the coolest day of the week,
with highs in the upper 50s. Beyond Tuesday morning, expect some
lingering showers in the Cascades, but generally drying conditions
elsewhere.

An upper level ridge returns to the PNW by Wednesday, beginning a
warming trend. Temperatures will climb into the mid to upper 60s,
setting the stage for a warmer day still on Thursday.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Absolutely pleasant
temperatures are expected on Thursday as highs climb into the
upper 70s for much of Puget Sound and surrounding Cascade Valleys.
Even coastal locations will reach the upper 60s. Low 80s are
expected in the southwest interior. Enjoy it, as temperatures will
moderate somewhat into the upper 60s and low 70s on Friday as
increased onshore flow resumes with the ridge moving east. This
will allow the next frontal system to move into western Washington
on Friday into Saturday. Exact track of the low will have
implications on how much precipitation the region receives, but at
this point in the forecast cycle, the forecast calls for the bulk
of the rain to fall in the Cascades and northern Olympic coast.
