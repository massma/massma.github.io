Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
310 AM PDT Sun Apr 27 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cooler temperatures expected today, then a weak
frontal system will bring light rain to the region Monday into
Tuesday. A return to dry and warm conditions is expected through
the middle of the week with precipitation chances returning by
late Friday into next weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Night fog satellite imagery
shows more expansive stratus pushing into western Washington this
morning, with increased onshore flow. As such, the stratus is
likely to linger in the area into the late morning and early
afternoon. Somewhat breezy westerlies are expected through the
Chehalis valley as well as Strait of Juan de Fuca this afternoon,
with gusts in the Strait pushing 35 mph.

With a low pressure system moving into California and split flow
aloft, temperatures will be slightly cooler today, in the upper
50s and low 60s. Flow transitioning to a more zonal component will
allow for a weak frontal system to arrive on Monday, bringing
light rain to the area into Tuesday. High snow levels are still
expected for rain to persist in the forecast for all Cascade
passes. QPF amounts for lowland locations is still below a quarter
of an inch, with upwards of a half of an inch along the coast and
high Cascade terrain.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Conditions dry out and
warm up again by midweek as ridging returns. The effect of the
ridge will be most noticeable on Thursday, as temperatures in the
mid to upper 70s are favored throughout Puget Sound. Scattered
highs reaching 80 can`t be ruled out in Cascade valleys or in
portions of the southwest interior. Precipitation chances linger
in the forecast for Friday into next weekend as there are signals
for another frontal system to move into the area, but timing and
exact QPF amounts are uncertain at this time.
