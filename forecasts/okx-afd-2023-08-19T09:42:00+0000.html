.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The forecast is on track with only minor changes needed.

Surface high pressure builds eastward from the Ohio River Valley on
today, resulting in dry weather conditions. The cyclonic flow
and a pool of cool air aloft should allow for the development of
diurnal cu, especially across the lower Hudson Valley and
southern CT, with mostly sunny skies elsewhere.

Temperatures will struggle to reach 80 today. Most top out in
the mid to upper 70s in the afternoon, Humidity levels will be
relatively low for this time of year with dew points in the 50s
region-wide.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

moves east, with lows from the lower 60s inland to mid/upper 60s
metro/coast, highs from the upper 70s to mid 80s, both near to
