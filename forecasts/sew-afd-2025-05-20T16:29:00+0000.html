Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
929 AM PDT Tue May 20 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
Cooler and unsettled conditions will persist across
western Washington through the week as a series of troughs pass
over the region. Conditions are on track to warm up and dry out
over the weekend as ridging develops over the western US.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...A low pressure system
stalled over British Columbia will continue to send a series of
waves across western Washington through Wednesday, maintaining
cooler temperatures with continued shower activity and a chance
for isolated afternoon thunderstorms. Temperatures will peak in
the mid to upper 50s along the coast and in the low 60s further
inland under cloudy skies. Onshore flow will also promote the
potential for areas of fog and low stratus each morning,
especially across the lowlands near the Puget Sound. Convergence
zone showers are expected to linger Wednesday morning along the
King/Snohomish County line before tapering off late Wednesday
morning as the upper low dissipates.

A trough axis will shift inland throughout the day Wednesday, with
the bulk of the moisture associated with this system moving to our
south. Shower activity will mostly be confined to the south of
the Puget Sound through the afternoon and evening Wednesday, with
a slight chance of additional showers over the mountains.

Weak ridging is favored to pass over the region on Thursday,
allowing conditions to warm up and dry out. High temperatures will
return to near normal for mid May with plenty of sun breaks.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Forecast confidence decreases
heading into the weekend, with some uncertainty over precipitation
on Friday. The placement of an approaching cutoff low will
determine whether western Washington stays dry or sees some
showers, but ensembles continue to favor a drier and warmer
solution. An upper level ridge will amplify over the western US by
Saturday, with southwest flow bringing some warming to western
Washington. By Sunday, most of the interior lowlands will likely
see high temperatures well into the 70s with mostly clear skies.

Deterministic forecast models hint at a front crossing western
Washington on Monday, bringing in cooler conditions. However,
models remain fairly consistent over splitting the front as it
moves inland, keeping western Washington on the drier side. Any
incoming showers that materialize would be light in nature, only
dropping a few hundredths of an inch. Both operational and
ensemble forecasts also suggest that ridging could dominate the
forecast into early next week, but models continue to show a wide
spread in solutions.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft will become more northwesterly later
this afternoon. Scattered shower activity continues for areas along
the Olympic Peninsula and for areas generally north of KPAE this
morning, with many of the central Sound terminals still remaining
rain shadowed.

A mix of ceilings between VFR and MVFR across the terminals this
morning. Guidance is still hinting at ceilings lowering this morning
to high-end MVFR to low-end VFR between 16z-19z, with improvement
expected later in the afternoon. However, with shower activity
continuing throughout the day, this could bring localized pockets of
reduced ceilings and visibility at times. Isolated thunderstorms
will also be possible across the region today (15-25% chance), but
confidence remains too low to include in any single TAF issuance at
this time. Increasing onshore flow tonight will likely aid in the
development of a convergence zone over Snohomish/King counties (near
KPAE) between 03-06z. Southerly surface winds will generally persist
for interior terminals between 7-12kt today and could become breezy
this afternoon with gusts 18-22 kt possible. Westerly surface winds
expected for coastal terminals between 10-15 kt.

KSEA...VFR this morning at the terminal and ceilings will gradually
lower later this morning (16z-17z). Guidance has backed off slightly
on how low the ceilings will lower, so may end up seeing high-end
MVFR to low-end VFR. Scattered shower activity through the day could
briefly bring a reduction in ceilings and visibility to the terminal
at times. Convergence zone development still trending to remain
north of the terminal tonight. S/SW winds at 7-12 kt, with gusts to
20 kt possible this afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow will continue across the region, with a
weak westerly push expected through the Strait of Juan de Fuca
tonight. While sustained winds look to generally remain between 15-
20 kt, probabilistic guidance highlights a 60-80 percent chance of
wind gusts reaching small craft criteria across portions of the
central and eastern Strait for a brief period tonight. Thus, have
gone ahead and issued a small craft advisory for these areas.
Small craft advisories also remain in effect for the coastal waters
and the Western Strait for seas between 10-13 ft today. Seas are
expected to gradually subside towards 8-10 ft again tonight into
Wednesday.

Weak high pressure will build back into the area waters Wednesday
and Thursday, bringing northwesterly winds to the coastal waters.
Seas will continue to subside towards 4-6 ft into Thursday. A
weakening system may approach the waters on Friday, before high
pressure builds into the coastal waters again over the weekend.
Another system may approach the area waters again late in the
weekend into early next week.
