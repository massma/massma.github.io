Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
642 PM EDT Sat Sep 30 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
Offshore low pressure will continue to track out into the western
Atlantic, while high pressure builds in through the middle of
next week. The high may start to move offshore at the end of
the week as the next frontal system approaches from the west.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SUNDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showers, mainly light in intensity, will still be possible this
evening across eastern LI and SE CT. Otherwise, diminishing
clouds for tonight as an upper low departs and a strong upper
ridge begins to build in from the west. Low temperatures tonight
will be in the 50s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT/...
For Sunday, high pressure moves in from the Great Lakes
resulting in lots of sunshine with highs in the mid to upper
70s, but cooler across eastern LI with an onshore flow. This is
also above normal by about 5 degrees. Overnight lows Sunday will
be in the mid 50s to low 60s.

&&

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
Deep layered ridging over the Northeast will promote an extended
period of dry weather through the midweek period. Monday through
Thursday will be dry with above-normal temperatures, thanks to the
ridge aloft.

A 500mb trough then digs into the Great Lakes Region on Friday. This
will help push a cold front through the forecast area at some point
Friday night into Saturday. Showers in association with the front as
well as moisture increasing from off the Atlantic ahead of the front
will bring a chance of showers across the area starting on Friday,
with higher overall chances Friday night and Saturday as the cold
front passes through. Highs both days will be cooler and closer to
normal.

&&

.AVIATION /00Z SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
Offshore low pressure will continue to track out into the western
Atlantic. Any remaining light showers or pockets of drizzle will
continue to taper off through 21Z. KGON may hold onto showers
through the early evening. Any IFR/MVFR conditions expected to
improve to VFR after 21-00Z

Winds are N around 10 kt with occasional gusts to 20 kt. Gusts
should taper tonight and remain N less than 10 kt through much of
the TAF period.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Amendments possible this afternoon to address the timing of
improving flight categories.

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...VFR.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>SCA conditions expected to remain for the ocean waters as a
lingering swell maintains wave heights up to 5 feet through
Monday. Sub-SCA conditions are then forecast Monday night
through the middle of the week with a weak pressure gradient in
place over the waters.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
No hydrologic impacts are expected through next week.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Coastal flood advisories remain unchanged and remain in effect
through Sunday morning`s high tide cycle. Where advisories are in
effect, minor flooding might be more on the isolated side with
tonight`s high tide cycle. Statements weren`t needed tonight
elsewhere.

The only change to the headlines was go with a statement for
Brooklyn and Staten Island Sunday morning as isolated areas may
briefly touch minimal flooding benchmarks.

For Monday, statements may still be needed for the south shore back
bays of Nassau and Queens as well as Southern Westchester and
Southern Fairfield Counties.


NOTE: The Peconic River at Riverhead tidal gauge is out of service
(had been reading too high). The gauge is being looked into by our
partners at the USGS.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
