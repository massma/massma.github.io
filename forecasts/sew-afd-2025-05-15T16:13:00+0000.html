Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
913 AM PDT Thu May 15 2025

.SYNOPSIS...A weak upper level ridge remains overhead early
this morning, but this will quickly be replaced as the next
frontal system crosses Western Washington today. This will usher
in the next round of steadier rain across the area through the
evening. An unsettled weather pattern will remain in place
across the Pacific Northwest this weekend through early next
week, maintaining widespread clouds and rain showers.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light precip will spread
inland today, reaching the interior this afternoon. Cooler with
temps in the 50s. No major changes from the previous forecast. 33

Previous discussion...A few lingering showers in a loosely
organized convergence zone are evident on radar this morning, but
this is continuing to decrease this morning as onshore flow
decreases and increasing subsidence develops over the region. The
next frontal system is already approaching the coastal waters and
coming into the view of radar coverage this morning. This
disturbance will reach the coastline by mid- morning and continue
to slowly advance inland later today bringing a bit more
widespread rainfall. With colder air aloft, expect some snow in
the mountains above around 4,500 feet as this system reaches
inland. Additional disturbances will maintain cool, cloudy
conditions into the weekend, with shower chances continuing. Will
need to continue to monitor the Saturday afternoon and evening
time period for a few thunderstorms as instability increases. The
chances remain highest (around 15%) for areas south and east of
Puget Sound and lower elsewhere. Otherwise, temperatures through
the period generally in the upper 50s to around 60, or around 5
degrees below normal for this time of year. Cullen

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...The cool and
showery pattern will continue through much of Sunday, with
another brief lull Sunday night as heights rise over the region
in between disturbances. This appears to be a quite short break,
however, with good ensemble agreement supporting generally
zonal flow that will keep the door open to abundant cloud cover
and rounds of showers as disturbances move through the region.
Temperatures generally hold within a few degrees of seasonal
normals and change little day to day. Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West to northwest flow aloft expected as a weak upper
trough and associated frontal system approaches Western Washington.
Ceilings will lower to MVFR in light rain along the coast this
morning with said conditions spreading to the interior terminals
after 20Z this afternoon. MVFR ceilings in scattered rain showers
with then persist across the region overnight into much of Friday.

KSEA...VFR ceilings are expected to lower to primarily MVFR in
scattered showers 20Z-22Z. These conditions will then persist
overnight and continue through much of Friday. Surface winds S/SW 6
to 10 knots.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure over the coastal and offshore waters
will weaken today as a frontal system approaches the area. The front
will weaken as it moves onshore on Friday. Surface ridging will
rebuild offshore on Saturday then shift into the coastal waters
early next week. Another frontal system looks to move through the
area on Monday. Seas will generally remain under 10 feet through the
forecast period. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
