Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
302 PM PST Sun Nov 10 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A frontal system will move through the region tonight
into Monday for lowland rain, mountain snow and the potential
of river flooding. Active weather will continue through the
remainder of the week, with more lowland rain, mountain snow,
potential river flooding, chances of thunder, high surf and breezy
conditions. Cooler conditions at the end of next week with more
troughing.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>We saw a decent break
today with mainly high clouds, a few sunbreaks and temps in the
50s. However, we`re still on track for a period of active weather
starting tonight and continuing past midweek. Main impacts this
week will be moderate to heavy rain, mountain snow, chance of
thunderstorms, rising rivers with potential flooding, high surf
and coastal flooding.

Rain associated with the first strong system is reaching the
coast now and will spread inland overnight and through Monday.
Total rainfall amounts are on the order of 1-3" along the coast
and mountains with around 1-1.50" in the interior. Snow levels are
initially high (over 6000`) but will come down to 4000-5000` on
Monday with periods of heavy snow in the north Cascades (including
SR 20 and Washington Pass) - a Winter Weather Advisory remains in
effect. Expect gusty winds tonight for the coast and north
interior with S winds gusting to 25-35 MPH. The weather Monday
night and Tuesday turns more showery with a trough moving in. The
air mass will be slightly unstable along the coast for a chance of
thunderstorms. Meanwhile, this system will generate strong waves
with swells of 14-20 feet approaching the coast Monday night into
Tuesday.

The second, wetter and stronger system, then moves in Tuesday
night and Wednesday, keeping the pattern active. The focus and
concerns remain the same with an eye on the river levels due to
back-to-back wet systems. Several rivers are forecast to reach
Action Stage with a few close to Minor flooding. 33

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Showers continue into
Thursday with deep upper level troughing over Pac NW. Steady
rainfall will have ended with rivers likely cresting and receding.
The air mass still remains slightly unstable with a chance of
thunderstorms (mainly coast). Snow levels will be lower, around
4000`, with accumulating snowfall over the higher peaks and
passes. Coastal flooding may be a concern with higher
astronomical tides and seas still running high (10-15 ft). Friday
and Saturday will be cooler with highs in the 40s and lows in the
30s. More rain and mountain snow moving through next weekend with
additional incoming systems. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft as an upper low churns offshore.
Widely VFR across most terminals (localized MVFR - KHQM & KCLM) this
afternoon. MVFR criteria will become more widespread from west to
east tonight into Monday morning as a moist front enters with steady
rainfall. Increasing southerly surface winds will also become breezy
during this time as well. Rainfall is expected to then break into
showers as Monday progress while VFR conditions return by noon.

KSEA...VFR at the terminal so far this afternoon. However, rainfall
is slated to begin around 02-03z with MVFR cigs following overnight
and settling around 08-12z. Rainfall is slated to break into showers
Monday morning as as VFR conditions return. Light SE winds will turn
more southerly after midnight between 10-15 kt with gusts up to 25
to 30 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Seas have trended lower but winds are increasing ahead of
a frontal system arriving tonight/early Monday morning. SCA strength
winds expected tonight across most zones. A slight chance (20%) of
SCA winds are possible during a brief window on Monday but a better
chance exists on Monday night, but still marginal. Then, seas will
rebound greatly as a 18-22 ft swell train arrive by Tuesday morning.
These seas will also be met with the potential for gales on Tuesday
night (60-80% chance across Eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca and
coastal zones, and even a 40% chance for Puget Sound). Conditions
are slated to remain active throughout the week as a parade of
disturbances enters the region.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A more significant chance of precipitation is
expected through Monday, and again on Wednesday as an active
weather pattern returns with weak to potentially moderately strong
atmospheric river events coming through the area. The
precipitation amounts will be strongly orographically influenced
with precipitation totals in the mountains expected to be 3 to 5
inches for both storms except locally over 6 inches on the
Olympics for the last one (Wednesday).

The succession of storms will increasingly build up soil moisture
and river levels throughout this period which will increase the
possibility for river flooding. Snow levels vary generally from
4000 to 6000 feet which will impact precipitation type and affect
the amount of storm runoff.

At this time, the Skokomish River is the only river forecasted to
rise into flood stage, and potentially into moderate flood stage
during the middle of next week. For other rivers, significant
rises are expected with several river forecast points above Action
Stage, and flooding could be possible, especially in the Northern
and Central Cascades. Flooding extent will continue to depend on
rainfall rates, temperatures, as well as snow levels with
precipitation that falls with each of these weather systems next
week. We will continue to assess the hydrologic conditions and
forecasts for any additional areas of potential flooding.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
