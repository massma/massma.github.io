Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
411 PM PST Mon Dec 30 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Shower activity will continue across western Washington
this afternoon as an upper level trough swings across the area.
Showers will then gradually taper tonight for a drier day on
Tuesday. The active weather pattern returns mid to late week as a
series of systems moves through the region and brings additional
rounds of lowland rain, mountain snow, and breezy conditions.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A mostly cloudy day across
western Washington with scattered showers persisting across the
region. These showers are being forced by an upper level short wave
centered over Vancouver Island. The upper level vorticity maximum is
evident on water vapor imagery, as is the moisture it is pulling
into the area to help keep showers going. This wave will continue to
move inland tonight, allowing shower coverage to slowly decrease,
becoming mostly dry after midnight tonight. Snow levels are
sitting around 2000 to 2500 ft. A few more inches of light
accumulating snow will be possible at the passes through the
remainder of the day, with 2 to 4 inches possible. Cool air aloft
will move in behind the shortwave, allowing for low temperatures
to drop to the low to mid 30s, even into the upper 20s in some of
the Cascade foothills and valleys. While this is fairly close to
the average for lows this time of year, this is the first time
much of the area will see overnight lows near to below freezing in
around 2 to 3 weeks.

A very brief ridge will allow conditions to dry out for most of the
day on Tuesday before the next front arrives Tuesday evening and
moves through overnight into early Wednesday. This front will not
have much moisture with it, with a few hundredths up to a quarter of
an inch of liquid-equivalent precipitation forecast for most of
the area by Wednesday afternoon. 3 to 6 inches of snow
accumulations are possible for the mountains in the 36 hours from
Wednesday into early Thursday, but with such light snow rates, the
impact to the passes is expected to be fairly low. The cold air
mass will remain over the area, with snow levels as low as 1000 to
1500 ft overnight Tuesday into Wednesday. Some light snowfall may
be seen in higher elevations through some of the Cascade Valleys.
Models are also hinting at a rain/snow mix over the higher
elevations of the western Kitsap Peninsula near Hood Canal. In
these cases, the thermal profile is fairly limited with the lowest
temperatures at the surface in the mid 30s and a very moist
profile, placing the wet bulb temperature above freezing. If a
heavy shower develops in these locations and the precipitation
rate enough such that it is able to overcome the melting rate,
snow could make it down to the surface. Luckily, with how warm
temperatures have been, surface and road temperatures are likely
above freezing, meaning little to no accumulation is expected.

The main band of rain associated with the front will move through
the area Wednesday morning, with only a few scattered showers behind
the system for most of the day Wednesday. It may be fairly dry for
most during the day on Wednesday. Warmer air aloft will being to
work into the area Wednesday night into Thursday as ridging attempts
to build over the area. Thursday may also be mostly dry with the
best chances for light rain and light snow over the mountains.
Temperatures Thursday will be warm back up closer to where we have
been, with lows in the upper 30s to near 40 and highs in the upper
40s to near 50.

The threat for minor coastal flooding will need to continue to be
monitored, potentially as early as high tide Thursday as tide levels
slowly begin to rise with the next round of perigean spring tides.
Weather systems continuing into the long term forecast period could
exacerbate the threat of coastal flooding.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Models have been fairly
consistent on developing a more robust low pressure system over the
northeast Pacific and tracking into our area on Friday. There is
still quite a bit of range on the exact track of this low pressure
system, the low center could track as far south as Oregon or as far
north as central British Columbia. This has big implications for how
much rain we could receive (where the peak moisture plume falls) and
also how gusty the winds will be (how close and how deep the center
of low pressure becomes). Regardless, expect continued chances for
rain, mountain snow, and breezy winds. With this system being
warmer, several inches of liquid precipitation is possible. Snow
levels rise to 4000 to 5000 ft through the western half of the
region. Easterly flow with cold air in eastern Washington will keep
the passes below freezing with snow being the main precipitation
type. The pattern looks to remain active this weekend and going into
next week with additional shortwaves moving through the area,
keeping chances for rain, snow, and wind in the forecast.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>MVFR conditions prevailing across many of the terminals
as scattered showers continue to move across Western Washington.
Ceilings may continue to bounce back between MVFR and VFR during
breaks in the clouds and showers. Rain should taper off later this
afternoon/evening, with ceilings still remaining MVFR through the
remainder of the majority of the TAF period. Patchy fog is possible
tonight into the morning hours across the Kitsap Peninsula and South
Puget Sound, likely dissipating after 18Z. Visibilities may decrease
to as low as 1.5 miles (around 30% chance). Guidance is hinting at
some improved ceilings around 21Z Tuesday for some of the interior
terminals for a couple hours. However, rain is expected to impact
the coastal terminals as early as 23Z and eventually become more
widespread inland.

Southerly flow will persist and eventually shift
easterly/northeasterly as early as 5Z on Tuesday along the coast
and 18-21Z for the inland terminals.

KSEA...Ceilings have been bouncing back and forth between MVFR and
VFR. Ceilings are expected to remain mostly MVFR through the
majority of the TAF period. Scattered showers continue to move
through the terminal but should diminish later this afternoon/evening.
Showers are expected to return near the end of the TAF period as
early as 3Z on Wednesday and becoming more widespread.

Southerly flow will continue to persist through the majority of the
TAF period with winds speeds hovering between 5-7 kt. Flow will
eventually shift easterly/northeasterly around 21Z with winds 4-6
kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface high pressure over the area is currently
bringing calmer conditions to Washington`s waters, with waves
hovering below 10 ft. However, a weather system is expected to move
over the coastal waters on Tuesday, bringing unsettled conditions to
the region. Winds are expected to gradually increase to small craft
criteria along coastal waters and east entrance of the Strait of
Juan de Fuca on Tuesday morning. A Small Craft Advisory is set to go
into effect at 8 AM PST for these areas. Winds should begin to taper
off early Wednesday morning below small craft criteria. Seas are
expected to rise between 8 to 11 ft on Tuesday and subside below 10
ft on Wednesday. Model guidance does hint at possible steep seas on
Tuesday, however confidence is not high as guidance values only get
near the threshold.

Another system is expected to move over the coastal waters on
Friday, bringing another chance of small craft criteria winds and
waves between 8 to 12 ft. Waves should decrease below 10 ft on
Sunday night.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An active weather pattern will promote additional
rounds of lowland rain across western Washington throughout the
week. The Skokomish River has fallen below minor flood stage and is
expected to remain below flood stage (more precisely in action
stage) throughout the next several days. Late Thursday into Friday,
a warmer system looks to bring 4000 to 5000 ft snow levels to the
Olympic Peninsula basin. Additional precipitation associated with
the system may bring the Skokomish River closer to minor flood stage
again.
