Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
356 PM PST Sun Dec 22 2024

.SYNOPSIS...The active pattern continues with multiple frontal
systems moving through the area bringing periods of rain, mountain
snow, and gusty winds. The focus shifts towards Christmas into
late next week with potentially higher-impact systems with heavy
rain and snow and gusty winds, especially when combined with
holiday travel.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front is
currently sitting just offshore and moving through the area this
afternoon, with rain showers moving across the area. Snow levels
are fairly high across the region (around 5000 ft). Light easterly
flow is keeping temperatures near freezing at the surface over the
passes with light snow showers and some light accumulation.
Precipitation will taper off tonight. Monday looks to be mostly
dry through the day with the next system Monday night into
Tuesday. The warm front will move early Tuesday morning with
mostly rain. Easterly wind at the passes will keep the snow levels
locally lower for another period of a few inches of accumulating
snow. East winds will also pick up area wide early on Tuesday,
with the strongest winds expected through the Cascade gaps, the
Strait of Juan de Fuca, and the Pacific Coast, where gusts 30 to
40 mph are possible. The cold front will move through later in the
morning on Tuesday, allowing winds to ease Tuesday morning and
stratiform rain will transition to scattered showers.

Another break in the rain is possible Tuesday night before a more
substantial system arrives Christmas Day. This system looks to be
the wettest compared to the previous systems with more of an
atmospheric river type setup. Most of the rainfall will be over
the Pacific coast and the Olympics, where widespread 3 inches of
rainfall, with local peaks 4-5 inches are expected. Around an inch
of liquid precipitation is expected for the lowlands and the
Cascades. Snow levels will be higher to the west, around 4000-5000
ft, while closer to pass level over the Cascades, with
significant accumulating snowfall above 3000 ft in elevation,
especially later in the day into Wednesday evening. Winds will
also be very gusty on Wednesday, with strong south to
southeasterly winds along the coast and the north interior being
the strongest.

In addition to precipitation, building waves along the coast will
create several periods of high surf conditions, with the first
being Monday, with additional periods of high surf possible
Tuesday into Wednesday. Waves will initially be long period, with
significant wave run-up and erosion being the primary impacts
Monday before large breakers become more likely early Tuesday and
Wednesday.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...An extended wet period will
continue Boxing Day into next weekend for continued rain, heavy
mountain snow above 3500 ft, and periods of gusty winds. The upper
level pattern looks messy with many back-to-back waves with
little to no breaks between them. This will cause impacts from
rain and snow to slowly increase through the weekend. High tide
levels will also begin to increase next weekend, and with the
active pattern showing no signs of slowing down, this could create
impacts as early as next weekend even though the highest tides
will not occur until the first week of January.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Widespread rain with lowering ceilings and visibility,
along with gusty southerly winds, continue this evening as a front
pushes onshore. The cold front will sweep through later tonight,
with additional showers in the unstable post-frontal environment.
Confidence too low for any thunderstorm mention in TAFs, but chances
will be highest (around 20%) near the coastal terminals. Ceilings
generally lower to widespread MVFR (local IFR possible) late tonight
into early Monday. Surface winds become easterly and increase late
Monday evening.

KSEA...VFR today in rain ahead of the approaching front. Brief
lowering cigs/visibility possible late today in heavier rain.
Southerly surface winds increase with gusts 20-25 kt this afternoon
and evening, with speeds easing early Monday and winds becoming
easterly late Monday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Winds are peaking this afternoon as this frontal system is
advancing inland. Will maintain the current gale warnings and small
craft advisories into the evening. Meanwhile, seas continue to build
and will reach 18 to 20 feet over the coastal waters by early
Monday.

The pattern will remain active with additional lows developing and
moving through the northeastern Pacific with the associated fronts
pushing across the local waters. Expect several rounds of stronger
winds and seas building to 15 to 20 feet through the week. At this
point, the stronger systems look to arrive around Wednesday and late
Friday or Saturday, with brief easing of conditions in between each
system. The Wednesday system will bring likely gales with some
potential for storm force winds to portions of the coastal waters.
The pattern looks to remain active into next weekend. 12<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A series of frontal systems will move through western
Washington next week and bring several rounds of precipitation.
The most hydrologically significant system will be the atmospheric
river arriving Christmas into Thursday, with few breaks in the
precipitation late week into next weekend.

Currently, the Skokomish river is the only river of concern before
Christmas. It will return to minor flood stage this evening and
likely remain near there through Tuesday. There is a chance it may
dip just below minor flood Wednesday but will likely remain in the
upper end of action stage. The system Wednesday will potentially
push the river into moderate early on Thursday and looks to remain
in flood stage through at least late-week.

Wednesday`s system will also increase the level of concern to
other area rivers in the Olympic Peninsula and the Chehalis Valley
area where higher snow levels (4000-5000 ft) will prevail. Lower
snow levels are expected over the Cascades, but with chances for
significant perception continuing through late week, significant
rises and additional river flooding cannot be ruled out going into
next weekend. Additionally, this precipitation will enhance the
risk for landslides across the area which may create significant
impacts to holiday travel.
