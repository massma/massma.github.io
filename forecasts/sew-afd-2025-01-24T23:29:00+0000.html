.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Offshore upper-level ridge building into Northern
British Columbia over the weekend with the ridge moving directly
over Western Washington Monday and Tuesday. Ridge shifting east
Wednesday night with an organized front Thursday with and leading
into Friday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Skies are trending clear
across W WA as dry northerly flow settles overhead. An upper-ridge
is portioned over the Gulf of Alaska and it won`t be in a hurry
to progress. For tonight, dry and cold conditions are in the
forecast as temps bottom mostly into the 20s. Rural areas away
from water sources are likely to be the coldest as values fall
into the lower 20s. Locations along the immediate coastline will
be the warmest in the lower to mid 30s. Frosty surfaces and
patchy fog/low clouds are favorable into Saturday morning as
surface winds relax.

Not much change expected in the short term forecast. Guidance
agrees on the aforementioned ridge`s center just west of Haida
Gwaii on Saturday before gently progressing. By monday, its axis
will reside off the Washington coast as it cuts into Vancouver
Island and the rest of BC. Dry and cold conditions are expected as
widespread overnight lows in the 20s persist. A few isolated
areas may flirt with Cold Weather Advisory criteria for Friday and
Saturday night (Arlington, Enumclaw, etc.) but, it looks like
we`ll remain just above criteria and as a result we have decided
to off on issuing any products.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Deterministic guidance agree
on the upper-ridge remaining in place Tuesday through Wednesday.
However, changes are appearing more favorable for Thursday as the
ridge pushes more eastward and inland. An organized front is
slated to arrive by Thursday evening with the best chance for
widespread precipitation we`ve seen in quite some time. Snow
levels will be around 2500 to 3000 feet with the mountains
getting a few inches of new snow.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northerly flow aloft continues over Western
Washington with upper ridging poised offshore and an upper
trough digging southward over the Northern Rockies. VFR prevails
with the exception of patchy LIFR freezing fog restricted to the
Southwest Interior and extreme south Puget Sound Saturday morning.

KSEA...Clear skies. Surface winds northerly 10 to 13 knots
will ease to northeasterly 7 knots or less this evening.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface ridging strengthens over interior British
Columbia and east of the Cascades today into Saturday while a broad
surface trough deepens well to the south over California. This will
lead to northerly or weak offshore flow. This general pattern
remains in place into early next week. The next front will approach
the coastal waters around the middle of next week.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
