National Weather Service New York NY
1020 AM EST Tue Dec 24 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
A clipper system passes north of the region today. High pressure
returns tonight and will remain in control through Saturday. A
frontal system slowly approaches Saturday night through Sunday.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Snowfall is quickly deteriorating and shifting to more eastern
locations this morning. The snow is becoming lighter with less
in the way of accumulations expected. Snow lingering across
Eastern Long Island and Southeast Connecticut within next hour.
Mainly dry conditions expected for the entire region after 11AM.
Helping ensure dry conditions is overall mid level negative
vorticity advection this afternoon which will allow for more
subsidence of vertical motions.

Conditions will quickly improve from west to east through late
this morning. Dry conditions are expected across the area
this afternoon with partly to mostly cloudy skies. Temperatures
should be able to rise into the middle and upper 30s in the
afternoon.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/...
The shortwave and clipper system continue moving off the New England
coast tonight. Ridging builds aloft behind it allowing surface high
pressure to return across New England Tuesday through Thursday
night. Expect dry, but cold conditions with temperatures Wednesday
and Thursday in the 30s and lows at night falling into the teens and
20s.

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
Upper ridging along the east coast Friday moves into the Western
Atlantic during Friday into Saturday, and remains into Sunday. A
trough over the midsection of the nation sends a shortwave through
the area Sunday night into Monday. At the surface high pressure over
the region Friday shifts into the Atlantic through the weekend. A
frontal wave approach Saturday night and moves through the area into
the beginning of next week. Timing of the system has come into
better agreement however, placement is still somewhat uncertain.
Especially by Sunday the placement of the wave, and potentially a
warm front becomes more uncertain.
And uncertainty with temperatures increases. Have generally used
the NBM probabilities, but capped at the high end of chance.
Precipitation will be mainly rain, with a chance of some light snow
at the onset Saturday night.

Temperatures will be near seasonal normals Friday, and then rise
above normal Saturday into the beginning of next week. Used the
deterministic temperatures Saturday into Monday.
