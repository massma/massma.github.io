Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
811 PM PDT Sun Aug 25 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Weak high pressure returns to the area today before
another system moves in from the north on Monday into Tuesday.
High pressure reestablishes itself over the region Wednesday
onward for more seasonable temperatures and drier conditions. Low
level flow will be turning offshore Thursday into next weekend.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A quiet night on tap with
no planned updates. 33

Previous discussion...Lots more sunshine is prevailing this
afternoon as clouds have widely scattered. Temperatures are in the
60s and low 70s this afternoon. Shortwave ridging will keep
things dry for the rest of today and much of tomorrow ahead of the
next system that will move in from the north Monday evening.
Winds will begin to pick up from the WSW on Monday afternoon, with
the breeziest locations being throughout Puget Sound, the Pacific
coast and along the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Area wide winds will
increase to 10 to 15 miles per hour, gusting to 20 to 25 miles per
hour by early Tuesday morning, lasting into the afternoon.

Rainfall on Monday night into Tuesday will be light for most in
Puget Sound, with only a few hundredths to a tenth of an inch of
rain likely. Slightly higher amounts of up to a quarter to half
inch of rain are possible in the central and northern Cascades.
This activity will taper by Tuesday afternoon and high pressure
will resume come Wednesday. Temperatures will be slower to rebound
on Wednesday in the wake of the previous system, but high
pressure is trending to remain over the area for the rest of the
late week period, offering a better chance at seasonal to slightly
above average temperatures by the end of the week.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...High temperatures will
become steadily warmer on Thursday and climb into the upper 70s
and low 80s for much of western Washington. This can be attributed
partly due to light offshore flow setting in by the late morning
hours on Thursday as thermal troughing sets up along the Oregon
and Washington coasts. Relative humidity values through the
Cascade gaps and through portions of the southwest interior will
decrease into the 30 percent range, but in the absence of stronger
flow, will pose less fire weather concerns. This offshore flow
pattern will repeat into the weekend, and will continue to bring
the relative humidity values in the Cascades down as it continues.
Recoveries overnight will be in the 60 to 80 percent range,
minimizing concerns posed by the low points in the afternoons. The
warmest day of the upcoming forecast period looks to be Saturday,
with widespread highs in the low to mid 80s.

Ensemble and deterministic forecasts are attempting to show a
cut-off low form off the northern California coast by next Sunday,
meandering onshore and potentially picking up some monsoonal
moisture to return to the PNW with. Right now, nothing is certain
at this lead time, but should it remain a persistent feature in
subsequent model runs, could be the next point of interest once
the upper level ridge begins to move out of the area. Wouldn`t put
much stock in this outcome for now, but something to watch.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak high pressure aloft remains across Western
Washington, which is maintaining northerly flow at the upper levels.
CIGs are VFR across the region (exceptions with low clouds still
holding in the East Strait of Juan de Fuca, and in the Cascades
towards Pierce County Airport). The surface winds have become light
northwesterly this evening, and will virtually be light & variable
or calm overnight before slowly picking up out of the southwest
tomorrow morning ahead of the next disturbance, bringing a front
late Monday. Low CIGs will push through the Southwest Interior and
the Strait of Juan de Fuca overnight, potentially reaching the
outskirts of Puget Sound Monday morning (low confidence) before
lifting to VFR mid Monday morning. As the front approaches, high
CIGs will fill in Monday afternoon west to east. Rain showers are
expected as the front sweeps through Monday evening.

KSEA...Surface winds have already become light northerly this
evening. Will become more light overnight and veer back to the south
Monday morning. The push through the Southwest Interior Monday
morning is expected to remain short of the terminal (20% chance of
MVFR, 10% chance of IFR), but any CIGs that do roll in Monday will
clear mid to late morning. Frontal system will bring a chance of
showers primarily overnight Monday/Tuesday in the terminal.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure remains across the waters through
tonight and into early Monday. However, this will be a short break
with the next frontal system reaching the waters late Monday before
it pushes onshore Tuesday. Stronger winds behind the front will
likely bring winds to 25 kt starting late Monday night over portions
of the coastal waters and then the Strait of Juan de Fuca into
Tuesday. This will build seas closer to 7 to 8 feet, especially over
the outer coastal waters, with choppy conditions resulting from the
persistent northerly winds. A more typical late summer pattern
develops for the second half of the week with diurnally driven winds
peaking during the afternoon and evening hours and shorter period
seas over the coastal waters. Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
