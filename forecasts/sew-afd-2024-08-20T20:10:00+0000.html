Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
110 PM PDT Tue Aug 20 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cool and occasionally showery conditions are expected
through the rest of the week. Occasional isolated thunderstorm
chances will also be present from time to time, but are unlikely
to reach the intensity of those from this past weekend. A gradual
shift to warming and drying conditions is expected next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Shower activity
continues to track eastward across western Washington this
afternoon with individual bands/cells propagating to the
northeast. Thus far, only a couple of lightning strikes have been
noted over the coastal waters, with no strikes over land. That
said, there is enough instability around to support at least brief
thunderstorm development this afternoon. Sounding profiles and
mesoanalysis show very skinny CAPE, not supportive of much more
than brief heavy rain, very small hail, and erratic winds, and the
occasional lightning strike.

The upper level low driving this activity will move east of the
area overnight. Quick on its heels, another low pressure system
will dig south from the BC coast down to the coast of southern
Oregon Wednesday and Thursday, supporting yet more shower and
isolated thunder potential. The low is then expected to lift
northeast Friday into Saturday, with wrap-around showers
continuing through this period. In all, it`s unlikely that there
will be any period that will be completely dry across western
Washington between now and Saturday.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...By Sunday through the first
part of next week, confidence in the details falls off. Consensus
indicates roughly zonal flow, keeping temperatures cool, but
resulting in longer breaks between shower activity. Looking out a
bit further, long range outlooks show the potential for ridging to
develop leading to dry conditions and temperatures rising to near
or above normal once again.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mainly VFR to MVFR in scattered showers. Activity will
continue to spread inland throughout the afternoon and evening, with
a low (15% to 25%) chance of isolated thunderstorm activity.
Confidence not high enough to include in any TAFs. Shower activity
will taper off by 21/07z with onshore flow allowing for MVFR to IFR
stratus ceilings to spread inland early Wednesday morning. Winds
generally S/SW 10 kt or less.

KSEA...VFR through the evening with scattered showers and isolated
thunder activity. Brief periods of MVFR possible in heavier showers.
Precip will clear out by 21/03z with MVFR ceilings developing
Wednesday morning with another marine stratus push. Winds generally
S/SW 10 kt or less. 15<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure offshore will gradually weaken today and
push inland. Winds 10-20 kt over the coastal waters will gradually
ease through the day today. Isolated thunderstorms are possible
throughout the day today and could bring gusty winds and low
visibilities to portions of the area waters at times. Another low
will drop down into the region mid to late week and bring a weak
front to the coastal waters. Additional systems will move into the
area waters over the weekend, bringing increased onshore flow to the
area and the potential for stronger westerly pushes through the
Strait of Juan de Fuca. Wave heights will generally range between 3-
6 ft over the next several days. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
