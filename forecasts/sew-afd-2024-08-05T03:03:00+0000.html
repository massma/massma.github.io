Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
803 PM PDT Sun Aug 4 2024

.SYNOPSIS...High pressure aloft to start the week with continued
above normal temperatures and dry weather. However, increased
onshore flow will bring near-normal conditions on Tuesday before
warming up shortly afterwards. Nearby disturbances may usher
marginal thunderstorm potential over the Cascades towards the
second half of the week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Clear skies over much of W
WA this evening as per current satellite imagery. Most obs reporting
nearly identical temperatures to yesterday although Shelton and Port
Townsend are reporting 2-3 degrees cooler while Bellingham is
around 6 degrees warmer. Some lingering marine stratus along the
coastline is expected to make another limited incursion inland
overnight tonight, but likely only getting as far as Bremerton and
Olympia. Otherwise, only worthwhile features on both satellite and
radar are some pretty active thunderstorms down in northern OR that
continue to move northeastward, well out and away from the CWA.

Inherited forecast remains on track. No need for any evening
updates. For further forecast details, please refer to the Previous
Discussion section below.

From Previous Discussion...Overall little change in the forecast
pattern: A large upper level ridge centered over the Four Corners
continues to be the driving mechanism for this week`s weather.
Marine stratus has largely burned off except for along the immediate
coast, with temperatures across the region ranging from the mid 60s
to the low 80s as of X. An upper level trough sitting just offshore
will move across western Washington tomorrow night into Tuesday.
Monday will be a touch cooler than today, with highs in the mid 70s
to low 80s. Onshore flow will increase as the trough moves through
on Tuesday, allowing temperatures to dip down closer to normal, in
the upper 70s to around 80. As the trough departs on Wednesday,
temperatures will warm back up into mid 70s to mid 80s as before.
The marine stratus layer will continue to be a feature across the
area each morning, with low temperatures in the 50s to low 60s.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...From Previous
Discussion...Deterministic and ensemble guidance indicates continued
above average temperatures, with highs rising into the upper 80s to
low 90s by the end of the week and into next weekend. Flow aloft
becomes zonal as a trough retrogrades through the Canadian Prairies.
Another trough then develops Friday into the weekend over Alberta/BC
and extends down into the region. These features will promote the
potential for elevated convection each afternoon over the Cascades
(in particular the North Cascades towards the Canadian border), with
up to a 15-25% chance for showers and thunderstorms.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>From Previous Discussion...Southwest flow aloft
continues through Monday across Western Washington. Onshore low-
level flow will persist but VFR under clear skies through evening
for most. The exception again remains IFR stratus along the
immediate coastline. Expect another push of marine stratus to bring
widespread IFR ceilings into the interior by daybreak Monday lasting
through mid to late morning.

KSEA...VFR conditions under clear skies. Surface winds variable but
predominantly west/northwest this evening, before returning to
southerly tonight. Speeds generally 6 kt or less through the period.
Shallow IFR stratus likely to return after 12z and linger into mid
morning Monday. Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>From Previous Discussion...A rather persistent pattern
will continue across the region through early next week with a broad
high pressure remaining offshore and lower pressure inland.
Diurnally driven increases in the westerlies through the Strait of
Juan de Fuca will reach advisory speeds this evening and
particularly tomorrow evening. This trend will likely continue each
of the next several days. Meanwhile, persistent northwest winds over
the outer coastal waters will maintain steep conditions over the
next few days with seas mostly around 6 feet. Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
