.PREV DISCUSSION... <span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>/issued 258 AM PDT Mon Oct 21 2024/

.SYNOPSIS...Showers continue today across western Washington as
an upper level disturbance crosses the region. Drier conditions in
place around midweek but some light showers linger at times.
Another active pattern with widespread precipitation likely to
return late in the week through the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...A cooler air mass is
beginning to settle in behind the passage of the cold front late
yesterday. While the main upper trough will lag offshore for
another day or so, an embedded disturbance will swing across
western Washington today and bring a focus for a round of showers
across the region. Snow levels will fall to around 5000 ft with
this moisture. With the increased instability from the cooler air
aloft, there is some slight potential (15-20%) for an isolated
thunderstorm or two as these showers swing through. The highest
chances remain from around Grays Harbor inland through the I-5
corridor stretching from around Tacoma southward. The upper
trough then swings across the area tonight through early Tuesday,
with some lingering showers becoming mostly confined to the
mountains.

Expect heights to rise a bit into Tuesday with transient high
pressure moving overhead. This will bring mostly dry conditions
and a likely decrease in cloud cover in the afternoon and into
Tuesday night. With weak high pressure and clearing skies, this
will provide for efficient radiational cooling which could bring
overnight temperatures into the mid 30s in many spots by daybreak
Wednesday. Some patchy areas of frost can`t be ruled out in some
of the typically cooler outlying locations. This will again be the
case Wednesday night, though ensemble guidance has become a bit
more split with respect to how much that high pressure can hold on
or if the region remains open to the next weak disturbance.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...While ensemble guidance
still remains a bit split with respect to the midweek period and
how quickly the weak high pressure breaks down, there is fairly
strong agreement that the next upper trough will begin to approach
the region late in the week. A deepening low in the Gulf of
Alaska will likely become the dominant upstream weather feature by
the weekend, with a leading front reaching the Pacific Northwest
by around Friday. A potentially more impactful period of weather
could follow into the weekend with ensemble guidance suggesting
another deeper plume of moisture aimed somewhere in the region
this weekend.                              Cullen

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft will become westerly tonight
as an upper level trough moves onshore. The air mass remains moist
and will become somewhat unstable this afternoon. A mix of MVFR
(mostly through the Puget Sound area terminals) and VFR ceilings
this morning will lift and break to primarily VFR away from the
coast this afternoon with shower activity increasing regionwide as
an upper level impulse swings onshore. Ceilings will deteriorate to
MVFR and IFR again tonight with scattered showers continuing across
the area. Patchy fog may be possible again early tomorrow morning in
the valleys and prone areas (including OLM, PWT). Winds remain
southerly 5 to 10 kt across the area through the TAF period.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings are expected to persist through the morning
before lifting to VFR 19Z-21Z with shower activity increasing in a
somewhat unstable air mass. Ceilings are expected to lower again
this evening to MVFR becoming low end MVFR by dawn Tuesday. Surface
winds light early this morning becoming S/SW 5 to 9 knots this
afternoon and evening.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak surface low over the coastal waters will move
onshore near the mouth of the Columbia River this afternoon. A broad
surface ridge centered well offshore will rebuild across the waters
tonight into Tuesday and largely remain in place into Thursday for
rather tranquil conditions across the waters. The ridge is then
expected to shift east of the Cascades late in the week as a broad
and potentially deep trough moves into the offshore/coastal waters
for a return to active conditions and possible headlines. Seas
remain 4 to 6 ft through most of the week.

27/LH<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Rivers will continue to recede over the next few
days. With the flow turning increasingly from the southwest
tonight, some of the slopes of the Olympics and the North Cascades
will again see the highest rainfall amounts tonight. That said,
amounts are only on the order of one half to one inch, so not
particularly hydrologically significant, and the biggest impact
may be rivers not dropping quite as fast from the higher flows.
Additional river flooding is not expected through the week ahead.
Another round of potentially heavier rainfall is possible over the
weekend, but confidence in the placement of heavy rain remains
low at this time.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
