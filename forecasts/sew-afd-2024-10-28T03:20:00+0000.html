Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
820 PM PDT Sun Oct 27 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Showery, cool conditions will continue into Monday as
an upper level trough moves onshore. Snow levels will fall to the
higher passes tonight into Monday. Briefly drier conditions will
develop Monday night and Tuesday before a vigorous frontal system
produces additional rain, mountain snow, and locally windy
conditions midweek. A trend toward somewhat drier conditions is
expected by the end of the week.

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Radar remains pretty active this evening with multiple
areas of showers. The thunder threat has diminished, but heavier
showers that get convective enough may be strong enough to produce
heavy downpours. Snow also continues to fall at higher elevations
in the Cascades and Olympics (based on cameras at Paradise and
Hurricane Ridge). More details on the forecast can be found below.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Scattered showers and
isolated thunderstorms continue across Western Washington this
afternoon as a cool, unstable post-frontal air mass spreads
onshore. Snow levels will fall to the higher passes tonight with
the best chance of impactful accumulation across the North
Cascades where a Winter Weather Advisory remains in effect through
Monday morning. Surface gradients will gradually relax on Monday
morning allowing the breezy winds to subside. The upper trough
axis will push onshore early Monday for a continuing threat of
showers through the day and high temperatures a few degrees below
seasonal averages.

Shortwave upper ridging noses into the area late Monday night
into Tuesday allowing the region to briefly dry out. A vigorous
front will reach the area on Wednesday. In addition to another
shot of rain, models are advertising a fairly strong
east/southeasterly gradient just ahead of the front for likely
windy conditions for portions of the coast and areas adjacent to
the entrances to the strait. This system will be cooler than the
previous couple with good potential to see accumulating snowfall
at all of the passes by Wednesday night.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...A vertically stacked
trough is expected to follow the front on Thursday as it digs
southeastward toward west or northwest Oregon. This will keep
showers and cool temperatures in the forecast, though the focus
for much of the QPF may be on the southern half of CWA. Ensembles
continue to show upper ridging rebuilding just offshore by the end
of the week as an upper trough digs southward into California.
About half of the ensembles have some energy spilling over the top
of the ridge into Western Washington. This eliminates the
possibility of going with a completely dry forecast for next
weekend, but one can say that the week is shaping up to end on a
drier and quieter note that it began. 27

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Widespread showers continue across the region. Still
expect a few isolated thunderstorms this evening with the best
chances near the coast and south of Puget Sound. Otherwise,
predominantly VFR conditions are expected across the region but
may be occasionally interrupted by lower ceilings and visibilities
in heavier showers. Meanwhile, gusty southerly surface winds will
continue. Little change to the pattern through the start of
Monday, with additional showers (and some potential for additional
isolated thunderstorms) continues. However, there are increased
chances for ceilings to trend lower and settle into the MVFR range
for many terminals around 12z through the morning.

KSEA...Rain showers continue with predominantly VFR ceilings
(perhaps even scattering at times in between showers), but brief
reductions in ceilings and visibility as stronger showers pass
across the terminal. Chances for seeing ceilings lower more
solidly into the MVFR range increase between 12-18z Monday.
Otherwise, winds will ease and showers eventually decrease through
the day.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Widespread showers and isolated thunderstorms continue
across the waters. This is enhancing the gusty winds across the
waters and the current small craft advisories for the interior
zones remain in effect through 11 PM. Winds also remain gusty over
the coastal waters with gusts reaching 20-30 kt at times, but the
bigger impact is the large seas. Boosted the forecast about 1-3
ft above guidance through Monday in line with current observations
and decaying the very large seas associated with a deep low
moving near Vancouver Island today. This will bring the potential
for seas again building into the 18-20 ft range over the coastal
waters, with the largest seas beyond 20 NM from shore. Rough and
very steep conditions will continue on Grays Harbor bar into
Monday as well.

The pattern will generally remain active as a strong low pressure
system sinks southward from the Gulf of Alaska and into the region
on Monday before pushing inland to the south. High pressure then
returns Tuesday, but a strong frontal system arrives by Wednesday
bringing another round of stronger winds and significantly building
seas. The probability of gales has increased to near 50% with
southeasterlies ahead of this next front, so this will need to be
closely monitored. The next Gulf of Alaska low will then follow,
maintaining very active weather conditions as seas again are likely
to build to around 15 ft.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
