Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
701 PM EST Sat Mar 9 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure tracks across the New York City Metropolitan Area
tonight and into Maine on Sunday. High pressure south of the
area will be in control Tuesday. A frontal system may stall
nearby for mid week, before lifting north as a warm front late
Thursday and Friday. Another frontal system follows on Saturday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SUNDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A stormy night is still on track across the area, as low pressure
moves over the region tonight.

Forecast models continue to be in very good agreement that a
roughly 993 low will track over or very close to NYC around 06Z.
Have stuck fairly close to the NBM POPs tonight. The best
chances for rain are this evening through at least the first
half of the overnight. After 06z, POPs start to taper off from
SW to NE, with most of the rain ending towards daybreak.

Rainfall amounts will range between 1 and 2 inches with some of
the rain falling heavy at times. After collaboration with
surrounding WFOs, have decided to expand the flood watch to
include the remainder of the Lower Hudson Valley and southern
CT. There will be a chance of flash flooding along some of the
rivers and streams across the watch area due to antecedent wet
soils and the anticipated rain totals. Across NYC and Long
Island, we are generally looking at a potential for minor/poor
drainage flooding tonight.

Winds will increase a bit tonight as the low gets closer. Expect
gusts between 35-40 mph closer to the coasts. Winds will be less
across the interior.

Lows tonight will be in the upper 30s and 40s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Not too much change in the short term period.

Sunday will be the start of a period of strong W to NW winds.
Direction will be more W on Sun, then veer to the NW Sunday
night as winds aloft also increase. The breezy conditions on Sun
will strengthen Sunday night, with 850mb winds around 50kt on
Monday. Deep mixing is likely in this pattern. Wind advisory
headlines seem likely on Monday, but its still a tad early right
now for headlines. The winds will likely keep wind chills from
getting out of the 30s.

A large upper level low passes over the region late Sunday and
Sunday night. As it does, expect some additional cloud cover.
Also, with the substantial cold pool aloft, dpva, and even some
sbcape, will continue to keep a 30 POP in the forecast. Expect a
chance a snow and rain showers. Can not rule out some ice
pellets as well. Temps fall late in the afternoon, with
dewpoints dropping into the 20s.

Temperatures on Sunday will be in the middle and upper 40s to
50s.

While Monday will feel chilly, high temperatures are expected to be
in the 40s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Key Points...

* Winds diminish Monday night into Tuesday morning...

* A warming trend takes place...

The upper level low gets further to the northeast and well up
into the Canadian Maritimes Monday night and into Tuesday
morning. This will lead to a diminishing of the winds.
Afterwards for midweek, in response to the digging and
amplification of the upstream trough over the Rockies a ridge
builds across the East. This will lead to a warming trend with
temperatures averaging well above normal for the mid and late
week period with dry conditions.

The trough will approach late in the week and likely bring
another round of unsettled weather in the form of rain late
Friday and Saturday with the arrival of low pressure and its
associated occluded / cold front. There are differences in
timing and in the handling of the Pacific branch and any
potential interaction with the pure southern branch of the jet.
Thus chose to take a consensus blend, which the NBM seemed
reasonable with respect to PoPs for Friday and Saturday.

The greatest deal of uncertainty deals with temperatures for
Wednesday through Friday. By Thursday max temperatures are
likely to get into the 60s across a good portion of the area,
particularly away from the coast. If more of a westerly
component to the wind develops closer to the surface, then
temperatures could get even warmer than currently advertised.
Some 70s therefore are a possibility away from the coast later
in the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /00Z SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Deepening low pressure over the Delmarva at 23Z Saturday will approach
from the southwest this evening, passing across the area late
tonight, around 06Z to 09Z, and then to the north and east on
Sunday.

Periods of rain, light to moderate at times, and briefly heavy,
with IFR to LIFR will continues into late tonight. Thunder
can`t be ruled out this evening, mainly for the NYC terminals,
but not confident enough to include in the TAFs.

Improvement to MVFR and then VFR expected late tonight west, and
toward Sunday morning east, with the passage of an occluded
front, and with the rain ending. There is a chance that MVFR
conditions persist late morning into the early afternoon on
Sunday. There may be some residual scattered rain or snow
showers Sunday afternoon into the evening which may result in
brief MVFR conditions.

E/SE winds 10-15 kt with gusts between 20kt and 30kt, highest
near the coast, will be diminishing late tonight, and becoming
SE to S. Winds may even become variable as the center of low
pressure passes over or near the NYC metro terminals. Winds then
become westerly toward Sunday morning with gusts developing. The
strongest winds and gusts will be late Sunday afternoon into
Sunday evening, with gusts around 35 kt possible.

LLWS, with SE winds becoming S and then SW, at 2K ft will be 45
to 55 kt, and possibly as high as 65 kt at KGON this evening.
Wind shear included in the forecast for the NYC metro and
eastern terminals. Winds shear ends as winds become westerly.


 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Amendments likely especially late tonight into Sunday morning,
to refine timing of heaviest rain, and possible flight category
changes. Isolated thunder remains possible this evening but not
confident enough to include in the TAFs.

OUTLOOK FOR 00Z MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...

Sunday night: VFR. W winds 15-20kt G25-35kt.

Monday: VFR. W/NW winds 20-25kt gusts near 35-40kt.

Monday night: VFR. NW winds near 20 kt in the evening with gusts up
to 25-30 kt, eventually decreasing to 10-15 kt with gusts 20-25kt
late.

Tuesday: VFR. NW winds 10-15G20kt.

Tuesday night through Thursday: VFR.

.MARINE...
Low pressure passing over the area  waters tonight will result in
gales on all waters except the NY Harbor and the far eastern portion
of LI sound. A Small craft advisory is in effect for those areas.
Sunday, the gales go away and will need to be replaced with Small
Craft headlines. There may be a period on the non-ocean waters where
conditions fall below SCA. However, Wind and seas increase again
Sunday night into Monday. Gale watches remain in effect for all
waters on Monday. Ocean seas will will remain 8-10 ft tonight
through Monday.

Gales will give way to small craft conditions Monday night as the
winds begin to diminish. Any small craft conditions early on Tuesday
should give way to sub small craft conditions for late Tuesday. More
tranquil conditions are expected towards Wednesday and much of
Thursday with light winds and ocean seas closer to 2 ft.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
Around 1 to 2 inches of rain is expected to fall this afternoon
through tonight. The higher amounts are expected to be north and
west of NYC. There will be the chance of flash flooding, primarily
along the smaller rivers and streams due to antecedent wet
soils and the anticipated rain totals. The heaviest rainfall is
expected this evening into the early morning hours of Sunday.
Otherwise, mainly minor/poor drainage flooding will be possible
tonight.

There are no hydrologic concerns Sunday night through next week.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
Strengthening SE flow with gale force wind gusts on the coastal
waters tonight will coincide with high astronomical tides, in some
cases producing departures of 2-3 ft above astronomical tides. This
will result in widespread minor and moderate coastal flooding during
the times of high tide tonight and Sunday morning.

For tonight: Per bias-corrected Stevens 50th percentile guidance
have issued a coastal flood warning for S Nassau and SW Suffolk for
tonight, and upgraded the watch to a warning for S
Fairfield/Westchester/Bronx/N Queens/N Nassau, all of which should
see a long enough period of strong SE winds to push water levels
above moderate thresholds. Strong onshore flow and associated wave
action will likely exacerbate problems along the coast of S
Fairfield as seas in the western Sound just offshore reach 3-4 ft
around the time of high tide.

Replaced the coastal flood watch with an advisory for NW Suffolk,
where guidance predicts water levels to approach moderate thresholds
in some spots , but where offshore flow may have some mitigating
influence.

Coastal flood advisories are in effect for all other waters. A river
flood advisory (FLS) will also be issued for the Hudson for Rockland
and N Westchester where minor coastal flood impacts are also
expected this evening.

For Sunday morning: Still have concern that strong SE flow followed
by strong SW-W flow will result in water remaining trapped in the
Long Island south shore bays, which would then slosh eastward into
the Great South Bay, and that water levels elsewhere will be higher
than than the Stevens 50th percentile. Took a 2:1 blend of the
Stevens 95th and 50th percentile forecasts, and nudged that toward
PETSS 50th percentile guidance on the Long Island south shore bays
where higher.

This forecast results in moderate flooding for Jamaica Bay (S Queens
portion) and another round for S Nassau, so a coastal flood warning
was issued for both areas for Sunday morning. Water levels farther
east into the Great South Bay should at least reach minor thresholds
due to water sloshing eastward. Minor flooding also expected on all
other remaining coastlines including the lower Hudson.

For the oceanfront, a forecast 8-11 ft surf (highest east across
Suffolk County) will likely cause scattered dune erosion Sunday
morning.
