Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
735 PM EDT Wed Sep 25 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure across the Northeast continues to weaken and
slowly giving way to a frontal system that will move across the
area Thursday into Thursday night. High pressure will then
gradually build in from the north on Friday and remain across
the region Friday night through Monday as weakening low pressure
tracks to the south. Another frontal system approaches Tuesday
with a cold front passing through Wednesday.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM THURSDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Forecast mainly on track. Only minor changes to the
probabilities this evening, and increased sky cover.

A warm front approaches from the west and may enter the western
zones by daybreak. Best thermal forcing/higher chances of
showers will be north and west of NYC. Models show elevated
instability moving in late at night, but thinking is that lift
will be too weak for a mention of thunder. Low temperatures
mostly in the 60s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM THURSDAY MORNING THROUGH FRIDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The warm front lifts across the forecast area during Thursday
with a trailing cold front slowly passing through on Thursday
night. The highest chances of showers during the daytime remain
north and west where the stronger upward forcing will be.
Chances then increase for the rest of the region at night as the
cold front shifts through. Have left in a slight chance of
thunder during the daytime and evening with increased
instability. Still some uncertainty regarding how far south and
east the likelihood of showers and potentially brief heavy
downpours reach as instability wanes along the slow- moving cold
front. With that said, no concerns for severe thunderstorms or
flooding for this event. Some post-frontal showers are possible
Friday morning across the southern zones, otherwise dry but
mostly cloudy conditions. Clouds may however thin out to partial
sunshine for the northern zones. NBM looked good for
temperatures through the short term.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper ridge along the east coast will remain in place Friday
night into the beginning of next week as a closed low remain
offshore of the northeast coast, and another weakening closed
low continues to meander across the lower Mississippi Valley.
This low gradually weakens into an open trough Monday.
Meanwhile, at the surface high pressure builds into the
northeast Friday night into Saturday and remains into the
beginning of next week. With low pressure meandering to the
south this is a chance of precipitation mainly across the
southwestern areas Friday night into Saturday night. Then with
the high pressure nosing into the region dry weather is expected
Sunday and Monday. However, there is uncertainty with the
strength of the high and where the low tracks, and Friday night
into Saturday may end up dry, and Sunday and Monday may be wet.
By Monday night the southern low is really weak or dissipated,
and any remnants will be picked up by another northern stream
frontal system moving to the north Tuesday into Wednesday, with
the systems cold front, at this time, expected to pass through
the region Wednesday.

Temperatures will be generally seasonable through the extended
period.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /00Z THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure gradually weakens as a frontal system approaches into
tonight. The frontal system moves through the area on Thursday
into Thursday night.

Cigs lower to IFR for the NYC terminals, KHPN and KSWF tonight.
Likely don`t fall below MVFR at the remaining terminals, but
cannot completely rule out IFR. Slow return to MVFR by late
morning, but cigs may hang near or under 3 kft much of the day.
Brief improvement to VFR is possible late in the day for KJFK,
KLGA and KEWR.

Scattered showers move through intermittently into early this
evening. Western terminals (KSWF, KHPN) expected to have higher
likelihood of more widespread SHRA activity, while KBDR and
KGON may remain mostly dry. Additional showers, with potential
thunderstorms, persist through the day Thursday, though timing
and coverage is low confidence at this point. Highest chance for
thunder is at KSWF, where PROB30 was introduced after 16Z Thu.

Winds gradually shift southerly overnight into Thursday
morning. Similar speeds on Thursday, 10-12 kt gusting to about
20.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Unscheduled amendments likely for changing flight categories due to
timing of cigs and presence of -SHRA through TAF period.

Brief window of VFR is possible late Thursday afternoon at KJFK,
LGA and KEWR.

OUTLOOK FOR 00Z FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY...

Thursday PM: MVFR or lower with showers/thunderstorms at times.

Friday: MVFR or lower in the early AM with low stratus,
becoming VFR by late morning.

Saturday: Possible MVFR in slight chance of -SHRA

Sunday-Monday: VFR.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No changes to winds and seas at this time. Only minor changes to
chances for showers early this evening.

Long period easterly swells from a slowly departing offshore
low will to continue to produce advisory- level waves on the
ocean through tonight. While 5 ft waves are still possible
mainly in the morning on Thursday, do not have enough confidence
that they would occur across enough of any one particular zone
to extend the SCA into Thursday. Waves otherwise prevail just
below advisory thresholds on the ocean through Friday with gusts
below 25 kt on all waters. Winds and seas across the forecast
waters remain below advisory levels Friday night through Monday
night as high pressure remains in control.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
There are no hydrologic concerns through the middle of next
week.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
A high risk for the development of rip currents continues through
Thursday due to continued long period easterly swells.
Swells begin to slowly diminish Friday and Saturday. The rip current
risk is expected to also diminish to moderate for Friday.

&&

.OKX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CT...None.
NY...High Risk for Rip Currents through Thursday evening for NYZ075-080-
     081-178-179.
NJ...None.
MARINE...Small Craft Advisory until 6 AM EDT Thursday for ANZ350-353-
     355.
