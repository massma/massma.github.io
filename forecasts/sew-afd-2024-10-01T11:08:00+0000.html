Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
408 AM PDT Tue Oct 1 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Dissipating front moving through the northern portion
of Western Washington this afternoon. Weak upper level trough
behind the front for tonight and Wednesday. Temporary weak upper
level ridge Wednesday night and Thursday before a more organized
front arrives Friday. Weak upper level ridge trying to build for
the weekend into the first part of next week but the ridge does
not look strong enough to prevent weak systems from moving by just
to the north.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
middle level cloud deck over the Northwest Interior with mostly
clear skies over the remainder of the area. Temperatures at 3
am/10z were in the 40s and lower 50s.

Weakening front moving down the British Columbia coast this
morning will move through the northern portion of the forecast
area this afternoon. Front currently still north of Vancouver
Island with the leading edge of the clouds out ahead of the front
near Tofino at 10z. Middle level clouds spreading over the area
from north to south later this morning into this afternoon. Rain
likely over the Northwest Interior and North Coast later this
morning into the afternoon hours with a chance of rain from about
Olympia northward later this afternoon. Flow aloft west
northwesterly providing a bit of a rain shadow for the Seattle
area. With sunshine this morning temperatures over the Southwest
Interior reaching the lower 70s this afternoon. In the Northwest
Interior temperatures will only get into the lower 60s with highs
occurring in the middle of the day.

Weak post front troughiness will keep the threat of showers going
in the evening hours over mostly the Cascades and Cascade
foothills. Any shower activity that does develop will produce
light precipitation. Skies clearing a little after midnight with
lows dropping into the 40s.

Weak shortwave riding by to the north Wednesday for a slight
chance of showers near the Canadian border and along the North
Coast. For the remainder of the area varying degrees of cloud
cover. Highs in the lower to mid 60s.

Weak upper level ridge building over Western Washington Wednesday
night with the ridge shifting slightly east Thursday. Skies
clearing with the weak subsidence associated with the ridge.
Surface gradients light overnight with areas of fog forming in the
favored locations like the Southwest Interior and interior river
valley early Thursday morning. Even with the mostly sunny skies
Thursday temperatures aloft are not very warm. Highs near or
slightly below normal, in the upper 50s to mid 60s. Lows Thursday
morning on the cool side with the colder locations getting into
the upper 30s.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Models in good agreement with
a much more organized front arriving Friday spreading rain over
the area. Front to the east Friday night with a weak upper level
ridge trying to build over the area. Both the operational GFS and
ECMWF build the ridge into the upper 570 and lower 580 dms range
over the weekend. The ensemble solutions are not as aggressive
with the ridge building. A weaker ridge will allow systems moving
by to the north to brush Western Washington at times. Current
ensemble solutions indicate the best chance of some light
precipitation would be late in the weekend into Monday. Highs in
the upper 50s to mid 60s Friday and mostly 60s and lower 70s
Saturday through Monday. Still no signs of a true fall weather
pattern setting up even in the models out to 10 days. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Flow aloft will continue to remain westerly with
northerly offshore low level flow. All stations are reporting VFR
early this morning. An approaching weak cold front has been able to
produce high clouds (visible on Satellite with best coverage west of
I-5). Terminals that get in on the high cloud coverage will continue
to see VFR through the morning. However clear areas may see patchy
fog develop briefly this morning. A weak cold front will bring light
showers this afternoon, primarily in northern terminals (Bellingham
to Port Angeles). Some of the lighter showers may linger southward
into the South Interior. Surface winds are light (and in some areas
variable out of the north/east this morning), but will pick up out
of the west and northwest later today.

KSEA...VFR this morning, with increasing mid and high level clouds
arriving. Light showers possible Tuesday afternoon with no impacts
expected. Light/variable winds ahead of the front this morning
(primarily out of the south) will transition to west/northwest winds
6 to 10 kt later in the day.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak cold front will continue to advance eastward,
weakening as it comes ashore. Light showers are possible over
northern waters, but are not expected to produce impacts. Seas will
be the main issue (due to low pressure north of the area). These
will range from 9 to 14 feet, beginning in the northern outer
coastal waters, and spreading to all zones Tuesday afternoon,
lasting through all of Wednesday into Wednesday night/Thursday
morning. Onshore flow will pick up behind the front, with gusty
winds reaching the central/east Strait of Juan de Fuca late Tuesday
night/Wednesday morning. Inherited small craft advisories for the
seas/winds continue with no changes.

The flow will become more northerly Thursday with riding building in
southern British Columbia. Another disturbance is possible Friday
but predictability of hazards are too low at this time. Seas will
drop gradually down to 4 to 6 feet Thursday/Friday, building back to
5 to 7 feet towards the end of the week.
