Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
252 PM PST Mon Jan 6 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge will build offshore for drier
conditions across the area into Tuesday. A weak front will move
over the region into Wednesday with mostly dry conditions into
Thursday. A more organized system will move through on Friday
with lowland rain and mountain snow. Another weak ridge looks to
build over the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Recent satellite imagery
this afternoon shows low clouds persisting across the Puget Sound
area, throughout much of the lowlands. High temperatures this
afternoon in the mid to upper 40s. If you want sun, go to the
mountains! Low cloud cover looks to hang on for the rest of the
day. An upper level ridge will remain over western Washington
tonight with northerly flow aloft. Fog will likely redevelop again
into Tuesday morning, with temperatures tonight dropping around
the freezing mark in most places. Morning fog and low cloud layer
will likely be more shallow than this morning, with a quicker lift
expected across the area and mid to high level clouds streaming
in.

The aforementioned upper level ridge will shift eastward briefly
as a weakening front approaches the area on Wednesday. This front
will practically fall apart as it passes over western Washington,
with the North Coast and the North Interior the most likely
places to receive any rain, with the Cascades and the Olympics
receiving light snow.

Another upper level ridge will rebuild offshore for mostly dry
conditions into Thursday.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Ensemble guidance continues
to agree in a more organized frontal system entering the area on
Friday. With snow levels hovering around 4000 feet, can expect
another round of high elevation mountain snow, lowland rain, and
breezy conditions on Friday. Extended models rebuild another
upper level ridge through the weekend for overall more drier
conditions. There may be a few shortwaves riding the NE periphery
of the ridge for some showers here and there, but conditions
generally look dry into the first half of next week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge offshore will push inland tonight
and flatten somewhat into Tuesday, allowing for northerly flow
aloft to become more westerly by Tuesday morning. Satellite
imagery this afternoon still shows low stratus and fog persisting
across portions of the central and south Sound. While areas of
stratus and fog have started to scatter in spots, improvement has
been slow. There`s still a chance areas across the central Sound
will break out by late this afternoon, however low clouds do look
to stick around through the rest of the day for terminals across
the south Sound and Southwest Interior. Conditions at area terminals
are a mixed bag as a result, with areas scattering seeing improvement
to MVFR/VFR this afternoon and areas in clouds continuing to see
IFR/LIFR conditions.

High cloud cover will start to move into the area tonight and may
help mitigate additional fog development in some spots. However,
with ample low level moisture and winds easing overnight- and
some places not scattering out at all - it`s likely that another
round of fog/low clouds will be present for the interior terminals
Tuesday morning. IFR to LIFR conditions will be likely again for
terminals in fog, with conditions expected to lift around 20-22Z.
A weak dissipating frontal system will also start to bring some
shower activity to the coast between 19-21Z. Showers then look to
move inland between 00-06Z Weds.

KSEA...IFR with low stratus. Latest satellite trend has some
scattering in the vicinity of the terminal, so could still see an
improvement towards VFR late this afternoon. Winds generally
persisting out of the NW at 7-10 kts. Winds will ease to 4-7 kt
overnight and shift to the N/NE. NBM probabilistic guidance shows
a 25-30 percent chance of LIFR conditions redeveloping by Tuesday
morning. Fog that does develop looks to scatter by 20-22Z. Light
showers will be possible late Tuesday afternoon into evening. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strengthening surface ridge will remain in place
across southern BC and NE Washington into Tuesday which will
continue to promote low level offshore flow. Easterly winds will
be gusty to 25 kt at times for portions of the western Strait of
Juan de Fuca and for portions of the coastal waters tonight into
Tuesday. Winds will then turn more south/southeasterly Tuesday
afternoon ahead of a weak front. This dissipating frontal system
will move into the area waters Tuesday night into Wednesday,
producing little impact. High pressure will then build back into
the region Thursday before a stronger frontal system moves across
the area waters on Friday. High pressure then looks to slowly
rebuild across the region in its wake over the weekend.

A long period westerly swell has moved into the coastal waters
this morning and is slowly becoming the dominant wave group. Seas
will persist between 8-10 feet and look to briefly subside again
early Tuesday, before building back towards 10-12 feet Tuesday
afternoon and evening. Seas then look to subside Wednesday and
Thursday, before increasing towards 14-17 ft on Friday as another
long period wave group arrives. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
