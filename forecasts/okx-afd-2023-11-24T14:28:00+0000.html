Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
928 AM EST Fri Nov 24 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front moves through the area this afternoon into the
early evening. High pressure then builds in through Saturday and
moves offshore Saturday night. Deepening low pressure moves
along the Mid Atlantic coast Sunday, and impacts the region
Sunday night into Monday. High pressure gradually builds back in
through the middle of next week, and weakens late in the week
as low pressure passes to the north.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Stratocu deck continues to decrease in coverage this morning,
but still some clouds left along the south shore of Long Island
into NE NJ. These should continue to diminish in the next few
hours with some high clouds streaming up from the south through
the afternoon. Temperatures have also been running a bit
warmer, so have adjusted highs up a few degrees, especially in
the normally warmer locations. Highs today will be in the middle
to upper 40s with some locations touching 50 degrees.

Otherwise, a large upper vortex tracking across eastern Canada
will send a cold front through the area this afternoon. The cold
front is currently analyzed just NW of Orange County and runs
into north central PA. The front will pass through dry, but will
mark the beginning of the coldest air mass of Fall 2023.

With modest cold advection, temperatures begin dropping behind
the front and good mixing allows for some 25 mph gusts. Gusts
will be more likely over eastern portions of the area where
there will be a slightly tighter pressure gradient and stronger
winds to mix down, specifically at coastal locations where warm
waters will aid in mixing. High pressure builds in behind the
departing front tonight leading to the coldest night of the
season, with the whole area (including NYC) seeing a freeze.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
High pressure remains in control through most of the weekend. A cold
airmass with 925mb temperatures on Saturday -5C to -8C will keep
highs in the upper 30s to low 40s. High pressure shifts offshore
Saturday night and a very light return flow sets up. With winds
being so light, the southwesterly flow should not affect
radiational cooling too much, however, there may be some clouds
around. Current forecast has lows a few degrees warmer than
Friday night.

High pressure shifts farther offshore on Sunday and surface low
pressure and associated mid-level trough approach from the west
while a deepening coastal low approaches from the south. Much of
Sunday will likely be dry, but introduced slight chance PoPs at
the very end of the Sunday day period. Went a bit higher than
NBM given latest deterministic guidance, but it is very possible
any rain holds off till Sunday night.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The long term period remains mostly consistent with previous
forecast, with the amplifying northern stream trough phasing
with a souther stream shortwave, Sunday night into Monday. Minor
changes have the northern stream trough amplifying more than
previous forecast, which then keeps the southern shortwave a
little farther to the south, and then southeast of the area by
Monday morning. However, precipitation does move into the region
quickly early Sunday evening. And with the progression of the
upper flow the low quickly tracks to the east and northeast
Monday with the precipitation ending across the region by the
afternoon. Temperatures will be slightly above normal and an all
liquid event is expected across the forecast region. With
strong cold air advection in the wake of the low Monday, and
strong winds aloft, gusty winds are expected, started the gusts
earlier than the previous forecast, and and with the
possibility of gusts as high as 30kt have used the NBM the
percentile for gusts, which is a few knots higher than the NBM.
Deep cyclonic flow continues into Tuesday with a strong pressure
gradient and gusty winds will continue Tuesday, and again used
the NBM the percentile for gusts. High pressure builds
Wednesday and winds and gusts will not be as strong.

Monday night temperatures will be a few degrees below normal,
however, as the colder air moves in temperatures Tuesday through
Wednesday will be around 10 degrees below normal levels. The
NBM seems to have captured the colder air and the NBM was used
for highs and lows.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /14Z FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure builds in from the west as a dry cold front
passes through the terminals early this afternoon.

VFR. Clouds have scattered out though for most of the terminals
there is still some intermittent BKN040 across the city
terminals. These should continue to scatter out further into the
afternoon.

NW winds are now beginning to gust across KSWF to 20-25kts, and
so have bumped up the gust onset at the NYC terminals a few
hours. Gusts may begin even an hour or so earlier than currently
forecast should the trend continue.


 ...NY Metro(KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

No unscheduled AMD expected. NW gust onset may occur an hour
earlier than forecast.

OUTLOOK FOR 12Z SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...

Sat: VFR.

Sun: VFR. MVFR possible late in the day with rain. MVFR with rain
Sunday night. SE wind 15-20kt, G25-30kt, becoming SW and diminishing
toward morning.

Mon: VFR at the NYC metro terminals and northwest. A chance of rain
early east with MVFR, then becoming VFR. WNW wind 15-20kt, G25-30kt.

Tue: VFR. W wind 15-20kt, G25-30kt.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Winds will begin to increase on the waters today, but should
remain below 25 kt until tonight behind a cold front passage.
There is higher confidence in 25 kt gusts over the ocean,
eastern Sound and Peconic and Gardiners Bays, but 25 kt gusts
are possible on all waters and have issued a Small Craft
Advisory for tonight. Sub-SCA conditions are then expected
Saturday through Sunday as high pressure builds into the area
and remains in control.

With deepening low pressure passing through the forecast waters
Sunday night and then to the northeast Monday SCA conditions will be
developing on the forecast waters Sunday night. There is a chance of
minimal gale gusts on the ocean waters east of Fire Island Inlet,
and the eastern Long Island Sound late Sunday night into Monday
morning. With a strong and gusty west to northwest flow continuing
into Tuesday SCA conditions continue on most of the non ocean
waters, with gale gusts on the ocean waters and eastern Long Island
Sound redeveloping late Monday and continuing into Tuesday. With
high pressure building into the waters small craft conditions will
be diminishing west to east Tuesday night on the non ocean waters,
with SCA conditions continuing on the ocean Wednesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...
