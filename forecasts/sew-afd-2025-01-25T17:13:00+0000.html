Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
913 AM PST Sat Jan 25 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Offshore upper-level ridge building into Northern
British Columbia over the weekend with the ridge moving directly
over Western Washington Monday and Tuesday. Rain and mountain snow
returns on Thursday as the ridge exits east.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No updates planned this
morning. 50th percentile NBM guidance was unsurprisingly too warm
for a number of outlying areas overnight. Will likely lean colder
for tonight`s forecast and that will prompt some consideration for
cold weather advisories in outlying forecast zones. More on that
later. Previous discussion follows with updates to marine and
aviation discussions. 27

High pressure remains dominant over the Pac NW leading to more
dry/stable conditions this weekend and into early next week. Expect
cold temperatures in the 20s and 30s each morning. Highs will reach
the mid 40s with plenty of sunshine. 33

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...More of the same moving
through the first half of the week as the ridge slides inland. The
air mass is a little warmer with high temperatures in the mid/upper
40s to around 50. Offshore winds keep us cloud free. Morning lows
are still chilly and in the 20s to lower 30s.

The pattern changes on Thursday as a trough kicks the ridge east
and farther inland. A frontal system will spread rain inland for a
shot of rain across the region. A flip to onshore flow will keep
us warmer (overnight) with temperatures remaining above freezing.
Weak troughing keeps showers in the forecast as we move into
Friday with a few inches of snow in the mountains. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northerly flow aloft shifting more northeasterly
throughout the day due to the interplay between upper level ridging
over the Pacific and an upper trough over central California. At the
surface, locations that are not reporting light and variable winds
seeing easterly flow with variations to the northeast or southeast
depending on location/terrain with speeds generally falling within 4-
8 kts, although isolated bursts of 8-12 kts have been observed at
SEA and BLI. The exception to all of this is CLM thanks to influence
from the Strait, with westerly to southwesterly winds. By late
morning, directions should turn mostly north to northeasterly with
speeds generally 4-8 kts.

Mostly VFR conditions in place for most terminals continuing into at
least during the early morning hours Sunday.

KSEA...VFR throughout the period with north winds continuing. Wind
speed will generally be between 7 and 10 kts through much of the day
today, easing after 03Z, ranging 4 to 8 kts.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface ridging strengthens over interior British
Columbia and east of the Cascades today while a broad surface trough
deepens well to the south over California. This will lead to
northerly or weak offshore flow. This general pattern remains in
place into early next week. The next front will approach the coastal
waters around the middle of next week.

Seas 5 to 7 ft easing slightly to 4 to 6 ft by late morning and
remaining that way for much of the weekend. Seas will ease further,
down to 3 to 5 ft, Monday and remain that way into the middle of
next week, rising again ahead of the aforementioned front.
