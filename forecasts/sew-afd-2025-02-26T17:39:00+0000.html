Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
939 AM PST Wed Feb 26 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Drier and warmer conditions are expected today with
upper level ridging over the region. A weak front will approach
the region on Thursday and weaken over the area, bringing some
light showers to western Washington. Conditions then look to dry
out again on Friday before chances of precipitation return for the
weekend and persist into early next week.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows some
mid to high cloud cover streaming in across western Washington early
this morning. Overall, expect drier and warmer conditions for
western Washington today with upper level ridging over the region.
Areas of fog will lift and scatter by the mid to late morning
hours. Afternoon high temperatures will warm into the mid to upper
50s across the area- with some spots even having the potential to
hit 60 today.

A splitting frontal system approaching the region late tonight
into Thursday will bring the return of rain chances mainly for
areas along the Olympic Peninsula, the San Juans, and the Northern
Interior. With the front breaking up over the area, expect any
precipitation to remain rather light - and for totals to only be
a few hundredths of an inch. Afternoon high temperatures on
Thursday may increase a degree or two for most spots to top out
in the mid 50s to low 60s. Meanwhile, overnight lows will be in
the mid 30s to low 40s.

Upper level ridging will then return on Friday for another dry
and warm day across western Washington. Temperatures will be
similar to Thursday`s, with highs looking to top out in the upper
50s to low 60s and with lows generally expected to be in the mid
30s to low 40s.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...There remains some
uncertainty in just how the pattern shapes up over the weekend,
however the upper level ridge situated over the region does look
to push inland somewhat on Saturday. Latest guidance hints at an
incoming upper level trough over the Pacific splitting off from
the main flow and pushing into California Sunday into Monday.
Should this be the case, some wrap around moisture from the low
may push back up into western Washington over the weekend and into
early next week and bring the return of precipitation to the
area. At this time, overall precipitation amounts look to remain
rather light, with no significant weather impacts expected through
the long term. Temperatures generally look to cool a couple
degrees, with highs expected to be in the low to mid 50s and
overnight lows to be in the upper 30s to mid 40s. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak upper ridge axis remains over the region
today with westerly flow aloft. The flow aloft will become
southwesterly tonight as a dissipating frontal system approaches the
area. The low level flow is offshore. Patchy LIFR fog across south
Puget Sound and the Southwest Interior will give way to VFR areawide
this afternoon. High and mid level moisture will increase later
today into tonight ahead of the weakening front. The high level
moisture will limit development of low clouds tonight.

KSEA...VFR with increasing high level moisture later today. Surface
winds northeasterly 5 to 7 knots backing to E/SE near or after 00Z.

.MARINE...High pressure over the waters will weaken Wednesday
afternoon, as a weak frontal system moves across the offshore waters
late Wednesday night into Thursday morning. High pressure will
rebuild Thursday afternoon in the wake of the front`s passing, but
will weaken on Friday as another frontal system is expected to move
across the coastal waters into the weekend.

Combined seas will remain elevated at 10-13 ft as the frontal system
moves over the waters Wednesday night and Thursday morning. Seas
will gradually subside throughout Thursday afternoon/evening and by
Friday look to be below 10 ft. Waves will build above 10 ft into the
weekend.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A flood warning remains in effect for the Chehalis
River at Grand Mound in Thurston County as the precipitation from
earlier this week should be enough to push the river barely up to
minor flood stage later this morning through Thursday. A flood
warning also remains in effect for the Skokomish River near Potlatch
in Mason county. The river crested in moderate flood stage but is
back down to minor flood stage and will continue to recede over the
next few days. A flood watch remains in effect for Grays Harbor
county as rises continue along additional points of the Chehalis
River. 14/JBB<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
