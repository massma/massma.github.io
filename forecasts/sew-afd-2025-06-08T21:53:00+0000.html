.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge over the region will bring warm

day starting Monday night. A trough will approach the coast on

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Latest satellite imagery
shows clear skies across Western Washington on this warm afternoon.
An upper level ridge over the region will bring very warm
temperatures today and Monday. Temperatures this afternoon on the
coast are expected to peak into the 70s, while temperatures along
the interior are expected to peak around the 80s to low 90s.
Overnight relief will be limited, as low temperatures will only drop
down into the upper 50s to low 60s. The ridge will gradually weaken
on Monday and daytime temperatures will be a couple degrees
cooler. High temperatures along the coast will be in the 60s,
while interior temperatures will be in the mid 70s to 80s. A Heat
Advisory remains in effect through Monday night.

A cooling trend begins Monday night. The upper level ridge
will push out of the region on Tuesday. A trough will approach
the coast on Wednesday, but will remain offshore.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Temperatures will gradually
continue to cool into the weekend. A troughing pattern is favored
Thursday into the weekend. Models do hint at seeing some light
showers, primarily along the northern Cascades and Olympic
Peninsula. At this time QPF amounts are minimal and PoPs are
generally 20% or less. Otherwise, increased cloud cover and
generally dry conditions with this troughing pattern. 29<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest flow will transition more westerly into Monday
with an upper ridge over the area. Mostly clear skies into Monday.
There is a slight chance for LIFR stratus to develop along the
immediate coast tonight, but confidence is low. N/NW surface winds
will continue into this evening before winds become lighter tonight.
Winds will increase N/NW again midday Monday.

KSEA...Clear skies during the TAF period. N/NW surface winds of 7 to
12 kts will continue through this evening, before transitioning to
the N/NE at 5 to 8 kts tonight. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will remain over the Coastal Waters into
Wednesday. Northerly diurnal driven winds will continue over the
interior through Monday. Winds will transition more onshore later
Tuesday, with increasing onshore flow on Wednesday. An onshore flow
pattern will then continue through later this week.

A Small Craft Advisory is in effect from this evening through Monday
night due to increased northerly winds across the outer Coastal
Waters. In addition, seas of 5 to 7 feet will build to 8 to 12 feet
on Monday and continue to remain elevated through midweek.
Additional headlines are possible each evening beginning Tuesday
through the central and eastern portions of the Strait of Juan de
Fuca due to increased west winds. We will also have to monitor the
potential for any gale force winds for the Strait of Juan de Fuca
midweek with the increased onshore flow. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.FIRE WEATHER...Warm and dry conditions will continue through Monday
as an upper level ridge moves across western Washington. This will
elevate fire weather concerns today and Monday as minimum RH values
will likely reach as low as 20-30% over the mountains with slightly
higher values through the interior. While live fuels are still wet
enough to curb fire spread, dead fuels remain very dry. In addition,
snowpack is below normal and some locations are experiencing drought
conditions. Winds remain light enough into Monday such that critical
fire weather conditions are not expected but the area is drying out
fast. Moist onshore flow will return Monday night into Tuesday.
