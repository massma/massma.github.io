Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
440 AM PDT Sun Oct 20 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An atmospheric river continues to bring moderate to
localized heavy rainfall across portions of Western Washington. A
front will move across the area on Sunday, bringing another round
of breezy winds and heavier rain to the region. Expect additional
showers and cooler conditions Monday as an upper trough pushes
east across the region. Drier conditions develop toward midweek,
but rain returns late in the week as a more active pattern
returns.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The plume of moisture that
has been responsible for heavy rainfall across the northwestern
portions of the area (and even more so north of the border)
remains draped in place across the region. Rainfall rates have
diminished a bit early this morning across the local area as the
stronger moisture transport has again shifted north. However,
expect the cold front to move inland across Western Washington
later today as the surface low then approaches. This will bring
another round of steadier rain, likely around 1-2" in the
mountains and around 0.50-1.00" in the lowlands. This will
maintain elevated flows on some local rivers, especially those
draining from the Olympic Peninsula and the North Cascades. See
the Hydrology section for additional details.

One other note for the areas along the Pacific coast - higher than
average high tides have lead to water levels near minor coastal
flooding thresholds at La Push and Westport the last few days, and
there`s some concern that we`ll have one more day today with the
afternoon high tide of again approaching or reaching criteria.
While the astronomical tide is slightly lower today than
yesterday, lower pressure and higher surge contributions may keep

In addition to the rain, we`ll also see another round of gusty
winds ahead of the front. The wind advisory remains unchanged for
the northern coast as well as areas around Admiralty Inlet north
through the San Juan Islands and western Whatcom and Skagit
counties. Wind gusts may reach 40-45 mph for a few hours in
southerly winds ahead of the front in these locations. This may be
sufficient to again bring some localized power outages or damage
to trees as the winds push through. Elsewhere, impacts are
expected to be much more spotty at most, but winds will remain
breezy across the region again today. The front will push inland
and east of the Cascades late today, with a likely Puget Sound
Convergence Zone forming into the evening. This may also be
accompanied by a push of westerly winds through the Strait of Juan
de Fuca that could extend across Whidbey Island for lingering
gusty winds into the evening hours.

The trailing upper trough slides overhead into Monday, ushering in
a cooler air mass. This will bring temperatures some 10 degrees
cooler than Sunday, with many locations only reaching the mid
50s. Some lingering moisture will likely maintain showers across
the area, especially in the mountains. Snow levels will fall with
the colder air arriving to around 4,500 ft or so, but moisture
should be quite limited by the time the snow levels fall closest
to the Cascade passes. Decreasing showers into Tuesday as heights
begin to rise over the region as a deeper low develops well
offshore over the eastern Pacific.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Dry weather continues to
start the midweek period with higher pressure aloft setting over
the region for a couple of days. This could bring a good setup for
efficient radiational cooling each morning, bringing the
potential for temperatures to drop into the mid 30s with pockets
of frost possible in the outlying areas Wednesday and Thursday
mornings. Expect the higher pressure to break down late in the
week, opening the door for renewed precipitation chances as the
next disturbance crosses into the western U.S.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface cold front will sweep through the terminals
today (currently sitting offshore with a low pressure centered over
Victoria). Flow aloft remains strong out of the west, which will mix
down to the surface today. This morning: showers continue in north
and west terminals. These showers continue to reduce visibilities to
2-3 miles at times. Ceilings are VFR towards the south, and a mix of
MVFR and IFR to the north/west (low ceilings with mist/fog being
reported). Morning activity will taper back, with a break in
activity until the front sweeps through this afternoon. Ceilings
will improve for areas east of the Olympics to VFR/MVFR with partial
clearing before the next round of precipitation this afternoon.
Moderate to heavy rain will be possible (especially at northern and
coastal terminals) reducing visibilities down to MVFR/IFR. Gusty
winds out of the south are expected later today. Sustained winds of
10-20 kt with gusts to 30-35 kt are expected late this morning and
afternoon as the front sweeps from west to east. This will be a
concern for possible LLWS between west winds aloft, and south winds
near the surface.

KSEA...Rain/mist has cleared out to the north, with ceilings
improving to low-end VFR for the moment. Still may bounce between
MVFR/VFR early this morning with partial clearing taking place ahead
of the next front. Rain showers will arrive 21Z along with windy
conditions (southwest winds 10-20 kt gusting to 30 kt). Winds will
die down later tonight with potential for lower ceilings Monday
morning.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front off the Washington coast remains offshore,
with low pressure over the Victoria area. This front is expected to
produce areas of rain (reducing visibilities), and widespread gusty
southwesterly winds across all waters today as it passes through.
All waters are under small craft advisories, timed with when the
strongest winds will arrive over each specific zone. For the coastal
waters: expect the strongest winds (20-30 kt, occasionally
gusting to 35 kt) to arrive late this morning into the afternoon,
along with waves of 9 to 12 feet. For the Strait of Juan de Fuca:
east winds will pick up late this morning in the western portion
of the strait. Stronger winds (20-30 kt, occasionally gusting to
35 kt) in the west/central strait will arrive later this afternoon
and continue through late Sunday evening. The east strait (along
with the Northern Inland, Admiralty Inlet, and Puget Sound Zones)
will see southerly winds of 20-30 kt pick up late this morning,
and veer to the west this afternoon.

Rest of the week: High pressure will build offshore with low
pressure inland, creating quiet onshore flow over most of the
waters. Seas will drop to 4 to 6 feet Monday through next
weekend, and potentially build back up to 6 to 8 feet then.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Sharp rises continue on many rivers draining the
Olympics and North Cascades this morning as the atmospheric river
has remained draped across the far northern parts of the local
area (and especially to the north). While the Bogachiel River near
La Push has crested, additional focus remains on the Nooksack
River in Whatcom County and the Skokomish River in Mason County.
These will both climb above the action stages and will need to be
closely monitored through the day today, although current forecasts
do not currently reach flood stage. Generally 3 to 6 inches of
rainfall have fallen in these areas over the last 24 hours and
expect another round of steadier rain later today as the cold
front sweeps through. This will likely be the last dose of
hydrologically relevant precipitation and it looks to push through
somewhat quickly as it moves across the area. Some showers
linger into Monday, but should not be sufficient to cause
additional flooding Drier conditions toward midweek will allow
rivers to level off and recede.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
