Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
311 PM PDT Thu Oct 24 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge over the area will keep the area
dry until late Friday evening. Unsettled weather will persist
throughout the weekend bringing gusty winds, rain, chance of
thunder, and mountain snow. Temporary relief from precipitation on
Tuesday as surface high pressure builds over the area. Another
round of storms returns mid next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The early light showers
have tapered off and satellite is currently showing mostly clear to
partly cloudy skies in the area. Slightly warmer and drier
conditions should persist until tomorrow with the upper level
ridge situated over the area. A deepening upper level trough is
expected to bring unsettled weather through the area Friday
evening through the rest of the weekend. The main concern with
this system will be the winds, particularly Friday evening through
Saturday morning. Strong southerly winds will first impact
locations along the coast and then make their way inland into
Friday night. The strongest winds will be along the coast and
Admiralty Inlet, with maximum wind gusts between 35 to 45 mph.
Other locations that will see strong winds gusts include the San
Juan Islands and Western Whatcom County,with maximum wind gusts of
25 to 40 mph. Other locations can also expect breezy conditions.
Easterly winds will bring breezy winds through the Cascade Gaps,
near North Bend and Monroe through the day on Friday. A Wind
Advisory is set to go into effect on Friday night for Admiralty
Inlet and North Coast areas. Localized power outages and tree limb
damage is possible with this wind event.


Rain will likely begin to move into the coast Friday night and
gradually become more widespread into the weekend. The highest
rain accumulations will be along the coast and mountain ranges (2
to 4 inches). Other locations in the lowlands will see around 1
to 1.5 inches. Refer to the .HYDROLOGY section for additional
information. In addition, there is a chance for isolated
thunderstorms possible on Sunday, with models showing a 15 to 20
percent chance. This will bring the chance for higher localized
rainfall accumulations. This weather system will also bring a few
inches of snow to the mountains on Sunday as snow levels lower to
4000 to 4500 ft. Temperatures through the weekend will generally
be in the 50s, near normal.

MGF

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...The upper trough axis will
move overhead and slide eastward on Monday for continued unsettled
conditions and periodic showers. Snow levels will also lower further
Monday to near 3500 to 4500 feet for light higher elevation mountain
snowfall. Brief break in the precipitation may be possible on
Tuesday with a flattening ridge overhead. The active weather pattern
then returns Wednesday into Thursday as troughing digs southward
over the Pacific Northwest from BC. Uncertainty exists in the
ensembles regarding the trajectory of the trough, as well as
location during this period. However, given the relatively lower
snow levels in place, mainly between 3000 to 4500 feet, another
round of accumulating snowfall is possible for the Cascade Passes.
Otherwise, high temperatures will be approximately 5-10 degrees
cooler than normal next week. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly-southwesterly flow aloft with light northerly
flow the surface as transient ridging remains over the area.
Mostly VFR conditions this afternoon as remaining cloud cover
slowly dissipates. Some high level clouds will move in tonight but
will continue to remain VFR. Latest guidance shows limited fog
development tonight into Friday morning. Any fog that does develop
will likely be localized in the river valleys near KOLM for brief
MVFR/IFR conditions. VFR will likely persist elsewhere thru
Friday.

KSEA...VFR this afternoon with light northerly winds around 3 to
knots. North winds will likely increase to around 5 to 10 knots
after 00z, and continue throughout the overnight. Winds will take
a slight NE component through Friday morning and stick between 7
to 9 knots. Not much confidence in any fog forming at the terminal
in the morning, with a 20% chance of MVFR conditions through 17z.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure continues to remain over the waters
resulting in rather benign conditions through the beginning of
Friday.

A robust frontal system will start to approach the area
waters by Friday afternoon, with southerly winds increasing over
waters. Small craft southerlies are in place starting Friday
afternoon over the coastal waters, before increasing to Gale
Strength by Friday night into Saturday. The Gale Watch for the
coastal waters has been upgraded to a Gale Warning. A Gale Warning
has also been issued for East Entrance of the Strait of Juan De
Fuca and Admiralty Inlet for strong southeasterlies.

As the system moves over the interior waters late Friday night,
winds will also increase in the West and Central Entrance of the
Strait along with the Northern Interior Waters for small craft
advisories. Other inner waters, such as Puget Sound, may also
reach headline criteria but as of now confidence is low.

Coastal seas today are around 3 to 6 feet, but will start to build
upwards to 13 to 15 feet Friday night into Saturday. The highest
seas will be focused mainly in the outer water zones (13 to 15
feet) meanwhile, seas 9 to 12 feet will be focused more in the
inner water zones, closer to the coast. Seas look to remain 10+
into the first half of next week.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system will move into Western Washington
Friday night with unsettled weather, and periods of steadier
precipitation, through Monday. Snow levels will rise to 7000 to 8000
feet on Saturday, before falling to near 4000 feet on Monday.
QPF totals during this period are expected to range 2 to 4 inches
across the Olympics and Cascades, leading to a rise in area rivers.
At this time, river flooding is not expected. However, rivers will
continue to be monitored, particularly the Skokomish River this
weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
