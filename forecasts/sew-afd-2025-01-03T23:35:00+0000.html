Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
335 PM PST Fri Jan 3 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Lingering precipitation continues this afternoon.
Another frontal system will bring lowland rain and mountain snow
Saturday afternoon into Sunday morning. A system will move across
southern Washington into Oregon Sunday night. Ridging will build
for drier weather Monday afternoon into Tuesday. A weak front may
be possible midweek, but drier than normal conditions expected
next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper low offshore
continues to bring showers to Western Washington this afternoon
with areas of light to moderate mountain snowfall. The upper low
will slide eastward across the Pacific Northwest tonight for a few
lingering showers into Saturday morning. Another frontal system
will quickly follow and move across the region Saturday afternoon
into early Sunday. This system will bring another round of lowland
rain. In addition, locally breezy south winds are expected
Saturday evening ahead of the front around Whidbey Island, with
gusts ranging 25 to 40 MPH. In addition, snowfall will increase
over the Cascades Saturday afternoon, with snow levels around 3000
feet rising to 4500 feet by Sunday morning. Snowfall amounts of 4
to 8 inches are expected for White and Stevens Pass during this
period, with amounts up to 10 to 12 inches for Mt. Baker and
Paradise areas. Snow initially for Snoqualmie Pass will transition
to a rain/snow mix, with potentially a brief period of light
freezing rain Saturday night, with total snow accumulations of 2
to 6 inches. A Winter Weather Advisory has been issued for this
timeframe due to the snowfall amounts and weekend travel. If you
are traveling, check WSDOT for the latest road conditions and
information.

Precipitation will become more showery Sunday afternoon before
another system slides across the southern tier of the CWA, mainly
across southern Washington into Oregon for additional rainfall.
Ridging will then build offshore on Monday for drying conditions.
Some sunshine will be around by Monday afternoon as well. Highs
through Monday will be in the upper 40s to low 50s. JD

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
High pressure will dominate the long term period, as ridging
builds onshore throughout the day Tuesday. Ensembles and
deterministic models indicate the ridge will briefly flatten
Tuesday night into Wednesday as a weak wave ripples through the
ridge for increased cloud cover and slightly elevated POPS,
before reamplifying Thursday. The next decent chance for
precipitation comes Friday, although amounts don`t look impactful
at this time. The main concern for the long term is fog and low
stratus development each morning under stagnant conditions, but
each afternoon will likely give way to sun breaks. Temperatures
will stay within a few degrees of normal through the long term. NS<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Flow is becoming more southerly as an upper-low
approaches offshore. Then, flow turns variable overnight before
trending west-northwest aloft during the day. Mixed cigs out there
currently as rain and showers track northward. As conditions trend
drier, some improvement to VFR is possible across area terminals
this evening. However, low-level moisture is likely to remain with
more MVFR-IFR conditions likely to return overnight into Saturday.
Especially with more incoming rain by Saturday afternoon. Breezy
surface winds should decrease overnight.

KSEA...VFR at the time of this writing (2125z). KATX shows
additional showers south of the airfield pushing northward. With
that, more MVFR conditions (vis & cigs) are possible this afternoon
but improvement to low-end VFR should be met by the evening.
Confidence is not particularly high but there`s a chance for MVFR
cigs between 14-16z given latest NBM and HREF probs. A better chance
exists during the afternoon as widespread rain sweeps through
starting around 20-22z.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>998 mb surface low offshore continues to fill and churn.
SCA winds should be allowed to subside through the strait and
coastal waters this afternoon. But, heightened seas are to remain
tonight through much of the weekend keeping the coastal SCA in
place. The next disturbance is favored to arrive Saturday-Saturday
evening and track into Vancouver Island. Small Craft southerlies are
expected over the coastal waters and East Entrance with bleed over
possible into Admiralty Inlet and Northern Inland Waters. Can`t rule
out isolated gale gusts during this time as well. Going into next
week, high pressure is favored to develop leaving more benign
weather in the forecast.

As already mentioned, seas remaining high this evening and Saturday
between 10-12 ft. Forecast for the remainder of the weekend and the
start of next week has them returning to the 7-9 ft range.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A series of weather systems will move across western
Washington through the weekend bringing additional precipitation to
the region. Despite each of these systems remaining fairly
progressive, roughly 1 to 4 inches of rain is expected to fall along
the southern Olympics through Sunday. This could push the Skokomish
River over flood stage Sunday morning. Rises on the remaining rivers
are expected as well, but no river flooding is forecast.

A drier weather pattern setting up beginning Monday will allow all
the rivers, including the Skokomish, to recede. Felton/14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
