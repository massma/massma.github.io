Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
903 AM PDT Sat May 10 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Weather over western Washington will turn more cooler
and showery today as a weak system passes through the area. A more
organized front will cross the area Sunday into Monday for more
widespread rain. Upper level ridging will start to build into the
area midweek for the return of warm and dry conditions.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No significant changes made
to the forecast this morning. The previous discussion can be found
below along with updates to the aviation and marine discussions:

High clouds over much of W WA in advance of incoming weak front
associated with an upper level low off the BC coast as per current
satellite imagery. Radar showing some light echoes out over the
coastal waters, with perhaps the very edge of this line hitting
the far NW corner of the Olympic Peninsula. Models remain pretty
consistent with this initial feature focusing more along the coast
as well as the northern interior of Whatcom and Skagit
counties...but minimal PoPs elsewhere today.

A more organized front is still on tap for Sunday, reaching the
coast in the early morning, hesitating there before rushing eastward
in the afternoon. This will be the best chance for precip in the
near term, with most locations seeing high-end chance to likely PoPs
/50-75 pct/. Consensus over the track of the upper low remains in
place, taking the feature south into the OR coast before it treks
eastward. This will make W WA the recipient of some wrap around
moisture, keeping precip in the forecast for Monday morning...but
not quite as uniform as previously, instead becoming more showery.
By Monday afternoon, conditions dry from west to east with precip
really only lingering over the Cascades for the remainder of the day.

Daytime highs will cool compared to yesterday. Today will be the
warmest of the three, but Saturday, Sunday and Monday will all see
temps generally ranging in the lower to mid 60s while water adjacent
locations will be a touch cooler, ranging in the mid to upper 50s.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Aforementioned showers will
persist over the Cascades Tuesday while the remainder of the CWA
will remain dry thanks to an upper level ridge starting to build
into the area. Models continue to suggest that this ridge does not
quite have the strength of the main ridge out over the Pacific and
as such does not entirely clear out lingering moisture. While some
ensemble members suggest that this might be enough for some light
precip, the majority keep conditions dry Wednesday into early
Thursday...although this moisture will keep clouds over the area.
There is some consensus on the next system reaching W WA late in the
day Thursday and into Friday. Deterministic GFS makes this front
pretty organized which would result in another good chance for rain
over the area, however deterministic ECMWF characterizes this system
as distinctly unorganized. Ensembles and NBM highlight this
uncertainty by keeping PoPs low...mostly 20-30 pct, topping out at
40 pct in higher elevations...and this is fine starting point for
this extended period until better agreement emerges.

Temps in the extended will carry the trend from the short term with
most lowland locations in the lower to mid 60s and water adjacent
locations in the mid 50s to around 60. There are suggestions for
some warming to begin on Friday, which could possibly get temps back
up to near 70 for the weekend, however with the uncertainty that far
out, not sure how much confidence to put into that trend.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level trough offshore moving south and
remaining offshore into Sunday morning. Southwesterly flow aloft.
Light onshore flow in the lower levels.

Middle and high level clouds over the area with ceilings aoa 7000
feet. Ceilings lowering to 4000-6000 feet Sunday morning as trough
approaches coast.

KSEA...VFR with middle and high level clouds. Southerly winds 4
to 8 knots. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak systems will track move through the region into early
next week. Strongest post frontal onshore push Monday night with
small craft advisory westerlies in the Central and Eastern Strait
of Juan de Fuca. Northwest swells around 10 ft will reach the
outer Coastal Waters on Tuesday. Another weak system crosses the
waters early Wednesday. Felton/33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
