Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong upper level ridge combined with weak low
level offshore flow will lead to unseasonably warm temperatures
through Friday. The ridge will slowly weaken and slide eastward
over the weekend for increasing onshore flow and a cooling trend.
Troughing will develop offshore midweek.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Clear skies across
Western Washington this afternoon with warming temperatures,
generally in the 70s to low 80s. A strong upper ridge will be in
place Thursday over the Pacific Northwest. In addition, low level
offshore flow will increase into Thursday, allowing for easterly
winds over the Cascades. Temperatures will warm significantly on
Thursday into the mid 80s to mid 90s. Overnight temperatures will
also remain elevated through at least Friday, with lows in the
upper 50s to mid 60s. This will lead to widespread Moderate
HeatRisk levels across Western Washington, with areas of Major
HeatRisk in the Cascade and Olympics Valleys. For this reason, the
Heat Advisory remains in effect for Thursday, as well as through
Friday for interior areas. Numerous daily record temperatures may
fall on Thursday, with additional records possible on Friday. Of
note, there will be a slight increase in onshore flow on Friday,
allowing for some cooling along the coast, however, temperatures
have trended a tad warmer for Friday in this area as well.
Otherwise, hot, dry, and unstable conditions will lead to critical
fire weather conditions over the Cascades and Olympics, refer to
the .FIRE WEATHER discussion for more information.

The upper ridge will gradually shift eastward on Saturday with the
ridge axis on Saturday over the interior Rockies. In addition,
subtle troughing offshore may allow for a few convective showers
to develop over the Cascades, but confidence is low at this time.
Increasing onshore flow will bring a cooling trend beginning
Saturday as well. Temperatures on Saturday are expected to be in
the 70s along the coast, and into the 80s for the interior.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Ridging will further
weaken over the Pacific Northwest on Sunday with increasing
onshore flow and likely morning stratus spreading into Puget
Sound, and certainly along the coast. Ensembles generally suggest
troughing begins to develop offshore Monday into mid-week,
although some uncertainty exists in how quickly troughing
influences Western Washington. Either way, the cooling trend will
likely continue through early next week, in addition to an
increase in precipitation potential generally Tuesday into
Wednesday. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>All morning low CIGs/VIS have cleared for sunny skies
this afternoon (minus a cloud band area off the coast between Forks
and Hoquiam). Winds have gusted up to 20 kt in a couple areas this
afternoon out of the north/northeast (SeaTac and Olympia) - these
will die down overnight to between 4 and 8 kt (northerly winds in
Puget Sound, easterly winds in the Cascades and Olympics).

Forecast tomorrow morning is another tricky setup. The upper level
ridge will be centered over Western Washington Thursday, with it
lifting deep into Canada. Flow aloft will be weak with light
northeasterlies (becoming easterlies). With there being less
moisture tomorrow morning (compared to Wednesday morning), so the
fog/low cloud IFR/LIFR chances will be primarily confined to the
coast, and potentially in Western Snohomish County. Winds tomorrow
will be out of the east in the Cascades/Olympics/Strait of Juan de
Fuca at 4 to 8 kt, and out of the north in Puget Sound/coastal
waters at 6 to 10 kt.

KSEA...VFR/clear skies for the remainder of Wednesday. Few gusty
northerly winds up to 18 kt found their way to the surface earlier
today, but will diminish to north/northeast below 10 kt for the rest
of the evening, and under 5 kt overnight. There`s a small chance (15-
20% chance) of low clouds developing Thursday morning, but with the
drier air and ridge overhead, most likely will not see low cloud
coverage at this time. Winds pick up from the north tomorrow at 6 to
10 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Strong upper level ridging will continue to build over
surface thermal troughing off the coast today. These will begin to
slide inland through Thursday. Offshore flow winds have been
observed in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, with northerly winds in
remaining inland waterways and coastal waterways. Strongest winds
this afternoon have been over the Puget Sound waters (couple gusts
to 12 kt) but have been light elsewhere. A few low clouds are
possible in the Strait of Juan de Fuca and coastal waters Thursday
morning, but coverage is not expected to be as widespread as
Wednesday morning (some fog may accompany the stratus in the coastal
waters).

By Friday, the flow will return to onshore/northwesterlies with high
pressure building over the coastal waters, and the thermal troughing
to the east. WInds may become gusty in the outer coastal waters
Friday afternoon up to and exceeding 20 kt. Otherwise, the flow will
become southerly early next week as the next disturbance brings a
chance of rain showers to the region.

Seas will begin to build tonight from 3 to 5 feet to 5 to 7 feet
Thursday, decreasing to 3 to 5 feet by Sunday. Expect shorter
periods and more wind-driven seas Thursday to Friday with the
northwesterlies.

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridging and an associated surface
thermal trough along the coast will continue to build tonight into
Thursday. This will allow conditions to become increasingly warm,
dry, and unstable. As fuels rapidly dry, these conditions will
combine to create critical fire weather conditions over the
mountains on Thursday. A return to onshore flow on Friday over the
Olympic Peninsula will begin to bring cooler, moist air to the
Olympics while the Cascades remain warm, dry and unstable.

Winds will also turn easterly over the Cascades beginning late on
Wednesday. While they will not be overly strong, a period of gusty
winds is expected late Wednesday night into early Thursday morning
as air funnels through the gaps over the Cascade crest. Another
period of offshore flow is expected Thursday night into Friday, but
it looks to be less strong.

Fire Weather Watches have been upgraded to Red Flag Warnings
beginning late tonight. Winds over the North Cascades do not look to
be as strong as those over the central Cascades, therefore the start
time has been pushed back to tomorrow morning, focusing on the
threat from dry and unstable conditions.

Cooler and more moist air will return area-wide through the weekend
with some potential for chances of some wetting rains as early as
the beginning of next week. LH<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
