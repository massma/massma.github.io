Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
845 AM PST Wed Nov 6 2024

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Patchy fog has developed in some areas in the southern
interior, but should eventually dissipate later this morning. The
current forecast remains on track, and no significant updates are
needed at this time.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SYNOPSIS...An upper level ridge will begin to bring drier
conditions to the area tonight and over the next couple days. A
series of systems will bring rain, mountain snow, chance of
thunder, and breezy winds starting on Thursday evening and
continue through the middle of next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...A dry and cool morning early
today across western Washington with mid to high level cloud
cover and temperatures in the low 40s. These high clouds should
help to limit the fog potential this morning, through a few
isolated spots of patchy fog cannot be ruled out this morning.
Cloud coverage will decrease throughout the day today, allowing
for periods of sun, especially as you go southeast. Areas such as
Bellingham and the northern Pacific coast look to remain mostly
cloudy. High temperatures will reach the low to mid 50s. Tonight
looks to be mostly clear, with low temperatures falling into the
30s, with the coolest temperatures in the Southwest Interior.
Thursday and Friday will be warmer, with highs in the mid to upper
50s and lows in the 40s. Cloud cover will begin to increase on
Thursday as the next frontal system begins to approach the area.
The front will approach and and stall just northwest of the area
on Friday, allowing for chances for rain to begin as early as
Thursday night over the northwest Pacific Coast before slowly
spreading inland throughout the day on Friday. High snow levels
(above 6000 ft) will limit any mountain snowfall with this system.
This system looks to be the driest system win the forecast as we
go into a wetter and very active pattern into the long-term
period.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The aforementioned front
will move through on Saturday, with another system following on
its heels Sunday and slowly moving through Monday into early
Tuesday. Through the long-term period, periods of rain, mountain
snow (as snow levels lower to around 3000-3500 ft by Sunday), and
breezy winds. Several inches of rainfall is possible in some areas,
with a 45-65% chance of seeing over 4 inches of rain over the 72-hour
span from Saturday through Monday across the Pacific Coast, the
Olympics, and the northern Cascades. In this same time period,
there is a 75% chance of seeing over 1 ft of snow at Stevens and
White Pass. At this time, snow levels look to remain high enough
that Snoqualmie Pass will receive up to a few inches of snow
through these three days.

Ensemble cluster analysis and each of the deterministic model
solutions all reveal slight variance in the exact evolution,
timing, and magnitude of the systems that move through Friday and
into early next week, but overall the pattern and probabilities
favor significant rainfall, mountain snow, and breezy winds
through the long term period. With the active pattern,
temperatures look to remain static, with highs in the low 50s and
lows in the 40s. LH

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest flow aloft will become westerly today as
upper ridge axis shifts inland. Surface winds generally light and
variable at most terminals save HQM where easterly winds in place
there with speeds 4-8 kts. Should see most terminals turn more
northerly by this afternoon, however speeds will remain minimal,
topping out around 3-6 kts.

Most locations reporting VFR conditions although seeing some MVFR to
IFR conditions in the Chehalis River valley. These locations should
return to VFR conditions by early afternoon. Clearing skies today
and this evening will make it easier for stratus/fog development
overnight tonight or early Thursday morning with latest forecast
solutions bringing more widespread MVFR to IFR conditions emerging
by 12Z and continuing into at least late morning.

KSEA...Mid and high clouds today with VFR conditions in place.
Likely to see stratus development by 12Z Thursday morning dragging
cigs down to IFR. Surface winds light E/SE this morning becoming
northerly in the afternoon, but speeds still relatively light
generally ranging 3-6 kts.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will remain over the waters Wednesday and
Thursday. A weakening front will arrive on Friday before a stronger
system arrives over the weekend.

Seas of 5 to 7 ft should remain in this general range before
starting to increase Thursday evening ahead of a series of frontal
systems expected to pass through the waters over the weekend.

27/18<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...The next chance of significant precipitation is
forecasted to arrive Saturday through Monday. At this time, the
Skokomish River is the only river forecasted to rise above flood
stage. For other rivers, significant rises are expected and
flooding could be possible, but at this time is not forecasted.
The amount of flooding will depend on rainfall rates, temperatures
and snow levels with precipitation that falls with these systems.
