Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Dry conditions are expected through the work week
with a mix of clouds and sun across the region. The warmest day
will be Friday, with highs topping out in the upper 60s to low
70s. Next chance of precipitation will come next weekend into
early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>It`s been a lovely and
quiescent spring day across western Washington today. Mostly
clear skies have been in place for most areas with some thin
cirrus over the northwestern part of the state. This comes as the
result of a ridge of high pressure dominates the pattern across
the Pacific Northwest. The ridge axis lies over the inland
northwest and will flatten over the next couple of days as a pair
of systems moves through western Canada and grazes western
Washington. This will lead to slightly cooler conditions through
Wednesday, but otherwise little in the way of sensible weather
impacts are expected.

High amplitude ridging is expected to lean into the region by
Thursday, allowing for a brief warming trend to commence.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...The aforementioned high
amplitude ridge will translate across the state Friday, leading to
what will likely be the warmest day of the week with temperatures
in the mid-60s to low-70s.

By Saturday, ensemble guidance is in good agreement that the
ridge will break down leaving the door open for weather systems
and cooler northwest flow across the region. While not impressive,
this Saturday through Monday time frame will be our next chance
for any more widespread showery precipitation across western
Washington.
