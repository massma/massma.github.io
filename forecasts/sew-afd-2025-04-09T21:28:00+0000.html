.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will build into western Washington
through Thursday morning, allowing for drying and warming. A
front will bring in widespread rain and breezy winds Thursday
afternoon, with troughing maintaining showers mainly over higher
terrain through Saturday. Upper level ridging will build into the
Pacific Northwest by the end of the weekend, causing temperatures
to rebound with dry conditions into next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A ridge of high pressure
will continue to amplify northward into western Washington today,
allowing conditions to dry out. Despite passing clouds, the region
will see plenty of sun breaks with highs peaking in the upper 50s
and low 60s.

In the warm sector as the next system approaches, temperatures will
follow a warming trend into Thursday with most lowland areas seeing
highs in the 60s. Areas along the western Cascade foothills could
even see temperatures reaching the low 70s. Rain ahead of an
approaching cold front will reach the coast Thursday morning,
spreading inland by the late afternoon. Onshore flow will increase
as the front meanders inland, with another round of breezy 25 to 35
mph winds.

Behind the front, troughing will maintain shower activity across
western Washington with the highest probabilities for accumulating
precipitation over the mountains. High resolution models continue
to show potential for more convergence zone showers to develop
late Thursday into Friday morning over Snohomish and Skagit
Counties. Snow levels will lower to roughly 2000 feet by
Friday, with a few inches of accumulating snow on track through
the Cascade Passes through Saturday. Temperatures Friday and
Saturday will peak in the mid 50s across the lowlands, with
another round of breezy winds Saturday as the trough axis moves
eastward over the region.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Models continue to show
good agreement over high pressure rebuilding on Sunday and
amplifying northward into Monday, bringing in another round of
warmer and drier conditions. Ensembles continue to show potential
for a weak trough along the periphery of the ridge to bring light
showers north of the Puget Sound mid-week, with strong consensus
that high pressure will rebound towards the end of next week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West to southwest flow aloft as a ridge building over
the area gradually shifts to the east, allowing troughing to
approach closer to W WA. VFR conditions this afternoon will
continue throughout the evening and into Thursday morning. High
clouds will stream in ahead of an approaching front on Thursday,
and will help limit any fog or low cloud development tonight.
Brief northerly winds this afternoon will switch to more S/SE
tonight and will be light.

KSEA...VFR conditions this afternoon as high clouds stream in
ahead of an approaching front. VFR will continue through Thursday
morning. Surface winds will see a northerly switch around 23-01z
but will remain light. Winds will then switch from the SE
overnight into early Thursday ahead of the aforementioned front,
and will likely increase in strength later Thursday afternoon.
