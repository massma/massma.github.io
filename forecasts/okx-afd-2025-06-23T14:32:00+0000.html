Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
1032 AM EDT Mon Jun 23 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure continues to build into and south of the region into
Tuesday. A cold front briefly stalls close to the area on
Wednesday before working slowly south Thursday into Friday across
the northern Mid Atlantic states. The front will then return north
over the weekend, stalling close to the area.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
* Extreme Heat continues for the entire area.

The area remains under a large building upper level ridge with
surface high pressure to the southwest. Low level moisture
remains extremely high with dew points in the middle 70s for
much of the area. As daytime heating begins, rapid warming of
the surface is expected to occur under mostly clear skies.
Temperatures are expected to rise well into the 90s for much of
the area with western portions of the area possibly hitting
100. Heat index values today will generally be in the 105-110
range for much of the area with the exception of the immediate
coast, mainly Long Island and SE coastal CT. Extreme Heat
Warnings continue for these areas.

Heat advisories are in effect for SE coastal CT and much of Long
Island. Opted to expand the heat advisory to northeastern
Suffolk given the extent of heating from the previous day
precluding the heating expected today and Tuesday.

Lows tonight will be in the 70s to near 80 for the NYC metro.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
* Extreme Heat headlines continue into Tuesday.

* Heat lessens Wednesday but still remains hot.

Not much of a significant change in the airmass expected for
Tuesday as compared to Monday. The most significant change is a
slight lessening of the afternoon dew points due to a bit more
mixing of the lower atmosphere. Despite lower dew points,
surface temperatures may actually end up being a few degrees
hotter than Monday in most places. NE NJ, the Lower Hudson
Valley, and the NYC metro may rise into the low 100s. Even Long
Island is expected to rise into the middle to upper 90s given a
light W/SW flow. The combination of slightly hotter temperatures
and slightly lower dew points will result in heat index values
nearly identical to Monday for most places, but perhaps hotter
for coastal locations, mainly Long Island. Lows Tuesday night
will be in the middle 70s for most to low 80s for the NYC
metro.

By Wednesday morning, the ridge begins to break down a bit and
push south as the mid-levels flatten out a bit. Mid-level energy
may approach the area from the west with a slow moving weak
surface front moving into the area from the north. This may
result in the increased chance for showers and thunderstorms to
develop during the afternoon and evening.

As for the heat, temperatures Wednesday will not be as hot as
Monday or Tuesday but will still be hot enough to possibly
result in heat headlines continuing, though more in the form of
Heat Advisories as opposed to Extreme Heat Warnings. Highs will
be in the low to middle 90s for most with upper 90s possible for
the more urban areas. Lows Wednesday night will be a touch
cooler than previous nights with lows in the upper 60s to middle
70s.

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
Key Points:

* A more unsettled weather pattern likely develops Thursday  through
  the upcoming weekend.

A confluent upper flow between the northern and southern branches of
the polar jet will allow high pressure across eastern Canada to
expand into the Northeast on Thursday. This will likely give a
stalled frontal boundary across the area the needed push to sag
slowly south into the Northern Mid Atlantic by Friday. This is where
it is expected to park itself before returning north as a warm front
on Saturday. There is some uncertainty in the 00Z global guidance as
to how far south the front initially gets and then when it returns
north on Saturday, which could have a significant impact on
temperatures. The NBM is showing a large range between the 25th and
75th percentiles for temperatures, especially away from the coast
for Thursday and Saturday. The forecast area resides at the southern
edge of the westerlies during this time. The magnitude of any
shortwave energy will largely determine the position of the
boundary. It will also be unsettled with high PW air in place and a
boundary with potential waves to focus showers and thunderstorms. It
is too early to be specific with details but bouts of heavy rainfall
across the area is a possibility. It will also remain quite humid
with dew points in the 60s.

NBM deterministic temperatures during this time are generally skewed
toward the 25th percentile (cooler) while the median is skewed
toward the higher (warmer) temperatures. Using the deterministic
values in the forecast, daytime highs are generally at or just below
normal, while lows are a bit above. This is due to the close
proximity of the front, cloud cover, and rain chances.

.AVIATION /15Z MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure remains in control.

VFR thru TAF period.

Light northerly/vrb winds with seabreezes developing except
KSWF. Speeds largely at or under 10 kt.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Timing of seabreeze may vary by 1-3 hours.

KLGA may hold on to a NE wind around 5 kt into early afternoon.

.OUTLOOK FOR 12Z TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...

Tuesday: VFR.

Wednesday: Chance of showers/tstms in the afternoon/evening mainly
for KSWF/KHPN/KTEB/KEWR.

Thursday and Friday: Chance of showers/tstms mainly in the
afternoon/evening.

.MARINE...
Sub-SCA conditions are expected through Friday night across all
of the forecast waters.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
A boundary in close proximity to the area Thursday into
Saturday will have to be monitored for potential bouts of heavy
rainfall.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
There is the potential for isolated minor coastal flooding during
the nighttime high tide cycles this week. This is due to high
astronomical tides associated with a new moon on June 25. There
is little wind forcing at this time to produce much surge. A
coastal flood statement is possible during this time for SW CT
and the south shore back bays of Nassau.

There is a low risk for the development of rip currents at all
the ocean beaches for both today and Tuesday.

&&

.CLIMATE...
Increasing heat may result in record high temperatures through
Tuesday.
