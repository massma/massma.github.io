Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
330 PM PST Thu Mar 6 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Dry conditions are expected across western Washington
through Friday as an upper level ridge moves over the area. The
ridge will push further inland on Saturday, allowing for a weather
system moving into British Columbia to brush the northwest tier
of Washington over the weekend. Additional systems moving into
the region next week will bring the potential for lowland rain,
mountain snow, and gusty winds to western Washington.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
stratus breaking up across the Sound this afternoon, which has
made way for some afternoon sun across the area. Temperatures
this afternoon are trending in the upper 40s and low 50s - and
are expected to top out in the low to mid 50s. With skies clearing
and with moisture remaining in the low levels, can expect another
round of low stratus and fog to develop across the Sound overnight
into early Friday.

An upper level ridge will move overhead on Friday, keeping
conditions dry across western Washington. Morning clouds will
scatter by the afternoon for another round of afternoon sunshine.
High temperatures are expected to be in the low to mid 50s.

The upper level ridge will push further inland on Saturday, allowing
for a system moving into British Columbia to sink further south
and brush the northwestern tier of the area. While the bulk of
the moisture looks to remain to the north, the most likely areas
to see precipitation will be the coast, Olympic Peninsula, and
areas generally from Snohomish county northward. The remainder of
the region generally looks to remain dry on Saturday, though will
need to keep an eye on how this system trends over the next day or
two. A few inches of snow will be possible for the North Cascades,
with areas around Mt. Baker generally seeing new snow amounts
between 1-4 inches, with higher amounts for the highest peaks.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...The ridge will flatten
over the area on Sunday, allowing for the system to sink further
south and move into western Washington. Lowland rain will increase
Sunday afternoon and evening. Snow levels will fall down to
2000-3000 ft by late Sunday, bringing around 2-4 inches of snow
for the passes by Monday. Additional rounds of rain and mountain
snow will continue as upper level troughing sets up over the
northeastern Pacific and another system moves into the area on
Tuesday. A stronger system may approach near midweek, which may
bring a period of stronger winds to the region. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northerly flow aloft as weak upper level ridging
builds over the area. VFR conditions across all area terminals
this afternoon, with generally N/NE winds 5 to 10 knots. Winds
will start to turn southerly tonight, along with the return of low
clouds (MVFR/IFR) with the potential of LIFR in lower prone
places. Could see low clouds starting to develop around 12z and
persist through 19z-22z, where VFR will eventually rebound.

KSEA...VFR conditions this afternoon with N/NE winds around 4 to 8
knots this afternoon. Winds will start to turn S/SE after 05z and
will be generally light. Low stratus will make a return to
the terminal late tonight into Friday morning (11z-18z) with a
30% chance of MVFR conditions. LOw clouds will scatter around 20z
for a return to VFR.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure offshore will bring calm and
benign marine conditions to the area waters into Friday. The
previous Small Craft Advisory for the outer coastal waters will be
allowed to expire as seas will continue to decrease under
criteria. A frontal system will move over the waters late Friday
night into the weekend, likely bringing small craft winds over the
coastal waters. A more active weather pattern looks increasingly
likely early next week through midweek.

Coastal seas around 6 to 8 feet this afternoon, gradually
increasing late Friday night to 10 to 14 feet.
