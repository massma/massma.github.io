Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Wet and unsettled weather is expected to continue
through the rest of the week as a series of weather systems will
move across Western Washington bringing rain, mountain snow, and
breezy winds. Drier conditions are expected next week as surface
high pressure settles over the Pacific Northwest late Sunday
afternoon.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cloudy skies continue to
persist across Western Washington ahead of an occluded front by
the coast. Radar imagery shows isolated showers continue to move
over the region and are expected to last into the late afternoon
hours.

A more organized system is expected to impact the region early
Friday morning and precipitation will become more widespread
throughout the area as it moves from the south to the north
throughout the morning hours. This system will bring lowland rain,
mountain snow, and breezy conditions. Easterly winds across the
Cascade gaps will bring breezy conditions to the passes, with
maximum wind gusts possibly gusting to around 35-45 mph. A winter
weather advisory is currently in effect for portions of the
southern Cascades. Snow levels will rise to 5000-5500 ft on Friday
morning, however the easterly winds through the Cascades may keep
a shallow cold layer near the surface bringing the chance of
mixed precipitation and/or trace of freezing rain for localized
areas along the Cascade passes through Friday evening.

Another system is set to impact the region during
the weekend bringing another round of lowland rain, mountain
snow, and breezy conditions. Winds gusts of 15-20 mph are possible
with this storm system, with the strongest wind gusts primarily
concentrated along the coast and northern interior. Snow levels on
Saturday morning will drop to 3000-3500 ft. However they are
expected to increase above 4000 ft early Sunday morning as surface
high pressure gradually builds over Western Washington.
Precipitation associated with this weekend system seems to be
mostly concentrated along the coast, Olympic Peninsula and the
Cascades, with the mountains seeing the bulk of the precipitation.

Snowfall accumulations at Stevens Pass and White Pass from Friday
to Sunday are forecasted to be around 8-12 inches, whereas lower
amounts, around 4 inches, are possible at Snoqualmie Pass due to
higher snow levels.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Cluster analysis is in good
agreement for a positively-tilted upper level ridge building over
the Pacific Northwest, likely bringing drier conditions to
Western Washington starting on Monday. Guidance has this upper
level feature persisting for the rest of the week and steering
storms systems to our north into British Columbia. The ridge may
begin to break down as early as Thursday, however confidence is
low on the timing as some of the cluster analysis solutions still
hint at an amplified ridge over the Pacific Northwest. Some of the
NBM guidance does have some PoPs returning for the middle of the
week, however they are on the lower side at this time (20-30%).

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft this evening turning southwesterly
overnight into Friday as a trough offshore draws near. Surface winds
in some spots are light and variable with others reporting E and SE
winds between 4 to 10 kt.

Ceilings are gradually rebounding back to VFR. However, light showers
are maintaining scattered obs of MVFR to localized IFR. For the
evening, mostly VFR will become more widespread. Then the next
disturbance is in line to arrive during between 12-16z Friday with
widespread rainfall and lower ceilings. A mixed bag of MVFR
(localized IFR) and VFR are favored into the day on Friday.

KSEA...We`ve gradually lifted to low-end VFR this afternoon. The
terminal is expected to remain under VFR throughout most of the TAF
period. However, a disturbance offshore is slated to bring
widespread rain into early Friday morning. NBM and HREF are showing
the probability for cigs less than 3k ft around 70-80% for a few
hours around midday. SE winds becoming more E-NE this evening before
turning southerly into Friday between 5 to 10 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A couple of occluded surface lows remain over the NE PAC
with higher pressure over the interior. SCA remains over the coastal
waters due to heightened seas. For early Friday, a disturbance is on
tap to bring strong offshore flow as SCA have been issued for the
West/Central Strait. Can`t rule out the potential for brief gale
force gusts. Along with winds, seas will build into Friday, peaking
Friday evening 12-14 ft for the outer coastal waters and 9 to 11 ft
for the inner. Seas gradually ease Friday night into Saturday
morning before rising to 10 to 13 ft again over the weekend.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A series of weather systems will move across western
Washington through the weekend, which will bring additional
precipitation to the region. Each of these systems will be fairly
progressive, which will limit the total rainfall accumulation with
each system. Snow levels will start out between 5000 to 6000 feet
on Friday and drop to 3500 to 4500 feet Saturday and Sunday. The
heaviest rainfall amounts are expected over the southern Olympics,
where 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected Friday through Sunday.
This could be enough to push the Skokomish River over flood stage
this weekend. Rises on the remaining rivers are expected as well,
but no river flooding is forecast. Felton/14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
