Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
1017 AM PDT Sun Aug 25 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Upper level ridge over the area today and tonight
moving east Monday. Upper level trough dropping down from the
Gulf of Alaska moving through Monday night into Tuesday morning.
Stronger upper level ridge building over the area Tuesday night.
The ridge will remain over the area through the weekend. Low level
flow going offshore later Thursday into Friday pushing high
temperatures above normal.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No major forecast updates
have been made this morning. More sunshine has started to show
itself as the clouds begin to scatter. The rest of the previous
discussion can be found below with an updated aviation section.

Flat upper level ridge continuing to build over Western
Washington today. Low level flow has gone light overnight. This
plus a deep layer of low level moisture will keep skies cloudy
over Western Washington this morning. Eventually the subsidence
from the ridge and the late August sun(note the sun this time of
year is equivalent to late April sunshine) will dissipate the low
level moisture leaving partly to mostly sunny skies by mid
afternoon. With the subsidence and the deep layer of low level
moisture could see some areas of drizzle get squeezed out of the
layer this morning. Temperatures getting a slow start with the
cloud cover. Even with the upper level ridge overhead highs a
little below normal, in the mid 60s to lower 70s.

Flat upper level ridge remaining over the area tonight. Upper
level trough moving out of the Gulf of Alaska moving a little
faster than previous model runs. The trough will still be north of
Vancouver Island by 12z Monday but that will be close enough to
throw some high clouds over at least the northwest portion of the
area. Lows tonight in the 50s.

Upper level ridge moving east Monday with the upper level trough
axis reaching the offshore waters by 00z Tuesday. Showers out
ahead of the trough spreading over the northwest portion of the
area in the afternoon with the highest pops along the north coast.
Highs a little warmer with filtered sunshine in the morning and
increasing clouds in the afternoon, in the mid 60s to mid 70s.
Upper level trough axis moving inland late Monday night with
showers spreading across the entire area. Lows in the mid 50s.

Trough axis east of Western Washington Tuesday afternoon with
shower activity coming to an end for the most part in the morning.
Good onshore push behind the trough giving breezy/windy
conditions near the Strait of Juan de Fuca and over the Northwest
Interior. Skies clearing somewhat in the afternoon but with the
cooler air mass still over the area highs only in the 60s.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Models continuing with
the scenario of a stronger upper level ridge building over Western
Washington beginning Tuesday night. Ridge remaining over the area
through the weekend. 500 mb heights in the mid to upper 580 dms.
Thermally induced surface trough moving up the Oregon coast
Thursday making it to the Washington coast Friday. This will turn
the low level flow offshore and push high temperatures above
normal Friday and Saturday, in the mid 70s to mid 80s. Highs
Wednesday in the mid 60s to mid 70s, Thursday 70s and lower 80s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak high pressure aloft building across Western
Washington this morning, maintaining northerly flow at the upper
levels. Patches of low ceilings linger, but expect the scattering
trend to continue with most sites improving to VFR by 21z. Low level
winds remain mostly southerly this morning, switching to northerly
(and west near the Strait) by midafternoon. Low clouds likely return
overnight for some spots, but coverage should be less widespread
tonight as the air mass dries a bit. The next front begins to
approach late in the day Monday, with increasing clouds through the
afternoon.

KSEA...Mostly VFR through the day as low clouds scatter, but a few
patches of lower clouds may drift through around 19z. Otherwise,
southerly surface winds veering to northerly this afternoon but
remaining light. Some lower clouds may reform late tonight after 11z
with around a 25% chance for low MVFR ceilings around daybreak.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak surface ridging will build across the waters today
before shifting inland Monday morning ahead of an approaching weak
frontal system. Increasing onshore flow behind the front on Tuesday
will likely lead to some headlines for the coastal waters and
portions of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Additionally, persistent
post-frontal northwest winds over the coastal waters will lead to
some choppy conditions as we approach mid-week. A more typical late
summer pattern develops for the second half of the week as broad
surface ridging strengthens over the offshore waters and thermally
induced low pressure deepens over the Inland Northwest. This will
lead to diurnally driven increases in onshore flow. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
