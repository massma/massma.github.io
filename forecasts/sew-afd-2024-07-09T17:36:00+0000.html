Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
1036 AM PDT Tue Jul 9 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Very hot and dry conditions continue today across the
region as the upper level ridge remains over the area. Thermal low
pressure will shift eastward today, bringing increased onshore
low level winds to the coast by tonight. This brings some cooler
temperatures for many over the next two days, but still well above
normal. High pressure remains over the region with high temperatures
remaining above normal through early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge over
the area early this morning shifting east later today. Thermally
induced surface trough over the area early this morning will move
into the interior midday and east of the Cascades late today.
Temperatures aloft remaining very warm with 850 mb temperatures in
the plus 20C to 24C range this afternoon. Highs for the interior
in the mid 80s to near 100. Highs along the coast are going to be
a tough call. A difference of a couple of hours in the westerlies
kicking around midday could result in a 5 degree plus error. The
ensemble spreads for Hoquiam and Quillayute highs today are around
15 degrees. Westerlies should kick in along the central coast
before the north coast making the central coast a little cooler.
Highs in the mid 70s to lower 80s.

Thermally induced trough east of the Cascades tonight. Increasing
onshore gradients with the KUIL-KBLI gradient getting above plus
3 mb and the KHQM-KSEA gradient peaking around plus 3 mb. This is
strong enough to push some marine air into the interior by early
Wednesday morning. Lows in the 50s and lower 60s.

Onshore gradients continuing Wednesday but weakening during the
day. Temperatures aloft cooling with the ridge axis east of the
area but 850 mb temperatures still in the plus 16C to 20C range
late Wednesday afternoon. In general 5 to 10 degrees of cooling
for the interior with more cooling along the coast. This puts
highs in the mid 70s to upper 80s for the interior and mid 60s to
lower 70s for the coast.

Little change in the pattern Wednesday night and Thursday with
flat upper level ridge over the area and varying degrees of low
level onshore flow. Cooling temperatures aloft combined with
the low level onshore flow will continue the cooling trend over
the interior with highs in the mid 70s to mid 80s. Highs along the
coast will remain in the mid 60s to lower 70s. Lows Wednesday
night with the onshore flow will mostly be in the 50s.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Little change in the pattern
Friday through the weekend with flat upper level ridge over the
area. 500 mb heights remaining in the mid 580 dms. Weak low level
onshore flow continuing through Sunday. Models hinting at a weak
trough that could enhance the low level onshore flow Monday. Even
with the trough, ensemble means on both the GFS and ECMWF keep
Seattle highs in the lower to mid 80s through the period including
Monday ( and further into the middle of next week ). With the
onshore flow, late night and morning clouds along the coast will
try to make their way inland in the early morning hours. At this
point it looks like the clouds will stay west of Puget Sound.
The low level onshore flow will keep high temperatures for the
interior in the mid 70s to mid 80s. Highs along the coast mid 60s
to lower 70s. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong upper ridge axis continues to gradually shift
east of the region with southwesterly flow aloft. The low level flow
remains light onshore, but will turn northerly by this afternoon
with speeds increasing. VFR conditions in place and expected to
persist for most terminals throughout the TAF period. However,
increasing onshore flow tonight will bring IFR/LIFR stratus to
coastal areas, such as HQM, by around 06Z tonight. Stratus will
spread locally inland tonight to around SHN by sunrise on Wednesday.

KSEA...Clear skies. Surface winds generally N/NW 5 to 9 knots
backing to light S/SW after 09Z Wednesday morning. 27/18<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Broad surface ridging over the coastal and offshore waters
will remain in place through the week. Thermally induced low
pressure over the interior of Western Washington will shift
eastward tonight resulting in an increase in onshore flow for the
second half of the week. Small craft advisory westerlies are
expected in the central/east strait late this afternoon and tonight,
and as such headline in place there will remain unaltered. A weak
weather system passing well to the north of the area will increase
the onshore flow further on Wednesday with gale force westerlies a
strong possibility in the central/east strait Wednesday evening.
Will evaluate the need to upgrade for the afternoon forecast
package. A fairly static summer onshore flow pattern remains
Thursday into the weekend for diurnally driven increases in the
westerlies in the strait and occasional small craft advisory
winds/seas over portions of the coastal waters.

Seas generally 4 to 6 ft today and Wednesday before increasing to 6
to 8 ft Thursday. 27/18<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Another dry and hot day for the interior. Instability
over the Cascades will result in critical fire weather conditions and
a Red Flag Warning remains in effect today for the Cascades. For the
lower elevations of the central and southern Puget Sound relative humidity
values could get as low as the teens late this afternoon. Onshore
flow will bring higher humidities beginning Wednesday. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
