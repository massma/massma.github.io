Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
342 AM PST Tue Nov 19 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cool upper level trough moving out of the area this
morning. Rapidly developing strong surface low well offshore will
continue to strengthen and be about 300 miles off the Washington
coast by late this afternoon. The low will track slowly north
tonight. Strong winds developing late this afternoon into
Wednesday morning alongside lowland rain and mountain snow. An
active pattern is favored to continue into the weekend with low
pressure offshore.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
upper level trough over Western Washington early this morning with
scattered showers mainly over the central portion of the area and
along the coast. Back out in the Pacific, strong surface low
showing signs to developing near 42N/137W. Under cloudy skies
temperatures were in the mid 30s to lower 40s.

Showers coming to an end this morning with southwesterly flow
aloft pushing some warmer air into the region. Snow levels this
morning down around 1000 feet. Heavier showers could produce a
rain snow mix or brief snow on the higher hills north of Seattle
to the Canadian border.

The big weather maker for Western Washington, a rapidly
developing surface low well offshore, still on track to create
impactful weather over the area tonight. Surface low currently
near 42N/137W with a surface pressure around 990 mb. The low will
turn northeast today and continue its rapid development. By 18z
the low will be near 45N/132W and be at least 20 millibars deeper.
In the next six hours the low will not move much but will continue
to bomb with the central pressure of the low dropping to near 950
mb. Even though the low is well offshore it is strong enough to
cause a rapid increase in easterly gradients across Western
Washington beginning later in the afternoon. As the low drifts
slowly north tonight easterly winds will become strong over parts
of the area. Models still indicating surface gradients through
the Strait of Juan de Fuca bottoming out near -9 millibars this
evening while the cross Cascade gradients gets as low as -14
millibars. High wind warnings are already up for the coast,
Western Strait of Juan de Fuca, East Puget Sound Lowlands and the
Bellevue area. East winds as strong as 45 mph with gusts as high
as 60 mph forecast for these areas. The gusts in the Cascade
foothills along the I-90 corridor, for example near North Bend,
could be a little stronger, as high as 70 mph. The models continue
to show good flow reversal in the 850-700 mb layer which brings
up the possibility of mountain wave activity over the Cascades.
The mountain waves have the potential to come off the Cascades and
surface somewhere in the Cascade foothills. Enumclaw and Black
Diamond have been susceptible to surfacing mountain waves in the
past. For locations outside the high wind warning areas, wind
advisories are in effect for tonight for wind gusts as high as 50
mph. Strong easterly wind events are not common in this area
outside the Cascade foothills. Due to the terrain there are many
places, like Edmonds and the South Puget Sound south of Tacoma
that can be sheltered from easterly winds. Another characteristic
of easterly wind events in the lowlands the winds usually do not
ramp up. There is quick acceleration of the winds. In the scenario
today it looks like the big increase will occur in the 00z-03z
time frame over most of the area. A little earlier along the
coast. If you notice it is not very windy yet in the middle of the
afternoon just be patient. Front spinning out of the low will
spread rain over the southwest portion of the area later this
afternoon with the rain moving over all of Western Washington this
evening. With the strong cross Cascade gradient, increasing
precipitation and snow levels remaining below pass levels, a rare
blizzard warning is in effect for the Cascades tonight.
Increasing snow along with winds gusting to 50 mph in the passes
will make travel conditions tough to impossible.

Front moving through Wednesday morning with steady rain Tuesday
night changing to showers by Wednesday afternoon. The strong
surface low will move off to the northwest and weaken. Gusty
southeasterly winds continuing over the Northwest Interior in the
morning. The wind advisory could end up being extended into later
Wednesday morning.

Huge upper level low remaining offshore Thursday with
southwesterly flow aloft over the area. Nothing organized spinning
out of the low but the southwesterly flow aloft will send moisture
into the area. This combined with a slightly unstable air mass
will produce showers throughout the day.

High temperatures today in the mid to upper 40s, a little warmer
Wednesday and Thursday with highs near 50. Lows through the
period in the upper 30s to mid 40s.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement with another surface low and associated front spinning
out of the large upper level low over the Pacific moving into
Western Washington Friday for a wet and windy day. Model solutions
become inconsistent after Friday. Operational runs outliers in the
ensemble solutions with the operational runs indicating some
drying over the weekend while the ensemble solutions on both the
GFS and ECMWF are wet. With nothing organized indicated in the
solutions and an upper level trough in the vicinity will call the
precipitation showers at this point. There is some consensus that
the trough will move inland Monday keeping showers in the
forecast. Not real confident in the Saturday through Monday
forecast with little run to run continuity. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly/southwesterly flow this morning will start
turning southerly ahead of a strong area of low pressure
approaching W WA later this evening. A mix of MVFR/IFR early this
morning as showers continue through the area. Can expect this mix
of ceilings to stay through the morning before potentially lifting
to VFR into the afternoon, and maintaining. Showers will continue
through the day.

The biggest aviation challenge will be the winds this evening, as
the aforementioned strong area of low pressure will generate
strong easterly winds across much of the interior. North to south
oriented runways will face some crosswind challenges, with
gusts up to 35, maybe even 45 kts. The higher gusts will be
mainly focused near the Cascade foothills, but we will see
sustained easterly winds through much of the interior around 20 to
30 kts. Winds will start increasing near coastal terminals around
21z, meanwhile interior terminals will see increasing winds by
00z. Ceilings should remain VFR as easterly winds tend to dry out
the lower levels, but could see potentially some visibility
restrictions as heavier showers move over area terminals.

Additionally, there is a possibility for a subtle ridgetop inversion
in the Cascades, which could generate some mountain wave activity
that may impact terminals near Puget Sound. Confidence on this
scenario is low (less than 15-20 percent), but it is something to
be aware of. Winds will start to subside by Wednesday morning.

KSEA...MVFR/IFR at the terminal this morning with rain showers
lowering visibilities and ceilings. Southerly winds this morning
mainly around 5 to 10 kts. Showers will continue to linger this
morning before picking up more in coverage later this afternoon,
but can expect a rebound to VFR later this morning (15z-18z).

Winds will turn easterly around 18z-21z and rapidly increase in
speed, with sustained winds generally around 20 to 30 knots, and
gusts potentially over 35 kt through the evening, and overnight.
As mentioned above, the possibility for mountain wave activity
impacting Puget Sound terminals exists, but confidence is low at
this time. These gusty easterly winds will start to decrease by
12z Wednesday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong, robust area of low pressure around 960 mb,
will impact the coastal waters beginning this afternoon and last
into Wednesday morning. Here are the key points for the marine
forecast:

* Seas: Seas will continue to remain elevated this morning, with
  recent buoy observations this morning generally around 11 to 13
  feet. Small Craft Advisories currently out will change over to
  Storm Warnings to reflect the onset of the increasing strong
  easterly winds. Seas over the outer coastal waters may reach
  heights of 25 to 30 feet, with 12 to 18 ft seas closer to the
  Washington coastline, and the highest seas (27 to 30 feet) in
  the outer coastal water zones. The Storm Warning also extends to
  the Strait of Juan de Fuca where the winds potentially could
  generate seas of 7 to 11 feet, but with an unusual easterly
  wind, there is some uncertainty of the building fetch of waves
  in the Strait.

* Wind: The onset of the strongest winds over the waters will
  begin late this morning, and intensify throughout the afternoon
  and evening. Winds associated with the storm warning call for
  gusts of 65 kt with sustained speeds of 40 to 45 kt. There is
  the potential for gusts to even reach Hurricane Force (70 kts),
  but these winds once again will be in the outer coastal water
  zones (and also way offshore) and will likely be brief as the
  front crosses. A Storm Warning also resides in the Strait of
  Juan De Fuca, with gusts up to 55 kts, even with the easterly
  wind direction. Elsewhere, Gale Warnings will continue for the
  Northern Inland Waters, Admiralty Inlet, and in addition, the
  Puget Sound and Hood Canal.

* Grays Harbor Bar: Rough bar conditions will linger throughout the
  duration of this storm, but with an extra consideration on the
  unusual east wind. Combined with the ebbs and heightened seas on
  the immediate coast, conditions are likely to remain hazardous
  across the bar.

In the wake of this system, seas and winds will be slow to
subside, with seas staying above 10 feet into the weekend, and
winds likely staying around Gale Force through Wednesday.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Precipitation over the Olympics tonight into
Wednesday could push the already running high Skokomish River above
flood stage Wednesday. The flood watch for Mason county will
continue. Lower snow levels in the Cascades, as low as 2000 ft
during the heaviest precipitation, will limit runoff and reduce
any flooding chances for rivers flowing off the Cascades.
Precipitation for the remainder of the period will come in bursts.
This combined with snow levels remaining relatively low will keep
rivers in their banks. The exception to this will be the
Skokomish with the river remaining near flood stage into the
weekend. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
