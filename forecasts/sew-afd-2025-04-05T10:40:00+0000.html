Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge over the area today will shift east
tonight. A slow moving front will move inland Sunday night. Upper
level trough over Western Washington Monday with another frontal
system arriving Tuesday. Temporary upper level ridge trying to
build Wednesday before another system Thursday. Upper level trough
remaining over the area Friday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
mostly clear skies over Western Washington at 3 am/10z.
Temperature dew point spreads getting near zero in the South Puget
Sound but not fog being reported. Temperatures mostly in the upper
30s to mid 40s.

Upper level ridge remaining over the area today stalling a weather
system offshore. Forecast will have some cloud cover in it but the
clouds will be high level clouds. Patchy fog in the South Puget
Sound will be gone by mid morning. With the front stalling
offshore, a little offshore flow in the morning and warm south
southwesterly flow aloft highs today will be well above normal, in
the 60s and lower 70s. While no record highs are expected the
forecast high of 69 in Seattle would tie for the 4th warmest April
5th in 81 years.

Upper level ridge shifting east of the area tonight but with the
parent low associated with the offshore front moving north the
front will not be making much eastward progress overnight. Rain
out ahead of the front reaching the coast in the early morning
hours. Increasing middle level clouds for the remainder of the
area will result in warmer low temperatures versus this morning,
in the mid 40s to lower 50s.

Rain slowly spreading inland Sunday reaching the the Puget Sound
area early in the afternoon and the Cascades by late afternoon.
Elevated snow levels, 6500 to 7500 feet, so just rain in the
passes and Olympics. Parent low for the front in the Gulf of
Alaska with little surface gradient over the area. Winds not much
of a factor. A little gusty in the usual spots like Whidbey
Island. Highs lowering to the mid and upper 50s.

Front moving through Sunday night with rain all areas. Snow
levels remaining elevated keeping the precipitation type as rain
in the passes. Lows in the mid and upper 40s.

Upper level trough swinging into the area Monday keeping showers
in the forecast. Increasing onshore gradients with the trough in
the afternoon could produce some breezy conditions ( not great
for the cherry blossoms ). Highs in the mid 50s.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Quick moving system pushed
along by a 130-140 knot jet across the Eastern Pacific arriving
Tuesday evening with rain ahead of the front during the day
Tuesday. Jet moving inland over Central Oregon so Western
Washington not getting the strongest portion of the system but
still enough to give the area another round of rain.

Upper level ridge trying to build in the wake of the system
Wednesday but the ridge not looking strong enough at this point to
keep a chance of showers out of the forecast.

GFS and ECMWF ensembles in good agreement with another fast
moving system being pushed by a 100 knot plus jet moving into
Western Washington Thursday. Like the previous system an upper
level ridge will try and build behind the front Friday. Ensembles
not very impressed with the ridge. Both models have precipitation
on at least half of the ensemble solutions. This will keep a
chance of showers in the forecast.

High temperatures near or slight above normal through the period.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Winds aloft will turn more out of the SW throughout the
upcoming TAF period. Patchy fog possible this morning for terminals
such as KOLM. However, VFR should prevail for most areas today
through tonight with surface high pressure. Generally light surface
winds this morning aside from KHQM. Winds shifting towards the SW
between 5 to 10 kt as the day progress. Gusts near 15 kt possible
for KHQM this afternoon. Winds then switch SE overnight ahead of an
approaching front with similar magnitude.

KSEA...VFR conditions prevail through the TAF period with increasing
mid to high level clouds today. Winds light and variable so far this
morning but will shift southwesterly between 5 to 10 kt as the day
progress before a southeasterly shift overnight into early Sunday.
