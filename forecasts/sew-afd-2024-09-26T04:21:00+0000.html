Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
921 PM PDT Wed Sep 25 2024

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A convergence zone continues this evening across King
and Snohomish Counties with lingering rain across the Cascades as
well as the frontal system moves east of the area. The CZ will
slowly taper off tonight, with perhaps lingering drizzle, mainly
into the central Cascades early Thursday morning. A few showers
elsewhere tonight, with some localized clearing. No major updates
this evening.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showers continue tonight, mainly with a convergence
zone, with onshore flow. Another system will move into the region
Thursday evening into Friday, bringing another round of rain and
gusty winds. Conditions will then dry out over the weekend.
Additional, weaker systems may move into the area early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front is passing
through western WA this afternoon with post-frontal onshore flow
tonight (Puget Sound Convergence Zone setting up over the
King/Snohomish county line). The air mass is slightly unstable
with a chance of thunderstorms in the interior and Cascades (and
within the PSCZ tonight). Most areas seeing measurable rain with
this system with wetting rains in the Cascades. There will be
lingering showers with the convergence zone late tonight.

We`ll see a brief break on Thursday, then more rain and wind
Thursday night into Friday as the next Pacific frontal system
moves in. The coast and North Interior will be the windiest with
south gusts to 30-45 MPH. Total rainfall amounts are less compared
to today`s system with the focus mainly over the northern Olympic
peninsula and North Cascades. Showers will decrease toward the
afternoon as this system lifts north. Temperature-wise, we`ll
continue to track a few degrees cooler than average with highs in
the mid 60s and lows in the 50s.

There`s broad, weak troughing over the region moving into Saturday
but the there`s little moisture or forcing. Overall it`s looking
like a cool and cloudy forecast with dry conditions.  33

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Weak ridging replaces the
trough on Sunday for more cool but dry weather. The wind flow
pattern does turn offshore for less cloud cover. Heights rise
slightly on Monday with a warmer air mass and warmer temps (closer
to average). Ensemble members are mostly in favor for rain
returning Tuesday and Wednesday as the ridge shifts east and
another trough moves in from the Pacific. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West-southwest flow will increase into Thursday with
more zonal flow aloft. Post-frontal showers continue this evening,
primarily in an area of convergence across King and Snohomish
Counties. The convergence zone will taper off later tonight into
early Thursday morning. MVFR cigs will continue in this region,
with some slight improvements at times to low-end VFR tonight.
However, IFR cigs may develop early Thursday morning due to
lingering moisture of King/Snohomish Counties. Elsewhere, MVFR/IFR
cigs will develop early Thursday morning for most areas. Patchy
fog will be possible as well, with the best potential at KOLM,
KHQM, and KBLI. Cigs will improve later Thursday morning with VFR
high clouds increasing Thursday afternoon. Generally south winds
tonight. Winds will then increase Thursday afternoon ahead of the
next front, with breezy winds for the coast, and terminals
adjacent to the water from Snohomish County northward.

KSEA...MVFR cigs continue this evening with continuing convergence
zone activity over King CO. Brief improvements towards low-end
OVC/BKN VFR may be possible tonight, generally between 07-10z.
MVFR/IFR cigs are then expected early Thursday morning,
particularly between 11-18z. There is a 20% chance of LIFR cigs
during this period as well. Cigs will improve to VFR in the
afternoon with increasing high clouds. S/SW will continue,
increasing Thursday evening. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...A cold front continues to move through the waters this
afternoon. Rain will continue to move across with this front, with
some of the stronger showers reducing visibilities at times (thunder
threat is low). Strong southerly winds continue to diminish behind
the front (buoy 41 showing gusts to 20 kt and seas dropping from
13.5 feet earlier this afternoon down to 6 to 8 feet). The gusty
wind threat continues for the central/east Strait of Juan de Fuca
(small craft advisory continues through late tonight with the threat
of westerlies of 15 to 25 kt with gusts to 35 kt possible).

A second front remains on track to pass through the region Thursday
afternoon into Friday. Widespread gusty southerly winds 20 to 30 kt
(with gusts to 35 kt) are expected over the coastal waters Thursday
afternoon and evening. Post front, gusty winds are expected to make
their way through the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and some of the inland
waters. In addition, seas will build back up to 13 to 16 feet at 10
to 12 seconds (with the highest seas in the outer coastal waters).
Behind the front, winds will turn to the west and northwest, and
remain only breezy in the outer coastal waters Friday and Saturday
(up to 20 kt). Seas will drop to 6 to 8 feet for the weekend, and
further decrease to 4 to 6 feet next week.
