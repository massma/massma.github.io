Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
224 PM PST Sun Jan 19 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will dominate the weather into the
middle of this week, bringing dry conditions and cold overnight
temperatures. Lows will fall below freezing over much of Western
Washington tonight and into next week while daytime highs will
remain below normal.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mostly clear skies across
W WA as lingering fog/low clouds have eroded. Upper- ridging is
in place offshore leaving W WA under dry northerly flow aloft.
This feature will continue to be the main influence throughout the
short-term period along with below average temperatures. For
tonight, dry and cold weather is favored with widespread 20s in
the forecast. A Cold Weather Advisory remains in effect tonight
through Monday morning for the Seattle, Tacoma, Bellevue, Everett,
Bremerton and vicinities. An additional advisory has been issued
for East Puget Sound Lowlands for the same time. Confidence has
increased on east winds producing wind chill values as low as 15
to 20 F, especially for areas along the Cascade gaps such as North
Bend. Monday`s weather is likely a carbon copy of Sunday`s as
we`ll wake up to cold, frosty conditions with areas of fog. We`ll
warm up into the lower 40s across the CWA as mostly sunny skies
prevail but still well-below average for daytime highs for mid-
January. The aforementioned ridge axis will cross the PNW by
Monday afternoon as a shortwave trough and weak front is hot on
its heels. Increasing cloud coverage may bump temperatures up by a
few degrees for Monday night but cold conditions are likely to
remain.

Models aren`t too impressed with the shortwave trough as precip
chances remain next to none for Tuesday. Dry weather and below
average temperatures will remain in store through midweek as
guidance is in firm agreement with the redevelopment of ridging
over the region on Wednesday. Daytime highs will continue in the
lower to mid 40s with overnight lows in the mid 20s to lower 30s.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Ridging remains into
the first half of Thursday but trough influence may return by
Thursday evening, although there`s disagreement on exact timing
and intensity. Regardless, the NBM has latched on to this
and has introduced PoPs, albeit weak ones, on Thursday and
carrying into Friday. Below normal temperatures are favored for
much of the long term. Ridging appears more favorable into the
weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper ridge will remain offshore through tonight for
continued northerly flow aloft, before transitioning to more
westerly flow Monday afternoon. VFR through this evening with mainly
SKC. Areas of FZFG will develop again tonight into Monday morning,
particularly from OLM southwards and in local river valleys, with
LIFR conditions in these areas. VFR conditions elsewhere. High
clouds will then increase later Monday into Monday night. North to
northeast winds continue into this evening, remaining locally breezy
near BLI with gusts up to 15 to 20 kts. Winds will then become
lighter overnight into Monday with more of an easterly component.

KSEA...VFR conditions with SKC into tonight. Generally VFR
conditions expected to continue into Monday. There remains a slight
chance of localized FZFG developing in the vicinity of SEA early
Monday morning, primarily between 13 to 17z. However, confidence
remains low. High clouds will increase Monday afternoon. N winds of
8 to 14 kts will continue into this evening before becoming more ENE
tonight into Monday morning at 4 to 8 kts. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will remain over the waters through Monday.
Offshore winds will continue through Monday as well. Fraser River
Outflow will increase this afternoon into tonight, which may bring
occasional wind gusts of 20 to 25 kt to portions of the northern
Inland Waters, particularly this evening. Locally breezy east winds
will also exist through tonight for central and western Strait of
Juan de Fuca and northern Coastal Waters. However, widespread SCA
wind gusts are not expected during this period.

A frontal system will weaken as it crosses the region Monday night
into Tuesday, bringing no significant impact to the waters. High
pressure will then rebuild later Tuesday through midweek for another
round of offshore flow. Another weather system will slide southward
across the waters later Thursday into Friday for increasing north
winds, especially for the Coastal Waters. SCA winds may be possible
for the Coastal Waters due to winds during this period.

Seas will range 6 to 8 feet through Tuesday night before subsiding
to 3 to 5 feet on Wednesday. Seas will then build again to 8 to 12
feet later Thursday into Friday. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
