Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
426 PM EDT Tue Jun 4 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will be in control tonight. A warm front approaches on
Wednesday and passes through during Wednesday night into Thursday
morning. This will be followed by a cold frontal passage at night.
Thereafter, a broad area of low pressure will reside across eastern
Canada through the weekend before exiting offshore early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Isolated showers possible across the northern fringe of the forecast
area with some instability until around sundown. Dry weather
otherwise, as high pressure will be centered off the New England
coast. Anticipating low stratus and fog to become more widespread
tonight versus last night. Less certain regarding how much of it
becomes dense. Winds at the bottom of low level inversion are
forecast to be slightly stronger than what they were last night, so
while fog in general may be more widespread, dense fog might not be
as widespread tonight as it was last night. The cloud cover will
help keep low temperatures a few degrees above normal.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Clouds and fog dissipate in the morning, but additional cloud cover
arrives ahead of a warm front which will be advancing from the west.
Some CAPE builds over the western zones in the afternoon, but in the
absence of notable mechanical lift, only an isolated shower or
thunderstorm will be possible. Highs in the mid and upper 70s for
coastal areas, and 80-85 inland.

A warm front arriving from the west is forecast to push through most
of the forecast area by the end of Wednesday night. Moisture deepens
with PWATs increasing to nearly 2 inches. Combined with the lift
ahead of the advancing front, showers become likely west to east
starting early evening. Some elevated CAPE will be present, so an
isolated thunderstorm will be possible. Shear profiles and limited
CAPE will mitigate the severe thunderstorm potential. The steering
flow increases overnight, so flash flooding is not a concern during
this period. Minor nuisance/urbanized flooding is still possible
however.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The forecast period will generally be unsettled into early next
week as multiple upper vorticies track across eastern Canada
and in close proximity to the Northeast. Global models do have
some differences with the wavelength separation between these
features and the overall evolution and interaction. This will
impact the location and the trajectory of shortwave energy
rotating about these features.

Before then though, a frontal system out ahead of the first
upper vortex dropping into the Great Lakes sends a warm front
through the area Thursday morning, followed by a pre-frontal
trough and cold frontal passage in the late afternoon/evening
hours. The bulk of the rainfall comes in the early morning
hours ahead of the warm front, with the area getting into the
warm sector for much of the daytime hours. Airmass is moisture
laden with PWAT around 2 inches. This combined with a pre-
frontal trough/cold front should trigger showers and thunderstorms
that work into the area during the late afternoon/evening
hours. There is decent CAPE, but narrow and more typical of slow
rising updrafts. Expect there to be heavy downpours, but
steering winds will be on the order of 30 kts. So any flood
threat should be brief and more of the minor nuisance variety.
Storm total rainfall is from 0.50 to 1.00" with some locally
high amounts possible. Once again, most of this comes with the
the warm advection early in the morning. Severe threat is low.

Following the cold frontal passage Thursday night, there will
be a chance of showers and thunderstorms through the period,
but mainly in the afternoon hours as shortwave energy rotates
about the main upper vortex north of the area. This does not
look like a washout at this time based on the area being more on
the southern side of the system with a subsident westerly flow.
Rain chances are generally 20 to 40 percent during this time,
highest across the interior. This is subject to change though
due to complexities previously mentioned in the upper levels.

Temperatures on Thursday will also be complex due to a southerly
flow with high dew point air potentially keep coastal areas
enshrouded in low clouds/fog, while areas from NYC north and
west could get some decent heating in the warm sector. This will
depend on how much clearing these areas see. Used a blend of
the NBM and NBM50th for warmer values away from the coast (low
to mid 80s), but a blend of CONSALL and NBM to account for the
cooler coastal areas (low to mid 70s). Cooler air will be slow
to advect into the region behind the cold front. Used a blend
of the NBM and CONSALL to reflect values closer to normal
Saturday through Monday, with a gradual warmup heading into
Tuesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /20Z TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
High pressure remains off the New England through the TAF
period.

VFR through this evening. Expecting another round of
fog/stratus tonight into Wednesday morning with the persistent
onshore flow. Conditions could begin to lower again as early as
01z, before becoming more likely toward midnight and
thereafter. IFR or lower in this period. Improvement Wed AM
after 12Z, but could linger into late morning for some. Mainly
VFR conditions are expected Wednesday afternoon, however a few
late day isolated showers or thunderstorms will be possible
after 20z, however confidence is too low to include in the TAF
at this time.

A south-southeasterly flow is expected this afternoon, then
more southerly tonight. Speeds at or under 10 kt. Winds remain
from the South on Wednesday.

     NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Lower confidence on timing of sub VFR conditions tonight into
Wednesday morning and this may be off by several hours.

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...

Wednesday: MVFR or lower conditions possible late day into the
night with chances of showers and thunderstorms.

Thursday: MVFR or lower possible in showers and thunderstorms,
mainly during the daytime hours.

Friday: Chance of MVFR with showers and possible thunderstorms.

Saturday/Sunday: Chance of MVFR in showers.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Not much low stratus and fog seen on satellite at the moment, but
expecting both to develop and expand across the waters tonight.
Might need to eventually issue a dense fog advisory, but currently
don`t have enough confidence in timing and placement without any
ground truth.

Conditions will otherwise continue to remain below SCA levels
through Wednesday night with a relatively weak pressure gradient in
place.

SCA chances increase on the ocean Thursday into Thursday night
with non-ocean waters likely remaining below SCA thresholds.
Ocean seas may linger near 5 ft early Friday before lowering
under weakening SW flow. Thereafter, conditions are expected to
remain below SCA levels through the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>There are no hydrologic concerns through Wednesday afternoon.
Rainfall amounts of 0.50 to 1.00" with localized higher amounts
are expected late Wednesday night into Thursday. Minor nuisance
poor drainage flooding in the main threat.

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
With the approach of a new moon this week, astronomical levels are
on the rise. A southerly, then southeasterly, flow will also support
increasing surge this week. This should be sufficient to get some of
the vulnerable locations along the western LI Sound and the South
Shore Bays to break minor flood benchmarks. A Coastal Flood Advisory
remains in effect for coastal Fairfield, Westchester, and
Nassau for this evening`s high tide, with a Coastal Flood
Statement in place for coastal Queens, where the most vulnerable
spots may see brief minor flooding.

The persistent flow and astronomically high tides will likely
lead to additional minor flooding in subsequent evening high
tides into late this week.

There is a moderate rip current risk on the ocean beaches through
Wednesday due to around 2 ft seas on the ocean and onshore
south to southeast winds reaching up to near 10 kt.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
