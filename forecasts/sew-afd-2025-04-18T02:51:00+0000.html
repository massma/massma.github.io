National Weather Service Seattle WA
751 PM PDT Thu Apr 17 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Upper level ridge over the area will move east Friday
night. Upper level trough arriving early Saturday with showers
returning to the forecast. Upper level trough remaining over
Western Washington over the weekend. The trough will move east
Monday being replaced by a dry and weaker trough Tuesday. Upper
level ridge building Wednesday and Thursday.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The latest forecast remains
on track with no updates this evening outside of a refreshed
aviation section below. Latest satellite shows clearing skies
this evening under northerly flow aloft. Upper level ridge over
the area with the ridge axis moving over Western Washington later
tonight keeping skies mostly clear. Surface gradients going light
overnight with lows in the mid 30s to mid 40s.

Surface gradients remaining light Friday with the upper level
ridge axis overhead. This will make Friday the warmest day in
this set with highs in the 60s and lower 70s. Most of the lower
70s will be from Seattle south over the interior and in the
Cascade foothills. We have had some warm days this time of year in
Seattle the last few years. In 2021 Seattle set a record for the
most 70 degree plus days in a row in April between the 15th and
the 21st. In 2016 between the 17th and 20th Seattle had four
straight days of highs in the 80s including the warmest April day
on record in Seattle, 89 degrees on the 18th.

Upper level ridge axis shifting east Friday evening with an upper
level trough quickly moving into the area by 12z Saturday. Flow
aloft splitting a little off the coast which will weaken the
trough as it moves inland. Chance of showers mainly on the coast
and over the North Cascades late. Lows in the 40s.

Upper level trough moving through Saturday morning with another
upper level trough approaching the coast by late afternoon. Air
mass slightly unstable keeping a chance of showers in the
forecast. Much cooler Saturday with highs back in the mid 50s to
lower 60s.

Next upper level trough axis moving through Saturday evening with
a convergence zone over Snohomish county possible behind the
trough. Lows upper 30s to mid 40s.

Strongest and coolest portion of the upper level trough moving
over Western Washington Sunday with increasing shower coverage
during the day. Snow levels lowering to around 3500 feet for a few
inches of snow on the higher passes. Highs in the mid 50s.

Trough axis moving through Sunday evening with a stronger
convergence zone likely over Snohomish and northern King county
behind the trough axis. Still a little early to pinpoint the exact
location of the convergence zone. There is a chance it could set
up over Stevens Pass with snow levels low enough for snow in the
pass. Lows in the mid 30s to lower 40s.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Northwesterly flow aloft
Monday in the wake of the trough. Some residual weak instablilty
in the air mass will keep a chance of showers in the forecast. The
best chances for showers will be in the Cascades and Cascade
foothills. Highs remaining cool, in the mid 50s.

A weak dry upper level trough dropping down from the north Tuesday
will clear the skies over the area. Even with the sunshine highs
near normal, mid 50s to lower 60s.

Upper level ridge building Tuesday night and sticking around into
Thursday. Upper level trough moving south Tuesday night turning
into a weak cut off low to the south of the area Wednesday into
Thursday. Right now this feature remains far enough to the south
to keep any mention of showers out of the forecast. Wednesday
morning will be a cool one with frost advisories possible. Lows in
the 30s and lower 40s. Highs warming Wednesday and Thursday into
the upper 50s to mid 60s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge continues to move over the area
with northerly flow aloft. The air mass remains dry and stable with
generally light to northerly winds. Winds will become light and
variable tonight, resuming as west/southwest tomorrow 5 to 10 kt.
Widespread VFR conditions will persist at all terminals throughout
the TAF period. One exception--hi-res models are hinting at the
chance for some low stratus development along the coast between
around 12-18Z tomorrow morning which may bring a brief period of
MVFR conditions tomorrow morning at HQM.

KSEA...VFR conditions with some high cirrus. Easing north winds this
evening, becoming light east overnight. Winds tomorrow will switch
to southwest 6 to 10 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface ridging will remain over the waters into Friday. A
weak front will slip southward along the British Columbia coast into
area waters Friday night into Saturday. Increasing northwesterlies
over the coastal waters and strengthening onshore flow will bring
solid small craft conditions to many area waters. Seas 5 to 7 ft
tonight into Friday building to above 10 feet late Friday night into
Saturday. In addition, steep seas possible with periods under 10
seconds over the coastal waters Friday into Saturday. A secondary
system will produce a similar result later Sunday into early Monday.
High pressure will then rebuild across the waters early next week.
