Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
747 AM EDT Sun Jul 9 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
A slow-moving frontal boundary with an attendant wave of low
pressure impacts the region through tonight. The frontal wave
tracks east of the area by late Monday, with weak high pressure
gradually build in from the south and west. The center of high
pressure moves across Tuesday night into Wednesday then offshore
for the end of the week.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
Forecast remains on track for this near term update. Only minor
adjustments have been made to temperatures and dewpoints to
account for current observations and trends.

Areas of patchy fog and low stratus that have developed linger
through through mid morning or so. An active afternoon/evening
then looks to be ahead.

The synoptic set up includes a slow-moving boundary, accompanying
frontal wave, and an abundantly moist environment. Into this
evening, a shortwave rounds the base of broad upper trough over the
Great Lakes, with heights gradually falling heights as this shifts
east. A weakening stalled frontal boundary remains just west of the
region into the afternoon, with a secondary front approaching behind
it. Divergent flow aloft will add to the upper forcing for ascent.

A few widely scattered showers and thunderstorms are possible late
this morning across the Lower Hudson Valley or NE NJ, before
expanding in coverage this afternoon and slowly tracks from west to
east through this evening. The greatest instability looks to remain
to the west of the region, though BUFKIT soundings indicate between
1000 to 2000 J/kg of SBCAPE west of the Hudson River, where SPC has
a marginal risk for severe weather with the potential for a few
isolated damaging wind gusts. Of greater concern, the mean cloud
layer flow is largely parallel to the boundary slowly moving east,
which may result in training convection. Combined with ample
moisture, PWATs around 2 inches, heavy rainfall leading to flash
flooding will be the primary threat.

Overall, a widespread 1-3 inches is likely to fall, with
locally higher amounts expected. These amounts are supported by
the 00z HREF, which has the axis of heaviest rainfall over NE
NJ, the Lower Hudson Valley, and SW CT, with 2-3 inches, and
locally higher amounts. However, any training of convection,
even farther east, could produce similar or higher, amounts than
this. There will continue to be some inherent uncertainty with
these types of convective events.

Based on all this, Flood Watch continues for much of the region,
with the exception across Long Island, where dry antecedent
conditions and higher FFG values leads to lower confidence in flood
occurrence.

Flood Watch Timing:

NE NJ/Lower Hudson Valley/NYC - 2pm Sunday until 6am Monday
Southern CT - 6pm Sunday til 2pm Monday

This is in line with WPC, which has expanded the moderate risk of
excessive rainfall to now include NYC, with areas to the east either
in a slight or marginal. The latest collaborated QPF Sunday through
Monday yields 2-3 inches of rain across the interior of the Lower
Hudson Valley and NE NJ with 1-2 across much of the remainder of the
CWA. Locally higher amounts will be likely.

There is also at least some potential for river flooding with this
event, with greatest chances along the flashier streams and creeks.
There still remains uncertainty as to which basins will receive the
heaviest rainfall. Monitor the latest river forecasts for the most
up to date information.

Guidance indicates a wave of low pressure develops along the
boundary as it tracks through the region, likely enhancing
precipitation with additional forcing overnight as it begins to
pivots northeast over the area. Because of this, as well as the
weak steering flow, rainfall is expected to continue into the
night, and likely into Monday, especially for Long Island and
southern Connecticut, but this exact placement is still a bit
uncertain. The thunderstorm threat lessens overnight, though
heavy downpours with a few rumbles of thunder remain possible,
especially for eastern areas.

&&

.SHORT TERM /MONDAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT/...
Into Monday, differences remain with guidance as to just how
quickly the precipitation exits the region. Most CAMs have
shower activity lingering across CT and LI into the afternoon,
with scattered activity potentially extending farther west into
NYC and NE NJ. Given this, maintained the flood watch going into
mid-afternoon for southern CT zones, with locally heavy
downpours still a possibility.

Mid level trough axis moves east of the area Monday night. At
the surface, low pressure is slow to exit, and lingers over
eastern areas into the evening, though there is model uncertainty
on how fast this wave of low pressure exits. Forecast has a
chance for showers and thunderstorms Monday evening into
overnight but the chance for thunderstorms will decrease
overnight into early Tuesday morning. With clouds and rain,
temperatures will be a bit below climo normals, with highs in
around 80. Largely stuck to blended guidance for this period.

&&

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
Mid level flow transitions to more of a zonal through with
slight height rises going through midweek. A less amplified mid
level shortwave moves across Friday with slight ridging resuming
thereafter going into the start of next weekend.

At the surface, low pressure moves farther northeast from southeast
of Long Island to Northern New England into Gulf of Maine vicinity
by Tuesday morning. There is model uncertainty on how fast this
wave of low pressure exits and some model solutions have it closer
to the forecast region than others. The center of high pressure
makes its way across the local area Tuesday night through Wednesday
and then will be moving increasingly offshore out into the Atlantic.
Overall, weather mainly dry Tuesday through midweek.

The next wave of low pressure along with a cold front will approach
Thursday into the start of next weekend. Chances for showers and
thunderstorms return to the forecast.

Forecast hottest day is Wednesday when forecast highs range from
mainly the upper 80s to lower 90s, about five degrees above normal.
Other days will not be as much above normal but still slightly above
normal for high temperatures.

&&

.AVIATION /12Z SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A slow-moving frontal system will approach from the west today
and move across the area tonight into Monday.

Similar to recent mornings expect occasional MVFR conditions
with low clouds and patchy fog across the area, with localized
IFR possible. Becoming VFR shortly after 12Z for most terminals
with with some lingering MVFR stratus into the mid to late
morning, especially at KGON.

Showers and thunderstorms develop ahead of a cold front approaching
this afternoon, continuing through the night. MVFR or lower
likely at times.

Winds will be mainly S-SE near 5-10 kt through the TAF period.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Conditions could vary from VFR to MVFR through about 14Z.

Trend has been to slow the larger area of showers and
thunderstorms that are forecast to move in toward 00Z. There
will likely be scattered activity as early as this afternoon.
Amendments are likely for timing.

OUTLOOK FOR 12Z MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...

Monday: MVFR or lower possible at times. Showers likely. A
chance of thunderstorms day into evening.

Tuesday and Wednesday: Mainly VFR.

Thursday. MVFR or lower possible with a chance of showers and
thunderstorms, mainly afternoon into night.

.MARINE...
Conditions remain below SCA criteria through midweek with a
weak pressure gradient over the area.

Much of the long term period will maintain below SCA conditions on
all waters. For Thursday late afternoon into Thursday night next
week, winds and seas increase with marginal SCA conditions across
the ocean.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
Flood Watch in effect today into Monday, with the exception of
Nassau and Suffolk counties on Long Island, for the potential
for training of showers and thunderstorms along a slow moving
frontal system. This could result in areas of flash flooding.
The greatest threat for flash flooding appears to be across our
western sections of the CWA where WPC has placed a moderate
risk for excessive rainfall. Some flashier streams and rivers
will also be at risk of flooding.

Much of the rainfall is expected to be over by Monday night. Could
still see rainfall amounts near a half inch or less Monday night
especially with any lingering thunderstorms. Overall, a
widespread 1 to 2 inches is expected, with locally higher
amounts between 2 and 4 inches. Otherwise, no significant
widespread rainfall expected mid to latter part of next week.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
There is a low risk of rip current development for all ocean
beaches thru Mon.
