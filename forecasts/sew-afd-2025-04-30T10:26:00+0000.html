.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will build into the region today and
persist through Thursday for warmer and drier conditions across
western Washington. Chances of showers will return on Friday as
the next system moves into the region. Unsettled conditions will
persist into the weekend, before a drying trend returns early next
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge will
build into the Pacific Northwest today and persist over the region
through Thursday, bringing warmer and and drier conditions to
western Washington. With some moisture lingering in the low levels,
satellite imagery this morning shows some areas of stratus developing
along the North Coast and across portions of the interior. Expect
stratus to persist through the early to mid morning hours, before
scattering and making way for more sunshine by the early
afternoon. Afternoon high temperatures today are expected to
approach the upper 50s along the coast and the 60s for much of the
interior.

Warm and dry conditions will continue into Thursday. While overall
moisture in the low levels looks to decrease, a few spots of
patchy fog will still be possible across portions of the interior
by early Thursday morning. Expect any areas of fog to dissipate
rather quickly once the sun comes up for clear skies to persist
through the remainder of the day. Afternoon high temperatures will
climb to roughly 10 to 15 degrees above normal, topping out in
the upper 60s to low 70s along the coast and the 70s across the
interior. A few spots along the Cascade foothills and valleys may
even make it into the low 80s. The lowlands will be warm enough
for widespread Minor (Yellow) HeatRisk.

The upper level ridge axis will then push further inland on
Friday while an upper level trough approaches the coast. A weak
frontal system will then bring the next chance of showers to the
area, with rain likely approaching the coast by Friday afternoon
and spreading inland late Friday into early Saturday. High
temperatures will cool to near normal for areas along the coast
on Friday as a result, with most spots topping out in the upper
50s. Southerly flow aloft will continue to promote warm temperatures
for areas across the interior, however, where highs are still
expected to climb into the upper 60s to low 70s. This will
maintain Minor (Yellow) HeatRisk for lowland areas along the
Sound.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The upper trough will
split apart as it moves inland on Saturday. This will mainly bring
light showers to the region, with most lowland locations only
expected to pick up a few hundredths to around a tenth of an inch
of rain. High temperatures on Saturday will cool into the 50s to
low 60s area-wide. Showers then look to become more confined to
higher terrain by late Saturday night into Sunday morning under
split flow aloft.

There still remains some discrepancy in the weather pattern
heading into early next week. Operational guidance continues to
show another ridge nudging back into the region for warmer and
drier conditions, while ensembles keep chances of showers in the
forecast through the first part of the week. Have maintained
chances of showers in the forecast for now, but will need to see
how this trends in the coming days. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge will build into the region
today with north to northwest flow aloft. Residual moisture will
scatter out by afternoon with increasing low level northerly flow.
Areas of high end MVFR ceilings will lift to VFR by around 18Z with
skies clearing this afternoon.

KSEA...Periods of high end MVFR ceilings this morning will lift and
scatter out this afternoon. Surface winds light and variable early
will shift northerly midday and rise to 7 to 10 knots this
afternoon. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow will ease today as a surface ridge settles
over the coastal waters. The ridge will weaken on Thursday in
response to an approaching trough and associated frontal system over
the offshore waters. A weakening front will move onshore into
Western Washington late in the day on Friday with increasing onshore
flow in its wake. This will likely lead to a period of headlines for
winds across portions of the coastal waters and strait. Onshore flow
will continue into Saturday before easing Sunday as a ridge rebuilds
across the waters.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
