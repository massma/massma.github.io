Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
301 PM PST Sun Feb 2 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough will remain parked over western
Washington throughout the week. Below normal temperatures with
brisk wind chills and continuing snow showers are expected at
times in most areas. Gusty Fraser River outflow winds will begin
tonight and continue into at least Wednesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold low remains
visible on satellite this afternoon over western B.C. Canada, with
lots of wrap around showers spinning around the low from the
Pacific into western WA. The low is expected to remain intact
through at least mid week, as it stalls just off the coast.
There`s no organized fronts, rather the shower activity has been
driven dynamically with cold air aloft, and vorticity max that
swung through WA today. A couple more vorticity maxes will swing
around the low between now and mid week, as the jet stream digs
southward towards CA.

This afternoon: Temperatures have increased into the mid and upper
30s. With peaks of sunshine getting through in between the
showers, this has melted a lot of the snow that fell this morning
in the region. The shower activity continues this afternoon. With
the warmer temperatures, a few of the showers will turn into a
rain/snow mix. Heavier showers will be capable of producing
graupel/small hail and a little thunder.

Tonight/Monday: The beginning of Fraser River outflow is expected
to develop Sunday night into the day Monday, with gusty northeast
winds of 20 to 30 mph possible in Whatcom County. This will begin
to funnel in cooler air into the region. Low temperatures tonight
are expected to range from the low to mid 20s in Western Whatcom
county, to the mid 20s in most rural areas, and upper 20s in most
of Metro Seattle. Confidence in wind chill values decreasing
below 20 degrees increased for cold weather advisory headlines in
west Whatcom/North Coast/West Strait of Juan de Fuca/East Puget
Sound Lowlands. The coldest wind chills in these areas will range
from 5 to 15 degrees in western Whatcom, and 15 to 20 degrees in
remaining advisory areas. The stronger winds up in the Bellingham
area (from Fraser outflow) will likely keep wind chill values at
or below 20 degrees through at least Wednesday. Colder air is
expected to settle into more spots Monday night into Wednesday, so
additional cold weather advisories will likely be needed in
future updates (more widespread wind chills in the low 20s for
Seattle area, and teens in Skagit/Strait of Juan de Fuca). Highs
will remain in the mid and upper 30s in lowland areas.

Now onto snow (in which the Groundhog today said 6 more weeks of
winter): The snow showers again remain scattered in coverage. This
means that additional accumulations will cover smaller pockets of
land (compared to stratiform-type precipitation). The snowfall
accumulations are expected to remain light through Monday
afternoon in most of Puget Sound (less than 1 inch, with best
chance of over an inch towards Tacoma). Most of the accumulations
over an inch (to maybe 3 inches) through Monday afternoon will be
in the Chehalis Valley/Pacific Coast/Hood Canal/Strait of Juan de
Fuca/East Puget Sound Lowlands/Western Whatcom & Skagit
Counties/San Juan areas.

Another vorticity max is expected to swing through the region
Monday night into Tuesday morning. Some of the hi-res models have
picked up on this, with continuation of snow showers into Tuesday.
Additional accumulations were enough to extend the advisory for
the entire Pacific Coast/West Strait of Juan de Fuca areas, and
expand it to the East Strait of Juan de Fuca, as Fraser outflow
enhances snow showers in these areas with upslope winds into the
Olympics. A meso-low might be able to enhance some snow shower
activity that develops east of the Olympics, but confidence is
lower for any advisory level activity at this time.

Each evening/morning timeframe, roads are expected to
thaw/freeze/thaw going from above freezing to freezing and above
freezing again. There will be the potential for slick spots next
few mornings during the commutes (especially on roadways that are
not treated). If driving for work, check road conditions ahead of
time and use caution on slick surfaces.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Ensembles/models are in
good agreement keeping the upper level low in place through
Friday. There may be a more organized trough that swings inland
as the low finally moves onto land by Friday/Saturday. Depending
on placement of the jet stream, this may drive up/down the chance
of precipitation in the region towards the end of the week.
Precipitation chances in the long term are only in the 20-40%
range at this point for additional snow showers. The cold
temperature concerns will likely continue into Thursday
night/Friday morning, as winds decrease and temperatures begin to
rise slightly.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level trough over the region with westerly flow
aloft. The air mass is cool and showery with low snow levels and a
rain/snow mix over the lowlands (turning to all snow tonight into
Monday morning). Meanwhile, gusty N/NE Fraser River outflow winds
will develop tonight across western Whatcom, San Juan islands and
the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

KSEA...Showers in the vicinity this evening, tapering off after
midnight. S winds to 10 kt. Mainly VFR after 06z tonight. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak surface trough will remain over the coastal
waters into Monday. Strong surface ridging over the interior
of British Columbia will lead to the development of general offshore
flow and Fraser River outflow winds late tonight into Monday and
Tuesday - Small Craft Advisories are in effect. Troughing will
remain in place over the coastal and offshore waters with a
strong surface ridge over interior British Columbia through at
least midweek for a continuation of offshore flow. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
