Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
800 PM PDT Tue Oct 22 2024

.SYNOPSIS...An upper level trough stalled along the Pacific Coast
will slowly move inland throughout the week, maintaining cooler
conditions with periods of light shower activity through mid-week.
Weak high pressure will dry conditions out on Friday ahead of wet
and breezy conditions over the weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mostly clear skies over W
WA this evening as per current satellite with some high clouds
creeping up slowly from the south. Temps as of 7 PM PDT shows much
of the area already cooling off into the 40s with a handful of
locations around the sound sitting slightly warmer in the lower 50s.
Will see low-level clouds increasing overnight, both from
aforementioned clouds to the south moving very gradually northward
and from a westerly push of moisture. Timing will be a factor as to
how cold temps get overnight tonight...but progs from both
deterministic and ensemble data suggest that enough clouds will
emerge to prevent temps from getting too low. That said, inherited
forecast looks to be on track with coldest lowland temps only
dipping into the upper 30s over portions of the Olympic Peninsula
and SW interior. For additional forecast details, please refer to
the Previous Discussion section below.

From Previous Discussion...Split flow aloft has allowed for mostly
clear skies this afternoon as a trough continues to slowly
retrograde offshore. Low level northerly flow will allow conditions
to continue drying out throughout the evening hours with highs
reaching 60 for some areas east of the Puget Sound. A marine push
will bring low stratus inland Wednesday morning, with most lowland
areas seeing low temperatures in the upper 30s to lower 40s. Areas
favored to see less in the way of low stratus, including the
Chehalis Valley and Olympia metro area, will see patchy fog and
could even see isolated areas of ice and frost in colder spots.

Westerly flow aloft will increase throughout the day Wednesday and
push the upper level trough back onshore. While conditions are
favored to stay mostly dry, light shower activity will develop
over the Cascades and western Olympics by the afternoon.
Temperatures will dip a few degrees on Wednesday with highs in the
low 50s across the lowlands.

Weak upper level ridging will dry conditions out on Thursday,
though another round of low stratus in the morning will likely
keep most lowland overnight low temperatures above freezing. Highs
Thursday will peak within a few degrees of normal in the mid 50s.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...From Previous
Discussion...High pressure will amplify into the region on Friday
ahead of a deepening trough over the Gulf of Alaska. Offshore flow
will increase throughout the day Friday, which may generate breezy
easterly gap winds in the Cascade foothills. Winds along the coast
and through the Strait of Juan de Fuca will also pick up as the next
storm system approaches.

Wetter conditions are on track to return by the weekend as a deep
upper level trough moves onshore. Forecast models continue to show
potential for periods of breezy winds alongside several rounds of
precipitation. Preliminary rainfall totals show potential for 2 to
4 inches of rainfall over the weekend and into early next week
over the Olympic Peninsula and Cascades, while the lowlands could
see an additional inch or two of rain. Unsettled and cooler
conditions are favored to continue into early next week with
additional troughing over the region.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft will become more southwesterly
with split flow overhead. VFR conditions continue across the
terminals. Low clouds/ and mist/fog will develop again overnight
into early Wednesday, likely bringing MVFR to IFR conditions to area
terminals by 12Z. Low clouds and fog will scatter by 18-21Z for a
return to VFR conditions. Surface winds generally light, persisting
at 4-7 kts out of the north and west. Winds will transition to
southerly again overnight into early Wednesday.

KSEA...VFR conditions continue this evening. Low stratus (with
possible fog) expected to arrive by around 12Z, and will scatter by
18-20Z. Northerly winds 4-6 kts transitioning to the south by 12Z.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will continue to build into the area
waters tonight and will persist into Friday. Patchy dense fog will
be possible across interior waters Wednesday morning and may briefly
bring some reductions to visibility at times through the morning
hours. A strong area of low pressure will move into the coastal
waters Friday night into the weekend and will bring a sharp increase
to offshore flow Friday into Saturday and likely widespread marine
headlines across the area waters. Offshore flow will transition to
onshore Saturday, with a push of westerly winds expected down the
Strait of Juan de Fuca in the wake of the frontal system.

Seas currently hovering between 4-6 feet this evening, and will
continue to subside to 3-5 feet by Wednesday into Friday, before
increasing to 12-14 feet over the weekend. 14/HPR<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
