Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
727 AM EDT Thu Jun 1 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure will remain in control through Friday. A backdoor
cold front is expected Friday night/Saturday morning with an
area of low pressure impacting the area through the weekend.
This area of low pressure may linger nearby through the middle
of next week.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
Forecast update this morning to remove some of the fog and stratus.
Will continue to carry some patchy fog early this morning for
eastern portions of Long Island and SE CT, where some
observations are reporting reduced visibilities. Any of the
morning low clouds and fog should get quickly scoured out with
diurnal heating. Once this occurs, a mostly sunny day expected.
Haze from the wildfires over Nova Scotia will once again be
around.

Winds are pretty light but increase in the afternoon with sea breeze
development.

Used a combination of NBM and MAV/MET MOS for highs today. Expect
temperatures to range from the lower 70s across SE CT and Eastern LI
to middle and possibly upper 80s across parts of NE NJ and Lower
Hudson Valley.

There will be another chance for fog and stratus develop, with best
chances across Long Island and eastern coastal CT. Otherwise, mostly
clear skies can be expected. Lows forecast from lower 50s to lower
60s.

&&

.SHORT TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT/...
Friday, ridging aloft from the west begins to breakdown as a trough
drops south from Canada to New England. Forecast guidance still in
decent agreement that 850 mb temperatures warm into the 16-18C
range. This should allow surface temps to climb into the upper-80s
to lower-90s inland with mid/low-80s for coastal areas. This will
result in Friday being the warmest day of the week.

A pre-frontal trough will also set up of the back door cold front
Friday afternoon. This will bring some instability to the area,
leading to scattered showers and thunderstorms. SBCAPE values are
1000-1500 J/kg from the GFS, but higher on the NAM at 2000-2400
J/kg. Right now it looks like the stronger instability occurs
inland. Can not rule out any small hail with any thunderstorms that
occur.

The backdoor cold front pushes across the region Friday night,
resulting in a period of northeast flow through at least Saturday
night. NE Winds will gradually increase on the day Saturday with
gusts reaching 20-30mph (highest gusts further east).  The northeast
flow will also usher in a much cooler airmass with temperatures on
Saturday in the 60s. Used a blend of NBM/CONSALL for this period.
The cyclonic flow will result in showers across the area on
Saturday and Saturday night.

&&

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
Closed 500mb low meanders near the Northeast coast Sunday and
Monday, and may begin to shift north Tuesday into Wednesday.
Attendant surface low pressure will linger around as well. This will
bring a prolonged period of shower chances each day. Followed
closely to NBM PoPs, capping them at chance, but there are some
indications that rain chances could be lower than the current
forecast, particularly Monday through Wednesday. With the cold pool
aloft coupled with progged warmer lower levels for Tuesday and
Wednesday, greater instability with steeper lapse rates could
promote some thunder both afternoons. High temperatures below normal
for Sunday and Monday, then warming closer to normal for Tuesday and
Wednesday.

.AVIATION /12Z THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure remains in control today.

VFR.

Light and variable winds to start, then SE-S winds under 10 kt
developing by noon. Winds probably become light and variable
once again overnight.

Smoke from Canadian wildfires could limit visibilities slightly
to around 6SM at times today, mainly until around noontime.
Confidence remains low so kept haze and smoke out of TAFs for
the time being.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

The afternoon haze potential forecast is RED...which implies
slant range visibility less than 4sm outside of cloud.

OUTLOOK FOR 12Z FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY...

Friday: Mainly VFR. Chance of showers/thunderstorms and MVFR,
in the afternoon and nighttime.

Saturday: MVFR with a chance of showers throughout the day. NE-E
winds near 10-15kt with gusts near 20-25kt, highest at the coastal
terminals.

Sunday: Mostly VFR, chance of MVFR and showers. NE winds gust around
20kt.

Monday: Mostly VFR, chance of MVFR and showers.

.MARINE...
Conditions are expected to remain below small craft criteria through
Friday, mostly due to a relatively weak pressure gradient over the
area waters. SCA conditions expected on all waters on Saturday
with a strong NE flow. Gusts are expected to reach 30 kt with
seas building to 6-7 ft.

SCA conditions then persist mainly on the ocean waters Sunday
through Monday with gusts of 25-30 kts, mainly during Sunday, and a
lingering swell keeping waves up to 5-6 feet in spite of a NE to N
wind flow.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
No hydrologic impacts expected through early next week.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
A moderate rip current risk is expected Thursday and Friday.

&&

.OKX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CT...None.
NY...None.
NJ...None.
