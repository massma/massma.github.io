Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
313 PM PDT Sat Nov 2 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Unsettled weather conditions will linger over the
weekend with showers continuing, especially in the Cascades. A
stronger frontal system will arrive on Monday for more rain,
widespread breezy to locally windy conditions, mountain snow and
high surf conditions. Drier weather is possible by midweek.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Latest radar isn`t too
terribly impressive for locations east of the Sound, however can
very easily see the next wave of precip along the coast...making for
an active evening and overnight period before PoPs ease for much of
Sunday.

Messaging from both deterministic models and ensembles remains
consistent so no major changes to the forecast. Current radar, as
stated above, bearing out expectations for wet period overnight
which lends support to inherited Winter Weather Advisories in the
central and southern Cascades above 3500 ft through 10 AM Sunday
morning. Much of the advisory area likely did not see too much in
the way of activity through the day...save for the convergence zone
that is only now just fizzling out over the Cascades of King
county...but should see that ramp back up as next wave a precip gets
there during the overnight hours.

A stronger Pacific system is still advertised for Monday, bringing
another round of rain and breezy to windy conditions...especially
along the coast and in the north interior. Mountain snow will again
be an issue, with ensembles in really good agreement that snowfall
would easily meet headline criteria. Said amounts are present in
current forecast, but will hesitate on issuing a fresh batch of
headlines at this time...partly to avoid confusion with current set
and avoid stacking but also to see how current set plays out which
could possibly impact whether or not amounts need to be altered.
There also remains good agreement in getting this front out of the
area Monday evening or overnight. Some lingering moisture will be
present into Tuesday, but PoPs diminish accordingly keeping W WA in
slight chance to chance wording...which would be very reflective or
expected conditions.

Temps in the near term remain pretty static, daytime highs in the
lower to mid 50s and overnight lows in the lower to mid 40s.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Deterministic models and
ensembles remain in pretty good agreement in the mid-week period and
into late week with upper level ridging keeping conditions dry for
Wednesday and Thursday. Start to see hints of the next system
Friday, however ensembles really do not buy into it and even
deterministic models peter it out before it makes any headway into
the CWA. Some degree of confidence that the next system of
consequence will more likely be Saturday. Deterministic models
remain oddly in lockstep with each other and while ensembles
generally agree that there will be something, there is a wide array
of solutions when it comes to precip amounts...serving to limit
confidence.

Daytime highs in the long term will see a nudge upward thanks to the
dry conditions, generally ranging in the mid to upper 50s. But just
as ridges bring warmer days, they also bring clearer, colder nights
and such will be the case here, with overnight lows ranging in the
mid 30s to lower 40s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow will persist aloft as a trough
moves across the area today into Sunday. A cold front will move
across western WA tonight, bringing another round of rain to the
area terminals. Radar shows widespread rain making its way inland
along the coast this afternoon. Expect this rain to make its way
into the interior terminals between 00-03Z this evening. Ceilings
primarily remain a mixed bag of VFR to MVFR, but expect ceilings to
become more widespread MVFR by this evening. MVFR ceilings look to
remain prevalent through Sunday morning, before lifting towards VFR
Sunday afternoon. Winds will generally persist from the S/SW for
interior terminals at 7-12 kt through the TAF period, though may be
a bit breezy as the front moves through. The exception is KCLM and
KHQM, where winds will transition to more westerly and could become
gusty to 15-20 kts at times.

KSEA...Conditions will become more MVFR by this evening. Rain likely
to move into the terminal between 00-03Z. Winds will persist out of
the S/SW generally between 7-12 kt, though gusts to 20 kts will be
possible as the front moves through. Winds then ease towards 5-10 kt
overnight. MVFR conditions look to remain prevalent at the terminal
through Sunday morning, improving towards VFR by Sunday afternoon.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front will move across the area waters tonight,
allowing for northwesterly winds across the outer coastal waters to
increase to 20-25 kt by this evening. Seas across the coastal waters
currently ranging between 7-9 ft will also build to 10-12 ft
overnight into Sunday morning. A push of westerlies down the Strait
of Juan de Fuca in the wake of the front may bring brief periods of
small craft advisory strength wind gusts to the Central and East
Entrance of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and northwesterlies to
Admiralty Inlet on Sunday morning. Winds will ease through the day
on Sunday before another, stronger system approaches the area on
Monday. This system will bring widespread gale force winds to the
coastal waters and to portions of the northern interior waters.
Latest HREF and NBM guidance indicate gusts of 40-50 kt will be
possible across portions of the coastal waters and along the Strait
of Juan de Fuca Monday afternoon and evening.

High pressure will build back into the area on Tuesday will allow
for winds to gradually ease across the area waters. High pressure
then looks to persist into Wednesday, though a weakening warm front
may skirt the coastal waters as it approaches British Columbia. High
pressure will then remain situated over the coastal waters through
Thursday, before a weakening system approaches the region on Friday.

A long period swell being generated by a low pressure system in the
Gulf of Alaska is on track to arrive Sunday morning, allowing for
waves to build to 14 to 18 ft with a dominant period of around 19-20
seconds. Seas then look to rapidly rise towards 18 to 22 ft Monday
morning. Seas will then start to gradually subside on Tuesday,
though likely not subsiding below 10 feet until early Wednesday.
Seas will then hover between 5-8 ft mid to late week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
