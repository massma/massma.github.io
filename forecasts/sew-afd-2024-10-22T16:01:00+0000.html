Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
901 AM PDT Tue Oct 22 2024

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No changes to the overall forecast. Please see the
aviation and marine sections below for updates to those forecasts.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...Drier and cool conditions will prevail across Western
Washington into midweek as an upper trough weakens over the
region. A weak upper ridge will provide mainly dry conditions on
Thursday into early Friday before a broad trough of low pressure
over the Gulf of Alaska heralds a return of wet and occasionally
windy weather for the weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak upper trough remains
over Western Washington early this morning with a few showers
continuing over the northern Salish Sea. These will gradually
dissipate this morning as the trough retrogrades offshore later
today and cuts off with heights rising over the area. This along
with developing low level northerly flow this afternoon will allow
the area to dry out with some sunshine returning. High
temperatures will remain on the cool side...with 50s for most of
the lowlands. With some clearing this evening, some areas will dip
into the 30s tonight and a freeze watch remains in place for the
SW Interior and portions of the lowlands east of Seattle.

An increase in westerly flow to our north will kick the upper
trough back onshore on Wednesday. It`s unlikely to generate much
in the way of precipitation with the highest PoPs over the
north/central Cascades Wednesday afternoon. Weak upper ridging
rebuilds into the area on Thursday for dry conditions across the
CWA. Thursday morning will likely feature another round of chilly
morning temperatures...especially across the SW Interior where
some spots may dip to around or slightly below freezing.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...A weak upper ridge axis is
expected to shift east of the area by Friday morning as a broad
upper trough digs southward offshore. Near the surface, low level
offshore flow is expected to increase on Friday as gradients
tighten between a surface low pushing into the offshore waters and
surface ridging centered east of the Cascades. This will probably
need to be watched as it`s shaping up to be our first potential
easterly gap wind event of the season in the Cascade foothills.

Timing has remained fairly consistent over the past couple days
with ensembles bringing the first of a series of fronts onshore
early Saturday. Saturday has the potential to be a windy day for
much of the lowlands, but how windy will ultimately depend on the
track of a surface low onshore and the ensembles show a
considerable spread with regards to this. A secondary system will
shift onshore Saturday night into Sunday with the trailing upper
trough moving onshore to begin the new week. Snow levels will
begin relatively high, but should fall to the higher passes by
Sunday night into Monday for potential travel impacts. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Currently westerly flow aloft becoming more
southwesterly with split flow overhead. A few showers continue to
linger this morning across the northern Sound as a weak area of
low pressure fills over Vancouver Island. Shower activity is
expected to diminish into this afternoon. Conditions are primarily
VFR this morning, with a few spots of localized IFR/LIFR
conditions across the southern Sound (mainly impacting KOLM and
KPWT). Skies will gradually trend clearer as the day progress
with widespread VFR returning by 21-23z. However, more low
clouds/fog are favorable to develop overnight Tuesday into
Wednesday.

KSEA...VFR conditions expected to continue through the day.
Low stratus looks to move into the terminal Wednesday morning,
with probabilistic guidance hinting at a 20 percent chance of
conditions becoming IFR between 12-15Z. Southerly winds turning
northerly this afternoon, but remaining light at around 4-6 kt.

.MARINE...A weak surface low has moved ashore early this morning,
currently over Vancouver Island. In its wake, high pressure will
build in throughout today and remain in place through Friday. During
this time conditions are to remain on the quiet side. However, on
Friday night a deep area of low pressure will enter the coastal
waters along the potential for a sharp increase in offshore flow and
widespread marine headlines as we go towards the weekend. Seas
remain 4 to 6 ft through the work week, then beginning to rise close
to 10 ft Saturday as that system approaches the area.
