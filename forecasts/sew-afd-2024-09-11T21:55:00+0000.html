.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A low pressure system moving onshore continues to
bring showers across the region today. A few isolated
thunderstorms are expected to develop this afternoon, especially
across the Olympic Mountains and southwest Washington. There will
be a lull in weather systems from Wednesday to Saturday, with
more widespread rainfall likely throughout the day Saturday. A
break in activity Sunday and Monday will be followed with more
rain Tuesday and Wednesday next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong upper level
low continues to progress inland over the Pacific Northwest this
afternoon, with particularly strong meridional flow offshore. Down
at the surface, an occluded front has slowed moving inland from
the Pacific Ocean. This front, along with a trailing surface
trough, continue to provide enough lift to support showers all
morning long.

This afternoon, the lull in activity has allowed for limited
destabilization to take place. HREF ensemble guidance shows
300-400 J/kg of CAPE in southwest Washington (this drops to 100
J/kg in the Cascades). Lapse rates are steady around 6 degrees
C/km. Additionally, temperatures remain cool aloft with 500 mb
temperatures hovering around -16 degrees C. Ingredients will come
together for a few isolated thunderstorms to mix in with showers
this afternoon. The best chance of seeing a thunderstorm this
afternoon will exist around the Olympic Mountains, Chehalis
Valley, and Olympia. There`s a lesser chance in the Cascade
Foothills of thunderstorms. The thunder threat will diminish after
sunset. The storm mode will be pulse-mode, shortlived with a few
lightning strikes and possible graupel/heavy downpours.

Going into Thursday/Friday, the upper level low from Wednesday will
move inland. A transient ridge will break down over Canada rapidly
on Thursday, with strong northwest flow aloft settling in.
Conditions will therefore be dry, but with mostly cloudy skies
prevailing.

Saturday will see a return of active weather across western
Washington. The next upper level low will an accompanying surface
low with a notable cold front. Once this low arrives in B.C.
Canada, widespread stratiform precipitation will spread across the
coverage area during the day. Ensembles show a strong likelihood
of wetting rain, particularly across the north Cascades. There is
medium confidence in isolated thunderstorms with this system
Saturday (depending on how cold aloft it will end up being). Will
continue to monitor the risk for possible hydro impacts over the
weekend.

High temperatures remain constant through the short-term, with
daytime highs in the mid and upper 60s, and lows in the mid 50s.
Winds will be light at or below 5 to 10 mph.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...The system from Saturday
will continue to produce showers through Sunday across western
Washington. Amounts for Sunday are expected to be light at this
time. Dry weather will settle in again Monday and Tuesday, with
northwest flow swapping to zonal. Skies will remain mostly cloudy
during this dry break. Ensembles are picking up on a strong upper
level system passing through next Wednesday. This will be
monitored for possible widespread precipitation chances.
Temperatures will continue to remain steady, with highs in the mid
and upper 60s, and lows in the 50s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough will shift inland tonight and
allow for shortwave ridging to build into the region on Thursday.
This will allow for southwesterly flow aloft to transition to
more northerly by tonight. Radar showing scattered shower
activity across western Washington this afternoon. Expect showers
to diminish across the region tonight. Current conditions at area
terminals are primarily MVFR, though brief reductions to IFR will
be possible in any heavier shower activity. Ceilings may still
lift to low-end VFR by this evening, however expect any improvement
to be rather short-lived. Light surface flow combined with ample
low level moisture will bring the redevelopment of MVFR to IFR
ceilings to the area terminals overnight into Thursday morning.
Ceilings will lift towards VFR again by the afternoon hours.

KSEA...A mix of VFR and MVFR ceilings in scattered showers is
expected through the rest of the evening. Shower activity will
diminish tonight. Expect MVFR to IFR ceilings to redevelop
overnight with ample low level moisture and light flow in the low
levels. W/NW winds 4-8 kt will transition back to S/SW tonight and
become light. S/SW winds will increase to 4-8 kt again by the
afternoon. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak surface low will continue to push inland tonight,
allowing for surface ridging over the northeastern Pacific to
build back into the coastal waters on Thursday. Another weak
trough looks to slide southward from British Columbia late Friday
into Saturday. Ridging will then build back into the coastal
waters early next week. Onshore flow will persist over the next
several days. Westerly winds along the Strait of Juan de Fuca may
increase towards 10-20 kt Thursday night into Friday and may
approach Small Craft criteria at times.

Seas are currently hovering between 3-5 ft over the coastal
waters, but will build towards 5-8 ft over the outer coastal
waters tonight. Seas will then gradually subside again towards 3-5
ft again by the weekend. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak low pressure system will spread additional
showers across much of the region evening. Some modest instability
and cooler air aloft will bring the potential (15-20%) of an
isolated thunderstorm, with the highest chances shifting into the
Cascades. Expect any thunderstorms that develop to be short-lived
and of the pulse variety, putting out only a strike or two before
falling apart. Additionally, additional rainfall with these storms
(60%+ chance of wetting rain in these areas) and abundant antecedent
rainfall should preclude significantly elevated fire weather
concern.  Otherwise, fire weather concerns remain minimal with near
to below normal temperatures and additional round of rainfall
through the week ahead. Cullen<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
