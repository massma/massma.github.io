Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
229 PM PDT Wed Aug 28 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Dry and warming conditions are expected over the next
several days. High temperatures will likely reach the 80s across
the lowlands by the weekend. A weak weather system will bring
cooler conditions and the chance for rain back to the region by
Monday or Tuesday next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mostly clear skies are in
place across western Washington this afternoon. The upper level
trough that brought active weather to the region yesterday has
moved off to the east while ridging begins to build along the
Pacific coast. This ridging will result in dry conditions and a
gradual warming trend that will last in the weekend. This warming
should also reduce the coverage/intensity of morning fog each
morning.

By Saturday, expect highs generally in the upper 70s and 80s
across western Washington. This will result in HeatRisk levels
reaching moderate/orange across many areas. The highest HeatRisk
levels are expected in the Cascade valleys where very isolated
major HeatRisk is possible. At this time, conditions appear
unlikely to warrant any heat products, but we will continue to
monitor the forecast. Warm conditions will continue into Sunday as
the ridge axis slides east of the area.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...By Monday, a compact but
relatively weak upper level low meandering around the eastern
Pacific will get ejected northeast somewhere between northern CA
and southern WA Monday into Tuesday. This will allow cooler
temperatures and a slight chance of precipitation to return to the
area. At this time, there is not a robust signal for significant
precipitation/convection, however again - it`s something we`ll be
monitoring.

Confidence in the details of the pattern decrease significantly
by the middle of next week. However, extended outlooks from our
colleagues at the Climate Prediction Center strongly favor above
normal temperatures and a weak signal for below normal
precipitation.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow aloft as an upper level ridge
begins to build offshore. Current VFR conditions at all area
terminals with mostly clear skies. This trend will continue as we
head into Thursday morning, with some patchy fog possible along
the coast that could effect KHQM with IFR/LIFR conditions.
Elsewhere, VFR will prevail through Thursday.

KSEA...VFR conditions through the remainder of the TAF period.
Northerly surface winds 8 to 12 knots through the evening,
decreasing to around 4 to 8 knots overnight. Winds will then
increase again after 15z and will remain northerly.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will continue building offshore, with a
thermally induced low expanding along the Oregon and Washington.
Northerly wind are expected over the area waters over the next
several days, but will generally remain under any advisory
levels.

Coastal seas generally around 4 to 6 feet into the weekend.

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will begin to develop east of the
Cascades on Thursday with a thermal trough along the coast. This
will allow winds to turn light offshore over the Cascades starting
Thursday. This will allow relative humidity values to drop into the
30s, even as low as 20-25% possible in the southern parts of the
Cascades and valleys. Relative humidity recovery will be poor
overnight, only reaching around 40-60%. Area fuels are currently
moist from recent rains, but these conditions will allow them to dry
out quickly. It will be important to monitor how fast fuels respond,
especially as temperatures warm through late week and instability
looks to increase into the holiday weekend.
