Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
352 AM PDT Mon May 13 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak upper level trough moving through the area today.
Upper level ridge building tonight and Tuesday with the ridge
remaining over the area until at least Thursday. Another upper
level trough moving down from the north could reach Western
Washington Friday through the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Satellite imagery shows
weak upper level trough over Vancouver Island moving southeast.
Stratus along the coast moving inland through the Lower Chehalis
Valley. With the trough approaching middle level clouds are
beginning to increase. Temperatures at 3 am/10z were in the upper
40s to mid 50s.

Upper level trough moving through Western Washington today. Little
in the way of dynamics with this feature with just increasing
cloud cover this morning. Could squeeze out a shower over the
Cascades but that is about it for precipitation with the trough.
Cloud cover and low level onshore flow will keep high temperatures
in the upper 50s to mid 60s.

Trough east of the area tonight with an upper level ridge building
offshore. With the ridge centered well offshore middle level cloud
deck remaining over Western Washington overnight. Low level flow
becoming northwesterly which will restrict the amount of stratus
forming especially over the interior. Lows in the 40s.

Upper level ridge continuing to build Tuesday. As the ridge begins
to shift a little east more subsidence will dissipate the middle
level cloud deck later in the day. Northwesterly flow in the lower
levels will keep temperatures from warming up too much with highs
in the 60s and lower 70s.

Upper level ridge remaining over the area Tuesday night and
Wednesday. Temperatures aloft warming with 850 mb temperatures
going from around plus 8C Tuesday night to plus 10 to 12C
Wednesday afternoon. Low level flow remaining northwesterly
keeping highs in the mid 60s to mid 70s with the cooler locations
near the water. Lows Tuesday night in the mid 40s to lower 50s.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Models still wrestling with
inconsistency in the extended period especially run to run. Both
the operational GFS and ECMWF have a weak shortwave moving by to
the north Thursday. Ensemble solutions not in agreement with the
operational runs with high temperatures just a couple of degrees
cooler Thursday and the shortwave further north. Zonal flow aloft and
low level onshore low cooling high temperatures a few more
degrees Friday and Saturday. Operational runs bring a stronger
trough into the area Sunday but once again the ensembles are not
on board with this idea keeping highs a little above normal with
not much cloud cover. Will add a chance of showers to the Cascades
Sunday but keep the lowlands dry through the period. Highs mid 60s
to lower 70s Thursday and Sunday with highs mostly in the 60s
Friday and Saturday. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper trough axis over Western Washington this
morning will shift eastward with upper ridge rebuilding into the
region later today and tonight. Westerly flow aloft will turn
northwesterly tonight. The low level flow remains onshore. IFR
ceilings along the coast in stratus will extend locally inland this
morning. The onshore flow will produce some weak convergence over
the interior with a few pockets of MVFR ceilings into midday, but
ceilings are expected to be primarily VFR in the 4000 to 6000
foot range this afternoon for interior terminals.

KSEA...Upper trough passing through the region combined with some
weak low level convergence may produce some tempo high end MVFR
ceilings this morning, but confidence in this occurring is not high.
More likely scenario for much of the day ahead will be a persistent
stratocumulus deck around 4000 to 5000 feet. Surface winds expected
to become light S/SW near or after 12Z this morning before gradually
backing to W/NW late this afternoon and eventually light N/NE by
late this evening. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Late spring type of pattern expected with broad surface
ridging remaining centered well offshore with low pressure inland
throughout the week ahead for varying degrees of onshore flow. This
will lead to periods of small craft advisory strength
northwesterlies over the coastal waters as well as small craft
advisory strength westerlies in the central/east strait each
afternoon and evening. A couple of systems passing to the north of
the area late in the week could increase the onshore flow enough to
produce westerly gales in the central/east strait.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...The daily hydrology discussion has ended until the
start of the next rainy season; it will only be updated as needed.

.SEW WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>WA...None.
PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 3 AM PDT Tuesday for Central U.S.
     Waters Strait Of Juan De Fuca-East Entrance U.S. Waters
     Strait Of Juan De Fuca.

     Small Craft Advisory from 3 PM this afternoon to midnight PDT
     tonight for Admiralty Inlet.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
