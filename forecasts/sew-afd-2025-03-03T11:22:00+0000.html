Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
322 AM PST Mon Mar 3 2025

.SYNOPSIS...A series of weak troughs will maintain near-normal
temperatures and bring several chances for light showers across
western Washington through mid-week. The pattern may turn more
active next weekend with potential for an atmospheric river to
bring significant precipitation to the Pacific Northwest, but
considerable uncertainty exists at this time.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A broad upper level trough
over the southwest will continue to move eastward this morning,
being replaced by a brief transitory ridge nudging in tonight into
Tuesday. Latest radar imagery shows a few light scattered showers
over the Puget Sound interior. Light scattered showers will
continue throughout the day on Monday, with the best chances over
the Cascades. Weak convergence today into this evening may locally
enhance precipitation amounts over the central Cascades.

The ridge will build tonight into early Tuesday, allowing for a
brief dry period Tuesday morning. The next upper level trough and
associated surface frontal system will arrive Tuesday afternoon
into Tuesday evening, with showers continuing into Wednesday. This
system will be a bit wetter; a few tenths of an inch of rain will
be possible through the interior, with half an inch up to nearly
an inch over the mountains and along the Pacific coast. With snow
levels near 3000 ft, the Cascade passes will likely see a couple
inches of accumulating snow through Wednesday. Winds will increase
and may become breezy Tuesday night with the low pressure center
not far offshore. The strongest winds will be along the coast and
through the Admiralty Inlet northward, with winds increasing to 15
to 20 mph with gusts up to 35 mph.

Even with cloud cover, these systems will keep the low-level
airmass very moist, allowing for patchy fog to develop in spots
each morning. Fog may be locally dense at times.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...Another upper level ridge
will nose into the Pacific Northwest on Thursday, sending the
upper level trough southward. This will allow for a fairly
pleasant day on Thursday, with dry and mostly clear skies after
morning fog evaporates. Clouds will increase once again Friday as
the next system approaches, but models are still hinting at Friday
also being mostly dry across most western Washington, with the
exception being the Pacific coast. Saturday into Sunday, models
continue to show the setup for an atmospheric river to develop and
take aim at the Pacific Northwest. There remains uncertainty in
the exact placement of the main moisture axis, but models are
beginning to converge on it setting up around southern British
Columbia and into northwestern Washington. This would favor
periods of moderate to heavy rainfall over the northwestern
Olympic Peninsula as well as the north Cascades Saturday into
Sunday, with more active weather favored beyond.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level trough moving east this morning with
upper level ridge building into the area this afternoon. Ridge

southwesterly Tuesday. Increasing southeasterly flow in the lower
levels Tuesday.

MVFR ceilings through this afternoon with IFR/LIFR ceilings in
the Central Puget Sound into the afternoon hours. A mix of MVFR
and VFR ceilings tonight into Tuesday morning.

KSEA...LIFR ceilings lifting to IFR late morning/early afternoon
and to MVFR by 00z. Ceilings could improve to VFR after 06z
tonight. Southerly wind 4 to 8 knots. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the waters today will weaken
tonight. A front will move through the waters Tuesday. Weak high
pressure will rebuild Wednesday and remain through Thursday.
Another front will approach the waters Friday.

Small craft advisory winds beginning in the outer coastal waters
tonight spreading to the remainder of the coastal waters,
entrances to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Admiralty Inlet and the
Northern Inland Waters Tuesday. Winds easing Tuesday night into
Wednesday morning. Another round of small craft advisory winds for
the coast later Friday into Friday night.

Seas 8 or 9 feet today subsiding a little tonight before building
back up to 9 to 13 feet Tuesday into Tuesday night. Seas 9 to 11
feet Wednesday slowly subsiding Thursday before building again to
8 to 12 ft later Friday and Friday night. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No river flooding through Friday. Potential wet
system next weekend could push the Skokomish River to flood stage
by late in the weekend. There has been a lot of variability in
the rainfall forecast for the weekend. This situation will be
monitored closely through the week and could certainly change in
the next few days.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
