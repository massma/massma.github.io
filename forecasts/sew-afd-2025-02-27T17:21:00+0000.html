Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
921 AM PST Thu Feb 27 2025

.SYNOPSIS...A weak front will approach the region today and
dissipate, bringing some light showers to portions of western
Washington. Warm and dry conditions are expected on Friday as
upper level ridging moves over the region. Chances of showers
return over the weekend and will continue into next week as the
upper ridge pushes inland and upper troughing moves into the West
Coast.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No significant changes made
to the forecast this morning. The previous discussion can be found
below along with updates to the hydrology section:

Latest satellite imagery shows some high clouds streaming
overhead across western Washington this morning as a weak frontal
system approaches the area. This weak system will split and
dissipate over western Washington today. While many spots across
the interior will likely remain dry, this system looks to bring
some light shower activity to the Olympic Peninsula, the San Juan
Islands, and areas across the Northern Interior. Precipitation
with this system still looks to remain rather light. Spots that do
receive rain will likely only see a few hundredths of an inch.
Most of the interior is expected to remain dry, with another warm
day on tap. Afternoon high temperatures will be in the upper 50s
to low 60s for areas across the central and south interior and in
the low to mid 50s for areas under more cloud cover along the
coast and north interior.

Warmer and drier conditions are expected area-wide on Friday as
upper level ridging moves back over the region. With some moisture
persisting in the lower levels, could see some areas of fog
develop along the coast and across the interior by Friday morning.
Overnight lows will be in the upper 30s to low 40s, with afternoon
highs expected to warm back up in the upper 50s to low 60s area-
wide.

The upper ridge will then start to push inland Friday night into
Saturday, making way for an upper level trough to move into the
region. While some uncertainty remains in the exact pattern and
track of this trough over the weekend, expect to see increased
chances of shower activity across western Washington. Temperatures
on Saturday will cool a few degrees, with afternoon highs expected
to be in the mid to upper 50s. Morning lows will stay steady in
the the upper 30s to low 40s.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...The aforementioned trough
looks to cut off from the main flow on Sunday, pushing its low
into northern CA and OR. Have kept chances for showers in the
forecast as wrap-around moisture from this system looks as if it
will make its way up back up into western Washington. The unsettled
pattern looks to continue into early next week as the low pushes
further inland across the Western US. Ensembles then hint at a
transient upper level ridge moving back over the area on Tuesday,
before yet another system approaches the region midweek. At this
time, have maintained chances of precipitation through Wednesday,
though overall amounts look to remain rather light. Overall, do
not expect much in the way of any sensible weather impacts though
the long term period at this time. Temperatures will cool a few
degrees, with highs generally expected to trend in the low to mid
50s and overnight lows to be in the upper 30s and 40s.

Saturday into Sunday. A weak trough will remain over area waters
on Monday. High pressure will weakly rebuild Tuesday.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The lower reaches of the Chehalis River are
cresting this morning, with the current observation at Porter
