Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
306 AM PST Sat Nov 23 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper-low continues to churn off the PNW coast
through the start of the new week with active weather. Conditions
will settle towards the the Thanksgiving holiday as guidance
hints at the return drier weather but cooler temperatures.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Good morning, western
Washington. The weekend forecast appears to be rather rinse and
repeat. Conditions are slated to remain active but not as
impactful compared to what`s been seen recently. The upper-low
off the coast will continue to meander and spin showers into the
CWA. Some showers may produce a rumble of thunder or two, mainly for
coastal areas. Guidance has upper-ridging building over the
Inland Northwest on Sunday but we`ll remain under moist
southwesterly flow aloft. Temperatures won`t stray too far from
average with highs in the upper 40s to near 50 F and lows in the
upper 30s to near 40 F.

The upper-low will begin to show signs of progression on Monday.
Deterministic guidance has this disturbance tracking inland during
the overnight period. Again, showers will be the main feature
throughout the day and evening. Temperatures are slated to be
fairly similar to the previous day`s with seasonal values in the
forecast as we start Thanksgiving week.


.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The upper-low will be well
inland on Tuesday as it centers over Oregon. In wake of it,
northwesterly flow aloft will filter cooler air in the area as an
upper-ridge centers over the NE PAC. Conditions are to trend drier
well into the week but NBM is keen on keeping slight PoPs in the
forecast. Conditions are to also trend cooler as widespread 30s
show up in the overnight lows, possibly near freezing towards the
second half of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A stacked low pressure system will remain offshore
today with S/SW flow aloft over western WA. Showers will mainly
impact the coast throughout the day, with isolated to scattered
showers in the interior. The air mass is slightly unstable along
the coast with a chance of thunderstorms too. Ceilings, for the
most part, will remain VFR through the period. 33

KSEA...Isolated showers today. Winds S to 10 kt. VFR conditions
expected.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A 990 millibar surface low west of Vancouver
Island will continue to gradually weaken today as it drifts
slowly toward the northwest. However, winds for the most part will
still remain within Small Craft Advisory speeds for most zones. The
low will fill and drift in the Oregon coastal waters early next
week as surface ridging builds over the interior of British
Columbia. Winds over western Washington remain offshore throughout
the period. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The Skokomish river will remain in minor flood stage
today. But, it`ll be within a half foot of flooding on Monday as
it slowly recedes through the weekend.

For the remainder of the rivers no flooding is expected at this
time. Lower snow levels into the weekend in the Cascades will
limit runoff and reduce any flooding chances for rivers flowing
off the Cascades. Precipitation for the remainder of the period
will come in bursts. This combined with snow levels remaining
relatively low will keep rivers in their banks. 14/27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
