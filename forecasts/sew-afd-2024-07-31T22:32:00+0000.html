Area Forecast Discussion

332 PM PDT Wed Jul 31 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will build over the western US through
the remainder of the week, resulting in much warmer and drier
conditions. Weak shortwaves over the weekend will lower
temperatures a couple degrees before high pressure rebuilds into
next week.

* HEAT: Temperatures will continue to warm into Thursday and
  Friday, reaching the 80s to low 90s by Friday afternoon with
  lows in the low 60s. This will result in prolonged Moderate
  (orange) HeatRisk for much of western Washington.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Much of the region will
see elevated temperatures paired with dry conditions for the
remainder of the week as high pressure over the western US
amplifies northward. Despite cloudy skies persisting along the
immediate coast, conditions further inland will continue to clear
this afternoon, allowing for temperatures to peak near normal
today. Temperatures will continue to follow a warming trend on
Thursday, with the coast and Chehalis Valley seeing the warmest
temperatures of the short-term. Weak onshore flow Friday will cool
the coast with the development of more marine stratus, while areas
further inland will reach the upper 80s to low 90s. This will
result in Moderate (orange) HeatRisk for much of the region on
both Thursday and Friday.

A weak shortwave is on track to pass over western Washington on
Saturday, allowing cloud cover to surge inland which will temper
additional warming. While any chance of precipitation will be
limited to the northern Cascades, the region will see a few
degrees of warming. Much of western Washington will return to
Minor (yellow) HeatRisk outside of urban areas surrounding the
Puget Sound that will stay in Moderate (orange).

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Ensembles remain in good
agreement over hot and dry conditions through the weekend and
into at least early next week, with some long range models
suggesting above normal conditions through next weekend. Weak
troughing offshore will likely ripple a few shortwaves across the
region into early next week, though models still show a large
degree of uncertainty. Conditions through the period will cause
prolonged Minor (yellow) to Moderate (orange) HeatRisk across the
region.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West-southwest flow aloft as an upper level ridge
begins to build into the region. VFR conditions prevail except along
the coast, where MVFR conditions remain as stratus clouds slowly
burn off. A brief break to VFR conditions is possible along the
coast for a brief period this evening, but stratus is expected to
redevelop and persist through the late evening through tomorrow
morning. Stratus should remain confined to the coast tonight with a
weaker inland push. Some low stratus/fog may develop through the
inland river valleys and Cascade valleys, but is not expected to
impact the main terminals. Winds northerly, staying up overnight and
continuing into tomorrow.

KSEA...VFR conditions with decreasing clouds. Winds primarily
northerly, up to 8 to 12 kt and staying windy tonight.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure with low pressure inland will keep
winds northwesterly over the coastal waters. A diurnal pattern of
winds will persist over the inland waters. Winds look to remain
under advisory thresholds.

Coastal seas generally 3 to 5 feet through the end of the week
before gradually building upwards to 6 to 7 feet into the weekend.
With short period waves dominating, seas may become steep,
especially far offshore in the outer coastal zones throughout the
weekend. Seas will subside to 3 to 5 feet in the beginning of next
week.
