Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
358 PM EST Wed Nov 8 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will briefly build across today before giving way
to low pressure tonight. The low and its associated frontal
system will pass through on Thursday. High pressure will then
begin to build in on Friday, and remain in control into Monday.
A weak disturbance will pass through Monday night, followed by
high pressure into the middle of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM THURSDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Bkn high clouds well in advance of the weak low to the west have
already overspread the area. Band of light rain over nrn PA may
expand eastward into this evening and bring some sprinkles to
some interior spots, otherwise low chance PoP with the low
should hold off until late tonight and only just begin entering
Orange County. Temps aloft warm rather quickly and so did not
think sleet would occur at the onset.

Colder NAM MOS temps with widespread subfreezing temps inland
seem too low given dense high cloud cover already over the area.
So used GFS MOS for lows, ranging from the mid 40s invof NYC, to
around for the outer suburbs and along the coast, to the
mid/upper 30s most elsewhere. Did bottom out temps near freezing
in some spots across the Long Island Pine Barrens and across
interior SE CT.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM THURSDAY MORNING THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Light rain is likely Thursday morning as overrunning continues
over the area, especially across the Lower Hudson Valley,
southern Connecticut and Long Island, The weakening parent low
should be moving across upstate NY during that time, while a
warm frontal passage takes place across at least part of the
area, most likely making it through the NYC area and Long
Island, and getting hung up just north of the metro area and
along the CT coastline. Where the front makes it through, high
temps should reach the upper 50s and 60s, possibly upper 60s in
the urban corridor of NE NJ.

The rain should shift eastward into SE CT and ern Long Island
during the afternoon, while a cold frontal passage begins to
take place late in the afternoon from the NYC metro area
north/west, with winds shifting W late afternoon and then NW Thu
night.

Lows Thu night should range from the lower/mid 40s across the
metro/coastal areas, to the mid/upper 30s inland.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A very weak wave of low pressure along a cold front should slide
east and offshore Friday into Friday night. Have kept PoPs
minimal and stayed close to the NBM. For now keeping it dry,
although a shower or a few sprinkles cannot be ruled out on
Friday, especially further east. Clouds should hang in for
awhile Friday before clearing starts to work in later in the day
and evening as high pressure begins to build in from the west.
With the high in control by Friday night look for clearing skies
and seasonably cool temperatures. The high will continue to
build and settle over the area through the weekend. Look for
brisk and cool conditions to begin the weekend, with the winds
gradually diminishing into Sunday. Despite sunshine on Sunday, a
chilly air mass for this time of year will keep temperatures
hard pressed from getting out of the 40s. Light winds and clear
skies should lead to good radiational cooling Sunday night with
widespread 20s a good bet in outlying areas into early Monday
morning.

Into next week high pressure should be in control for the
majority of the time. There is some disagreement among the NWP
deterministic guidance regarding Monday night in the handling
of shortwave energy and how far south it ultimately gets. There
may be enough digging with respect to the vort max heading
towards the region that more clouds and a few showers or even a
few wet snowflakes well N and W cannot be completely ruled out
late Mon night into early Tue morning. For now keeping things
predominantly dry and will wait and see how the guidance trends.
Thus followed NBM closely, but deviated upwards a bit with
clouds for the aforementioned period.

Temperatures will average below normal through the period with
height rises expected late in the period towards the middle of
next week. Temperatures by Wed should return to normal levels
with dry conditions.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /21Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A warm front approaches tonight, moving through the terminals
into Thursday morning, followed by the approach of a cold front
late Thursday morning into Thursday afternoon.

VFR into tonight. MVFR cigs become increasingly likely Thursday
morning from 10Z-15Z. Earlier times likely for northernmost
terminals (KSWF). There is a low chance of seeing high end IFR
Thursday morning for all terminals. The IFR conditions may also
be brief in duration. Highest chances for -SHRA is for KSWF. The
probability of precipitation at other terminals is too low to
include in TAFs at this time. A return to VFR is expected by
late Thursday morning into the early afternoon.

NW flow 10 kt or less continues to diminish this afternoon, with
most gusts having ended for the day. Winds will continue to
shift to the E, SE, then S by Thursday morning, then SW by mid
to late morning. Outlying terminals will likely become light and
variable tonight into early Thursday morning. Winds increase to
around 10 kt for Thursday.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

No unscheduled AMD expected.

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY...

Thursday Afternoon: MVFR likely in the morning and early PM,
then VFR. Low chance of -SHRA.

Thursday night: Mainly VFR.

Friday: Mainly VFR. Low chance of MVFR in any -SHRA in the
afternoon.

Saturday through Monday: VFR.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Winds and seas continue to diminish into tonight as high
pressure slides across, with winds gradually shifting from NW-N
through NE-E by midnight to SE-S late. Attm forecast calls for S
flow at least 15-20 kt and seas building back to 4 ft, but a
several-hour period of SCA conds may be possible in the morning
and early afternoon and possibly the Long Island south shore
bays, with gusts 25-30 kt.

After a cold fropa late Thu afternoon and Thu evening, SCA cond
are also possible Thu night in NW flow on the outer ocean
waters, with gusts up to 25 kt and seas 5 ft.

Sub small craft conditions expected from Fri through the
weekend. W flow behind a cold front on Friday gives way to a NW
flow with gusts at times around 20 kt Friday night into early
Saturday. Ocean seas will be at 2-4 ft to begin the weekend,
and average closer to 2 ft late Sunday through Monday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
