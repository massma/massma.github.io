Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
838 PM PDT Fri Aug 23 2024

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper-low continues to meander offshore as its
center closes in on the Oregon coast. As a result rain and showers
will continue overnight along with the development of patchy fog.
No changes have been made to the inherited forecast. The previous
discussion is below along with an updated marine/aviation section:<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...Cool and unusually wet weather will linger into
Saturday followed by drier more seasonal weather Sunday. Another
shot of unsettled weather will brush the area Monday night into
Tuesday, followed by a return of drier warmer pattern with near
normal temperatures through the latter half of next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...A very moist air mass -
more like October than August remains in place over the region as
an unusually deep upper level low works slowly through the Pacific
Northwest. Have included a low-end chance of thunder over much of
the interior lowlands this evening, supported by NBM
probabilities and the presence of the upper level low and
embedded shortwaves rotating out of it. The best bet for isolated
thunder continues to be over the Cascades this afternoon into the
NBM where HREF 6 hour probabilities peak out in the 40-60% chance
range along the north Cascade crest. Otherwise, widespread light
rain and low clouds will be the norm this evening for most areas,
with afternoon temperatures remaining in the upper 50s.

The upper level low will weaken and meander eastward tonight with
easterly flow aloft. This will allow any evening thunderstorms
over the Cascades to slip west over the foothills before
weakening. Larger scale dynamics look to help keep more widespread
precipitation over the central and northern portion of the area
late tonight into Saturday morning. The NBM continues to show over
80% probabilities of 2 or more inches possible over the northern
Cascades through Saturday morning. Will have to keep an eye on
the Central and Northern Cascade burn scars especially with
possible higher short-period rain rates. Widespread, heavier
precipitation will weaken as the upper level trough move east
Saturday leaving scattered showers in it`s wake Saturday afternoon
- especially over the Cascades.

Increasing onshore flow behind the trough will also make for a
breezy day especially for areas adjacent to the Strait of Juan de
Fuca. Skies will remain cloudy with highs again well below normal
- in the lower to mid 60s. Conditions will trend drier Saturday
night with an upper level ridge building into the area. Low level
onshore flow will keep skies at least mostly cloudy into Sunday
morning, with some sunshine in the afternoon and highs in the mid
60s to lower 70s.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement with another progressive upper level trough moving into
Western Washington Monday night into Tuesday. Another round of
cooler, wetter weather. The grand ensemble continues to highlight
large scale ridging settling into the region midweek and possibly into
the following weekend. This would at least highlight a trend to
more normal temperatures through the later half of next week and
at least August typical sunshine.

&&

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mainly MVFR to IFR in widespread rain and fog.
Precipitation and deteriorated conditions will continue through the
early afternoon Saturday before conditions slowly improve. Surface
winds will remain out of the WSW at 8-15 kt with breezier conditions
along the Strait of Juan de Fuca and northern Puget Sound.

KSEA...IFR conditions will continue through the early morning before
LIFR fog and low stratus set in at the terminal alongside the rain.
Rain activity will taper off in the late morning to early afternoon
with slow improvement and MVFR ceilings remaining Saturday evening.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A low pressure system will gradually push inland on
Saturday. A weak frontal system then looks to move into the area
waters on Saturday, which will be followed by yet another system
pushing into the area waters on Monday. High pressure will then
gradually build back into the northeastern Pacific Tuesday and
persist through midweek.

Winds along the Strait will peak tonight into early Saturday. Latest
guidance continues to show southerly winds increasing across the
interior waters tonight as well, so the Small Craft Advisories for
the Puget Sound, Admiralty Inlet, and Northern Inland Waters for
frequent gusts to 25-30 kt will remain in effect, which are expected
to persist through Saturday morning.

Seas across the coastal waters will generally persist at 3-6 ft
through the weekend and into early next week.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Unusually wet conditions are expected through
Saturday morning especially over the the south slopes of the
Olympic Mountains and west slopes of the King, Snohomish, Skagit
and Whatcom County Cascade Mountains where NBM probabilities of 2
or more inches of precipitation is over 80%. These heavier,
widespread amounts will result in unusual rises and elevated flows
on area rivers and streams. The potential for shorter periods of
even heavier rain rates especially over the Cascades late this
evening into early Saturday will warrant monitoring particularly
for new and existing burn scar areas.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
