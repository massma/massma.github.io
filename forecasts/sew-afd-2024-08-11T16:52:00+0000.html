Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
952 AM PDT Sun Aug 11 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Upper level troughing over the region will persist
over the next several days, promoting onshore flow and cooler
temperatures. Showers will be mainly over the Cascades with a
chance of showers over the rest of western Washington over the
weekend.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Forecast remains largely on
track, with satellite imagery showing stratus has moved into much
of the interior and into the Cascade valleys this morning. Expect
stratus to be slower to scatter out and slower to retreat back
towards the coast today. Spots across the interior will likely see
some sun by 21Z. Do not expect much in the way of clearing along
the coast. A shortwave trough dropping down into the region from
Vancouver Island looks to bring some mid to high level cloud cover
overhead as well. The previous discussion follows below, with
updates made to the aviation, marine, and fire weather sections.

Troughing over the Pac NW will bring cloudier and cooler weather
to western WA today through Tuesday. Expected high temperatures
will be in the 60s to lower 70s with lows in the 50s. There is a
slight chance of showers and thunderstorms during the afternoon
and early evening hours in the North Cascades, especially near the
crest. 33

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Troughing continues
into the rest of the week and weekend as a low drops down from
Canada. Temperatures will be a little warmer and closer to normal
with highs in the mid to upper 70s. The coast will remain in the
60s with NW winds. Showers will be mostly over the Cascades
Thursday and Friday, with showers expanding to the rest of western
WA on Saturday as the upper low pulls in some moisture. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest flow aloft with upper level troughing over
the region. Marine stratus has filled in over most of western
Washington. Ceilings under the stratus are ranging between MVFR to
LIFR, as well as some visibility restrictions at times. Stratus will
be slow to retreat this this afternoon for the interior with a
gradual return to VFR conditions around 18-21z. The coast, however,
does not look to clear out today and will remain under low ceilings
through the TAF period. Another widespread push of marine stratus is
likely to redevelop overnight into Monday morning. Winds will remain
west-southwesterly 5 to 10 kt throughout the TAF period.

KSEA...MVFR to IFR continue this morning at the terminal with
occasional periods of limited visibility in mist/fog. Ceilings will
likely remain in the MVFR category until clouds start to scatter out
around 20-22Z. Skies should be mostly clear and return to VFR by 23Z
this afternoon. VFR conditions remain through the evening until
marine stratus and lower ceilings return once again overnight.Winds
remain southwesterly 5 to 10 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A broad 1032mb NE Pacific surface high is well offshore
but is maintaining onshore flow here across area waters. Steep seas
across will continue today through the outer coastal waters with
waves 6 to 8 ft at 8 seconds. A Small Craft Advisory remains in
effect for the outer coastal waters north of Point Grenville through
this afternoon. Seas subside Monday back to 3 to 5 ft and remain
like so through the week.

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Elevated fire weather conditions will persist
this afternoon and evening across portions of the North Cascades
as another shortwave trough drops into the area and brings the
potential for thunderstorm development. Coverage across the
western slopes looks to be less than that of the previous days,
however any thunderstorms that do develop may produce frequent
lightning, brief heavy downpours, hail, and gusty and erratic
winds. Thunderstorms will be possible across the North Cascades
again Monday afternoon and evening again, however probabilities
wane as the greater threat moves off to the east.

Broader troughing setting up over the region this week will
promote increased onshore flow and good relative humidities across
the region. This will then help alleviate fire weather conditions
through at least midweek. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
