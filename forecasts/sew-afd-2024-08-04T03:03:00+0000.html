Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
803 PM PDT Sat Aug 3 2024

.SYNOPSIS...High pressure aloft through the weekend with
continued above normal temperatures and dry weather. However,
increased onshore flow will bring near-normal conditions on
Tuesday before warming up shortly afterwards. Nearby disturbances
may usher marginal thunderstorm potential over the Cascades into
next week.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Current satellite shows
patchy high clouds in place over much of W WA this evening with a
little bit of marine stratus still clinging to the coastline. Like
24 hours ago, wide range of temperatures being represented via 7 PM
PDT obs, low 60s along the coast and in the San Juans, upper 60s
along the Strait and portions of the north interior with the
remainder of obs from Everett down into the south Sound ranging in
the upper 70s to lower 80s. The 24 hour change in temps is equally
diverse. The coast is on par with yesterday while portions of the SW
interior are warmer. The majority of locations in the south Sound
and Seattle metro are a degree or two cooler.

Inherited forecast looks to be in good shape and see no need for an
evening update. For additional forecast details, please refer to the
Previous Discussion section below.

From Previous Discussion...Latest satellite imagery shows increasing
high level clouds over western Washington as monsoonal moisture is
bring brought northeastward around a large upper level ridge
centered over the Four Corners area. Some marine stratus persists
along the immediate coastline as well. Temperatures across the
region are in the 70s, with 60s along the Pacific coast. Conditions
will remain dry through the short term period as the ridge remains
parked in place. Temperatures will remain above average, with highs
in the mid 70s to upper 80s and lows in the mid 50s to low 60s.
Sunday will likely be the warmest day in this period. Monday will
bring cooler temperatures to the coast as a trough begins to move
into the region. The trough pass through the region on Tuesday,
bringing some relief with temperatures in the 70s to near 80, which
is just about normal for this time of year. Though temperatures are
above normal, HeatRisk values remain Moderate/Orange through the
interior north of Seattle, and Minor/Yellow elsewhere. Additionally,
in this pattern, there will be a very slight (10-15% probability)
for a few isolated showers, which could produce a few lightning
strikes, to develop along the crest of the North Cascades.
Confidence is fairly low at this point, however, impacts are not
expected to be significant.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...From Previous
Discussion...Models are hinting at another warming trend through the
end of next week as the trough departs and heights rise in its wake.
Temperatures look to top out into the upper 80s to low 90s by
Thursday. Another upper level low then looks to drifts southward out
of Alberta/BC towards the end of the week, which may bring
temperatures down closer to normal and slight chances for
precipitation.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>From Previous Discussion...The region remains in between
an upper trough over the northeastern Pacific and a strong ridge
centered near the Rockies, maintaining southwest flow across the
region. Monsoonal moisture remains to the south and east today, with
associated storms passing by but remaining out of the the local
area. Onshore low level flow maintains some stratus near the coast
but elsewhere VFR conditions with only few passing clouds. Onshore
flow should bring IFR marine stratus at least partway inland again
on Sunday morning, but confidence is lower in seeing it fill through
much of Puget Sound.

KSEA...VFR conditions under generally clear skies through evening.
Low confidence in stratus potential for Sunday morning but period of
concern again 12-17z with any shallow stratus likely to linger.
Surface winds light west/northwest through evening, becoming light
southerly again overnight.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>From Previous Discussion...A rather persistent pattern
will continue across the region through early next week with a broad
high pressure remaining offshore and lower pressure inland.
Diurnally driven increases in the westerlies through the Strait of
Juan de Fuca will come close to or exceed small advisory levels on a
near daily basis. Will hold the forecast for this evening at 20 kt,
but expect that an advisory may be needed for Sunday evening.
Persistent northwest winds over the outer coastal waters will
maintain steep conditions over the next few days with seas building
to around 5 to 6 feet.
