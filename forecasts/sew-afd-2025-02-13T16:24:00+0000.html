Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
824 AM PST Thu Feb 13 2025

.SYNOPSIS...A frontal system will move through Western Washington
today, bringing a rain snow mix to locations south of Snohomish
County through Friday morning. A wet pattern is expected to
continue through the weekend and early next week as several rounds
of weather systems are expected to move trough the region,
bringing lowland rain and mountain snow.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Overall no forecast changes
this morning. Dew points across the area where east winds have
prevailed are extremely dry, between 0 and 10 degrees. Dew point
depressions range from 15 to 30 degrees in areas north of Lewis
County. This may greatly prohibit, at least initially this
morning and into this afternoon, how much precipitation is able
to make it to the ground. However, the second round of
precipitation overnight is expected to be the more impactful one
with accumulation. See below for the remainder of the previous
discussion, with an updated aviation discussion. 62

Very cold temperatures expected through Thursday morning. Current
surface observations show temperatures in the the upper 20s to
low 30s. A Cold Weather Advisory remains in effect for most of
Western Washington for low wind chills. The coldest wind chills
will be along the Cascade foothills along the I-90 corridor and
Enumclaw. Gusty easterly winds will drive wind chills into the
teens and even the single digits (60-80% chance) in some
locations. Winds will generally be 20 to 30 mph with gusts up to
50 mph possible through Thursday afternoon. High-resolution
guidance also shows the easterly winds winds making it as far into
the Seattle Metro and Everett, with wind gusts of 20 to 25 mph
possible. Gusty conditions are also expected along the North
Coast, where gusts up to 45 mph are likely.

The next big weather story is the frontal system that is expected
to move into the region today bringing the chance of lowland snow
back into the forecast. High-resolution guidance shows the first
band of snow will start to move into the Southwest Interior in
the late morning hours and will continue to push north into the
metro areas through afternoon hours, impacting the afternoon
commute. The second round of precipitation is expected to push
through late Thursday night into Friday morning, likely as a
rain/snow mix. There is uncertainty on how far north the snow
accumulations will reach; however the southwest interior has the
highest probabilities of seeing snow accumulations of 1 inch or
more (50-80%), with increasing probabilities going south. The
probability of seeing an inch or more of snow decreases going
northward. The metro areas have a 20-40% chance, while locations
north of Everett have a probability of 20% or less. In addition,
guidance shows a small potential for freezing rain (10-30% of 0.05
inches or more) in Grays Harbor County.

Snow showers should begin to taper off Friday morning. Conditions
will briefly dry out Friday night into Saturday morning as a
ridge moves over Western Washington, before the next frontal
system moves into the region Saturday afternoon. This system will
bring lowland rain and mountain snow.

Temperatures are also expected to warm up starting on Friday. High
temperatures on Friday will be in the 40s, with warmer
temperatures along the coast, while low temperatures will be in
the upper 20s to low 30s. By Saturday, low temperatures will be in
the 30s and high temperatures will generally be in the mid 40s
throughout most of Western Washington.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Long-range models show
good agreement that a wet and active pattern will persist through
mid-week, keeping lowland rain and mountain snow in the forecast.
Temperatures will continue to warm up throughout the week. By mid
week, high temperatures will near 50 degrees, while low
temperatures will be in the upper 30s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>South to southwest flow aloft will continue into Friday
as a broad upper level trough deepens over the Pacific. Easterly
surface winds remain breezy this morning across the Cascade
Foothills, but are expected to decrease later this evening.

Widespread VFR conditions continue this morning as high clouds
increase ahead of a frontal system passing through today.
Precipitation has just crossed the OR/WA border, and will continue
to spread northward into Western Washington mid to late morning
(south Puget Sound by afternoon). Precipitation will likely be in
the form of snow (possibly a rain/snow mix for some areas) this
afternoon. Precipitation may struggle to move north of King CO this
afternoon due to continued easterly flow and dry air at the surface.
However, precipitation potential increases a bit more for central
Puget Sound tonight into Friday morning for areas of rain/snow or
snow showers. Increasing mid to high clouds through the morning,
with cigs lowering to high-end MVFR for OLM and HQM later this
afternoon, with more widespread MVFR cigs expected later tonight
into Friday morning. East flow will continue through today,
remaining breezy in some spots near the Cascades, with winds
becoming light N/NE tonight into Friday.

KSEA...VFR cigs with increasing high clouds. Cigs will remain VFR
with increasing mid to high clouds into this afternoon. Expectation
remains that precipitation will arrive after 22z. However, with
substantial dry air at the surface, precipitation will likely be
light if it occurs, with a chance of snow or rain/snow mix this
evening. The potential for light snow then continues later tonight
into Friday morning. The current probabilities of an inch of snow
between 18z Thurs-18z Fri dropped to 30%%. Otherwise, east winds
continue through this afternoon, likely peaking between 16 to 21z,
with gusts of likely ranging around 20 to 25 kts during that period.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Offshore flow continues into this afternoon with
increasing pressure gradients as a weather system tracks towards the
Oregon coastline today. Small Craft Advisory winds continue for the
majority of the Coastal Waters, as well as the central and western
Strait of Juan de Fuca during this period. East winds will slowly
taper off later this afternoon into this evening, with increasing
northerly winds along the outer Coastal Waters Friday morning.
Another frontal system will bring increasing southerly winds
Saturday into Saturday night, with additional headlines likely for
the Coastal Waters, and some portions of the interior waters as
well. The unsettled weather pattern will continue with additional
systems possible next week.

Seas will be 7 to 11 feet for the Coastal Waters today through
Friday. Seas will briefly subside below 10 feet Friday night into
Saturday morning before building again to 10 to 14 feet Saturday
with the frontal system moving across the area. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
