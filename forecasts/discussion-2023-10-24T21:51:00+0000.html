Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
551 PM EDT Tue Oct 24 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure remains in control through Friday. A slow moving cold
front then approaches from the north and west this weekend, moving
through early next week.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Any lingering mid level clouds dissipate after dark this
evening as high pressure remains situated just to the south and
east of the region. Forecast remains on track and previous
discussion follows.

High pressure over the region will result in clear skies and
light winds tonight. This will result in good radiational
cooling, with overnight lows falling into the 40s across much
of the forecast area, with NYC metro remaining in the lower to
middle 50s. A few of the far outlying locations in Orange County
may see some low temperatures in the middle to upper 30s. If
temperatures do drop this low, expect some frost to develop. No
headlines are expected with the frost, with less than half the
county expected to see frost development.

Followed a NBM/MAV/MET blend for overnight lows.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
Ridging builds into the region during the short term period
with a continued warming trend expected. While it will be sunny
skies to start, a mid-level shortwave will pass along the
northern periphery of the ridge, resulting in an increase in
cloud cover for the second half of Wednesday into Wednesday
night. Despite the cloud cover, conditions will remain dry.

Temperatures on Wednesday will be in the upper 60s to lower 70s,
with lows Wednesday night in the upper 40s and 50s.

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
Ridging remains anchored over the Eastern US late week, maintaining
dry, mild conditions into the weekend. Persistent SW flow will
transport a milder air mass into the region, with 850 mb
temperatures progged at +13C to +14C Thursday through Saturday. This
will translate to several afternoons in the 70s at the surface, or
about 10 to 15 degrees above climatological normals. Temperatures
could approach daily record highs, particularly on Saturday. See
climate section for more details.

Weak shortwave passes around the ridge well to the north early
Thursday, and another Friday into Saturday. This may allow for a bit
of extra cloud cover, but conditions look to remain mostly, if not
entirely, dry locally. By the weekend, troughing begins to dig into
the Upper Great Lakes, as the ridging in place gets shunted to the
south and east. On the leading edge of this trough, a cold front
will attempt to slowly advance eastward. This boundary may backdoor
the region from the north on Sunday as a wave of low pressure rides
along it, as hinted by some of the global models, before working
back north as a warm front. Model differences remain early next week
with the timing/progression of the front clearing the region. For
now, increasing rain chances as the front slowly approaches early
next week, though kept PoPs capped at chance (40% to 45%) Sunday
through Monday given the uncertainty at this point. A much cooler
air mass looks to advect in behind the front, sometime early to mid
next week. Largely stuck close to the national blend for this
update.

&&

.AVIATION /22Z TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
