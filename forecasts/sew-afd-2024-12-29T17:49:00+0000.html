.SYNOPSIS...The next frontal system will move into the region
from the south today, bringing lowland rain and mountain snow to
western Washington. Showers will linger into Monday, however
expect a gradual drying trend to commence and persist into Tuesday
for a brief break in the active weather pattern. The active
weather then returns mid to late week as additional systems move
into the region.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The next round of lowland
rain and mountain snow is currently moving across western
Washington from the south, with radar showing light showers
present across the area. Expect this precipitation to continue to
make its way northward through the day as a weak low pressure
system over the coastal waters moves inland across the region.
Overall, expect rainfall accumulations of roughly a quarter of an
inch to half an inch for the majority of the lowlands, though
areas along the Pacific Coast could see locally higher rainfall
amounts of up to three quarters of an inch.

Additional rounds of snow are expected for the mountains, with
accumulations expected at the passes. Snow levels will fall
throughout the day and will generally hover between 2500-3000
feet tonight into Monday. The majority of the moisture with this
system remains focused on the south and central Cascades, with snow
accumulations of 8-12 inches expected for Snoqualmie and Stevens
passes. Though, locally higher amounts are possible further south
for White Pass. Hi-res guidance does continue to hint at some
convergence zone banding setting up across the central Cascades by
this evening, which could bring locally higher snow amounts and
rates of up to 1 inch per hour to areas that fall underneath this
banding. Lighter accumulations are expected for the Olympics and
North Cascades, though snow amounts across the North Cascades may
bear watching.

Showers will linger into Monday as an upper level trough swings
across the area, though expect a gradual drying trend to commence
with rain and mountain snow gradually tapering throughout the
day. A transient upper ridge will then move into the area on
Tuesday, which will provide western Washington with a brief break
in the active weather pattern. Brief is the key word here, however,
as the next system is slated to approach the region Tuesday night
into early Wednesday.

Lastly, the potential for minor coastal flooding will need to
continue to be monitored throughout the week as the next round of
perigean spring tides occur - especially for areas along the
Strait of Juan de Fuca and the northern interior waters. At this
time, weather does not look to exacerbate flooding concerns in the
the immediate near term, however will need to monitor this trend
heading into the second half of the week.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Active weather returns
mid to late week as additional systems move into the region. The
next system will move into the area on Wednesday, bringing the
next round of lowland rain and mountain snow to western Washington.
Warmer systems late in the week may allow for snow levels to rise
between 4000-6000 feet. At this time, expect unsettled conditions
to persist throughout the long term, with additional rounds of
lowland rain, mountain snow, and breezy conditions. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Lower ceilings, mixed between lower MVFR and IFR,
continue across most of the region this morning as the warm
front lifts north. Expect pockets of reduced visibility in rain
through the morning. Surface winds will return to predominately
southerly or southeasterly across the region, with gusts
increasing late morning through afternoon.

KSEA...Residual IFR ceilings this morning but gradual improvement
to a lower MVFR overcast deck with warm front lifting. Expect some
light rain that may briefly lower visibility at times. Predominantly
southeast surface winds, with some gusts to around 20 kt later today
toward 00z as front pushes through.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The next front is arriving across southern coastal waters
early this morning, keeping seas around 10 feet with showers and
isolated gusty conditions. Current SCA headlines will remain over
the coast and west entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca until late
this morning, but will be focused on elevated seas rather than wind
speeds. Seas thereafter will ease below 10 feet whilst between
weather systems and the SCA will be allowed to expire. After a bit
of a lull early in the week, the next front will reach the waters
later Tuesday into Wednesday and bring a better chance at more
substantial advisory winds to the coastal waters and the eastern
Strait of Juan de Fuca.

.HYDROLOGY...Additional precipitation is expected today into
Monday as another weather system moves into western Washington.
Currently, the Skokomish is the only river in flood and forecast
to remain in flood stage over the next few days. The Chehalis
River has crested downstream at Grand Mound, and the forecast
keeps the river at action stage at Porter. A break in the rain
will allow for rivers to recede later Monday into Tuesday before
an active, wetter period begins again mid to late week. Several
inches of rain will be possible over the Olympic Peninsula through
late next week, bringing the potential for additional rises on
Olympic area rivers.
