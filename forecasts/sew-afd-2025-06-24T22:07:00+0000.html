Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A series of weak systems passing mainly to the
north Wednesday through Friday will bring a cloudier and cooler
pattern through the remainder of the work week. A return of
higher pressure this weekend will bring sunnier and warmer
conditions into the first part of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Warm temperatures
this afternoon despite the abundant high clouds will extend into a
mild evening. As advertised the large scale pattern leaves Western
Washington on the edge of a series of weak upper level systems
passing mainly to the north through Friday. The first will move by
to the north late tonight into Wednesday with  increased low level
onshore flow and mostly cloudy to cloudy skies by morning and a
slight chance of showers for most of the area Wednesday. Highs will
trend cooler with most locations remaining in the 60s. The second in
the series will brush the area Thursday, perhaps resulting in a
little more widespread potential for light showers and continued
cooler high temperatures.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The third weak feature
expected to brush the area Friday keeping a chance of showers in the
forecast and highs in the 60s. The pattern will begin to shift with
upper level ridging beginning to build into Washington Saturday,
helping weaken low level onshore flow and setting up a  warming
trend into early next week. High temps will return to the mid 60s to
mid 70 Saturday then 70s and lower 80s over much of the interior
Sunday. Monday looks to be the warmest day with the upper level
ridge starting to drift east with interior temperatures continue to
warm with highs in the mid 70s to mid 80s and highs near 70 along
the coast.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>VFR conditions expected to prevail this afternoon into
tonight, with the exception of KHQM. Cloud cover will continue to
increase this afternoon/evening ahead of a weak cold front, and
ceilings are expected to lower early Wednesday morning for all
terminals. MVFR conditions are expected for interior terminals after
10Z Wednesday, with IFR conditions possible (20-35% chance).
Improvement is possible in the in the evening, but it may be
shortlived. Guidance currently hints at seeing a short window (3-4
hours) for VFR ceilings after 22Z, with the exception of the coast,
as lowered ceilings are expected to persist through the TAF package.
This frontal system may bring some light scattered showers to the
terminals, but confidence is not high enough to include them in the
prevailing line.

Generally W/NW surface winds this evening, with breezy conditions
along the Strait of Juan de Fuca as another round of evening
westerlies pushes through. Winds will become more SW overnight for
Puget Sound terminals.

KSEA...VFR conditions expected today. Conditions will deteriorate
overnight as ceilings are expected to lower down into MVFR early
Wednesday morning after 9Z-11Z. Guidance hints at a 25% chance for
IFR ceilings as well. Conditions may rebound WEdnesday afternoon
after 21Z-22Z, but it looks like it may be for 3-4 hours. Ceilings
will lower once again Wednesday late night after 3Z. WSW winds will
become more SSW overnight with winds generally between 6-8 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow will persist over the next several days, with
westerly pushes across the Strait of Juan de Fuca each evening of
varying degrees. Tonight`s push across the Strait has a Small Craft
Advisory in effect through early Wednesday morning. A weak frontal
system will move over the waters on Wednesday, with surface winds
becoming southwesterly behind the front. High pressure will rebuild
over the waters late in the week into the weekend, with northwest
flow establishing over the coastal waters. Seas will generally be
around 3-4 ft throughout the week and will increase slightly into
the weekend to 4-6 ft.
