Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
236 PM PST Fri Feb 14 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A few showers will continue to linger along the coast
Friday afternoon as an upper level low exits the region. A more
organized system will bring substantial rain in the lowlands, and
snow in the mountains through the weekend. The wet weather will
continue into next week, with Wednesday being the wettest day of
the work week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak upper level trough
is exiting the region this afternoon. A small perturbation has
provided enough lift to produce some showers along the Pacific
Coast this afternoon. Otherwise conditions have dried out across
much of western WA this afternoon, with most areas seeing cloud
cover. Some partial clearing has taken place to the northwest,
with some gravity waves also visible over the Cascade and
Olympics. A ridge will also sneak in between today`s trough and
another low dropping down later this weekend. This will keep most
areas dry through Saturday morning. Lows tonight will remain at or
above freezing in the lowlands.

This weekend: An organized shortwave trough is expected to drop
southeastward to just off the coast of Washington by Sunday. A
couple of frontal systems with this low will produce areas of
precipitation. Best timeframe for substantial accumulating
precipitation will be from Saturday afternoon into Sunday
night/Monday morning with a warm/cold front swinging through. The
warm front is expected to lift snow levels up from roughly;y
1,500 ft to 4,000 ft (3,000 ft for the Cascades). This will result
in the lowlands only receiving rain with this system. Most areas
are expected to receive between 0.50-0.75 in with this system into
Monday (though ensembles range from (0.25 up to just over an inch
in places like Seattle, so still some uncertainty with exact
amounts but the addition of Hi-Res guidance tonight into Saturday
should help optimize the forecasted precipitation amounts).

Snow with this system is going to be focused in the Cascade
Foothills and the higher elevations of the Olympics. The snow is
expected to begin Saturday afternoon and last into Monday, but the
most impactful period will be snow that falls Saturday night into
Sunday (when most of the accumulations are expected). Snow amounts
have quite a bit of variance between min and max, but the mean for
both Snoqualmie and Stevens Passes have just under under 12 in of
snow forecasted in these areas. Again some uncertainties with the
NBM are: how soon will west winds bring the snow levels up, and if
there will be the potential for any freezing rain to mix in
between North Bend and Rainier. The latest HREF guidance (going
into early Sunday morning) shows most likely a few hundredths of
an inch in pockets of the Cascades (again between North Bend and
Rainier), and higher elevations of the Olympics. Given potential
impacts over the weekend, a winter weather advisory will be issued
from Saturday afternoon into Monday morning. Travels through the
passes should check road conditions and prepare for slippery
roads.

High temperatures over the weekend will jump back up to the upper
40s to 40 towards the end of the weekend, with lows improving up
to the upper 30s and low 40s.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The wet pattern will likely
continue into much of the work week. Ensembles are hinting at
above average temperatures from next Wednesday into next weekend
(with cooler air pushing east out of the region). There will be
potential for another system Wednesday brining more precipitation
into the region (rain in the lowlands, and snow in the mountains).
A few more areas will see highs in the upper 40s and low 50s
towards the end of next week.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A storm system will move into western Washington over
the weekend, bringing in 1 to 2 inches of liquid precipitation to
the region through Monday. Rivers are expected to rise with this
incoming precipitation, but widespread river flooding impacts are
not expected. The Skokomish River is favored to rise into Action
Stage by Saturday afternoon and remain elevated through next week,
but is not forecast to flood at this time.
