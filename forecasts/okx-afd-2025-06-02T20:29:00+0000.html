Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
Issued by National Weather Service Mount Holly NJ
429 PM EDT Mon Jun 2 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Offshore high pressure remains through midweek. High pressure
then weakens, allowing for a frontal system to approach from the
west. The associated cold front enters within the area late this
week and may linger nearby through the weekend before moving
east of the area early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM TUESDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface trough moves across this evening. High pressure then
builds thereafter but will have its center well south of the
region. This will keep a relatively warmer airmass in place.
Despite light northerly winds and mostly clear sky conditions,
lows tonight expected to be several degrees warmer than the
previous night, ranging from mid 40s to upper 50s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Offshore high pressure remains with dry conditions continuing.
The region becomes established with a persistent SW flow. Warm
air advection will increase as a a result. Tuesday`s forecast
highs are about 5 to 8 degrees warmer than the previous day,
ranging from upper 70s to lower 80s for a majority of the
region. Tuesday night, likewise, expect the warming trend to
continue as lows just will be mainly from lower 50s to lower
60s.

Side note, there has been recent smoke aloft reported from
Canadian wildfires. This has resulted in some haze in the sky
but not significant enough to result to reduced visibilities at
the surface. The HRRR model shows a relative increase smoke
Tuesday afternoon through Tuesday night so perhaps another hazy
sunset is in store for Tuesday evening.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The synoptic ridge pattern gradually shifts to more of a trough
structure with rain eventually returning to the forecast late
week and towards the weekend.

Warming trend continues to start with the warmest forecast
temperatures Wednesday through Friday, with upper 80s to near
90 for some locations. Lower temperature trend thereafter with
more rain shower chances in the forecast and eventually more
northerly flow late weekend into early next week.

There is a slight chance of thunderstorms Thursday, Friday as
well as the first half of the weekend. The more trough synoptic
pattern will allow for greater moisture in the atmosphere with
higher PW values. With warmer temperatures forecast Thursday and
Friday, more low level instability would be available for
thunderstorm growth.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /20Z MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
A weak surface trough moves across early this evening. High
pressure then builds in and quickly offshore through Tuesday.

VFR conditions remain through the TAF period. Winds near 10 kts
or less through the TAF period. Some gusts to 20 kt are possible
this afternoon but probably only occasional in frequency. Sea
breeze has developed at some terminals with more S-SW flow near
10 kt. Other terminals have W-NW flow. Wind direction is
variable to NW flow tonight into early Tuesday.

Expecting more sea breezes Tuesday afternoon along with slightly
higher wind speeds. All terminals get to more southerly
component with winds Tuesday but KSWF likely stays more
westerly.

Smoke aloft from Canadian wildfires may be observed but is
expected to impact low level visibility.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Amendments possible pertaining to the timing of the sea breeze
and if gusts become more frequent.

.OUTLOOK FOR 18Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

Tuesday: VFR. S-SW wind gusts to near 20 kt possible in the
afternoon.

Tuesday night through Wednesday: VFR.

Thursday: Mainly VFR.

Friday: Possible MVFR/IFR with chance of showers/tstms.

Saturday: Possible MVFR/IFR with showers likely. Chance of
tstms.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Conditions expected to remain below SCA thresholds on all waters
through Thursday night.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No hydrologic concerns through midweek. Late week, there are low
probabilities for thunderstorms and forecast models indicates PW
values near 1.5 to 1.75 inches. Some locally heavy rain is
possible, especially with thunderstorms, with minor flooding
possible.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
