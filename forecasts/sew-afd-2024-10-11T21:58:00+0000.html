Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Lingering clouds will clear out late Friday afternoon
and evening as high pressure builds over Washington this weekend.
This weekend will be completely dry and warm for this time in
October, with highs climbing into the 70s for most areas under
mostly clear skies. The pattern changes however going into next
week, as two atmospheric rivers are expected to bring widespread
precipitation into the region.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level analysis shows
a cutoff low passing south over the Oregon/California state line,
and a ridge beginning to build, with the axis over the British
Columbia coastline. The cutoff low has been the main culprit today
for the high clouds as it skirts by to the south. There`s a couple
weak isolated showers moving over the Olympics/Puget Sound this
afternoon. A majority of the drops will evaporate on their way
down, but cannot rule out a couple of sprinkles heading out this
afternoon. Cloud cover will begin to clear out later tonight as
the cutoff low departs the region.

This weekend looks especially nice (particularly Saturday), with
skies being almost completely clear. With the high pressure
building in southern British Columbia/Alberta, this will help
increase temperatures for the weekend. There again may be patchy
fog in low-lying areas Saturday and Sunday morning, but this is
expected to be less widespread than Friday morning. This may be
the last sunny/70 degree weekend of the season, as the pattern
shifts to active weather next week.

By late Sunday, the pattern changes to a more common fall pattern
seen in our region. A large-scale upper level low will slowly
rotate down the Pacific Coastline from just south of Alaska, to
northwest British Columbia. There will be a subtle trough passing
over the state Monday, with a weak cold front passing through.
This system has characteristics of being a weak atmospheric river
(getting into the theme of fall/winter as there is significant
height falls with the approach of this low). Rain chances will
increase during the day Monday as the front passes through. The
amounts of precipitation with this first atmospheric river are not
expected to be significant, with lowland areas receiving a quarter
to a half an inch Monday through Tuesday, and half an inch to
three quarters of an inch along the coast/west Olympics, and north
Cascades.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Most ensembles are now
agreeing on a wet pattern continuing through the remainder of next
week. They show the deep low over Alaska drifting inland Wednesday
into Friday, carving out a deep trough across much of the Pacific.
Once the main trough passes through, the jet pattern will continue
to funnel in moisture across the region (as an atmospheric river).
Probabilities are increasing for significant precipitation
totals from late Tuesday into Friday with this second system.
This may change however between now and next week as model
guidance improves the predictability of potential totals. Cooler
air will follow with this atmospheric river/front, resulting in
snow levels dropping to around 4,000 feet. Snow accumulations will
be possible at the higher elevations (including Stevens Pass).

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwesterly flow becoming southeasterly tomorrow as
an upper level ridge remains over the area as well as an upper level
low moving through Oregon. VFR conditions prevail this afternoon
with high clouds blanketing the area. Scattered high clouds will
remain over the area this afternoon and into tonight though
decreasing in coverage. Light winds tonight should allow for cooling
and the development of shallow fog and low stratus.
Highest probabilities (40-50%) for fog exists at KOLM, KPWT, and
KPAE, through probabilities for fog are up to 25-35% at KSEA, KBFI
and KBLI. Currently have at least a brief period of fog and low
ceilings mentioned at all of the listed terminals. Any fog that
develops should scatter out quickly by tomorrow morning. Winds
remain light (less than 5 kt) north/northeasterly this afternoon,
switching to light southerly tonight into tomorrow.

KSEA...VFR conditions with high clouds overhead. There is a 25-35%
chance for LIFR conditions between 09Z-15Z Friday. Fog could form as
early as 06Z and linger through 18Z, in a similar evolution to this
morning. Conditions return to VFR tomorrow morning after any fog
evaporates. Winds remain light through the TAF period (less than 5
kt), N/NE tonight then switching to having a southerly component
tomorrow morning.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure offshore to the southwest with a high
pressure ridge over western Washington this weekend will maintain
offshore flow through Saturday. Easterly flow will be enhanced
coming out of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and near Grays Harbor, but
will remain below Small Craft Advisory thresholds. A frontal system
will approach the area Sunday afternoon into Sunday night, with a 50-
70% chance of seeing SCA winds through the outermost coastal waters.
This front will pass through the waters Monday morning. Another
frontal system will pass through the area on Tuesday. This currently
looks to be the stronger of the two fronts, with another round of
gusty winds across the waters as well as a post-frontal push of
westerly winds down the Strait of Juan de Fuca on Wednesday.

Seas 3 to 4 ft this evening will build to 5 to 7 ft tomorrow through
Sunday. As the first system approaches on Sunday night, seas will
rise to 11 to 13 ft by early Monday. Seas subside below 10 ft by
Tuesday before rising up again to 10 to 12 ft on Wednesday as the
next system moves through.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Signals for two atmospheric rivers early next week are
appearing in the forecast. The first will arrive late Sunday night
into Monday, and a second following in short succession Tuesday into
Wednesday. The second one looks to be somewhat stronger in terms of
integrated water vapor transport into western Washington. The
concern with two atmospheric rivers over a short duration relates to
flooding and the QPF will need to be monitored closely over the next
few forecasts in order to determine which basins are at most risk
for elevated river flows or possible flooding. As of now, there are
no area rivers expected to rise into action or minor flood stage.
