Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
835 PM PDT Wed Jul 24 2024

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A fire start on Vancouver Island is sending some haze
and light smoke towards the San Juan Islands and up towards
western Whatcom county. With the fairly strong winds tonight, not
expecting any dense smoke in the area, but will continue to
monitor for smoke. Otherwise, no other updates to the
forecast. See below for an updated aviation discussion.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...Upper level trough over Western Washington through
Thursday with a chance of showers north part. A weaker trough
will take its place over the weekend into the first part of next
week. Temperatures will be close to normal.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...An upper level low and
onshore flow will give western WA generally mild weather over the
next few days. Temperatures are in the 60s (coast) and 70s
interior or close to late July normals. We will see a few showers
as the trough moves overhead tonight and Thursday, with showers
mainly over the coast and mountains. The North Cascades have the
best shot at seeing wetting rains. Thursday will be a few notches
cooler although still seasonably mild.

A weak trough will remain over western WA Friday and Saturday as
the upper low shifts NE toward northern Alberta/Saskatchewan.
Temperatures will continue to track close to normal through the
period.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Troughing remains over the
region on Sunday for a repeat of mild, late July weather. We may
tap into some moisture over the Pacific early next week (Mon-
Tuesday night) for a chance of showers. There`s a 70% chance of
seeing measurable precipitation through the period in the
lowlands. The mountains have a 60-70% chance of seeing wetting
rains (0.25" or more). Temperatures nudge upwards Wednesday
afternoon with broad ridging over the Rockies. Around half of the
ensemble runs have interior lowland temperatures in the lower 80s
again. 33

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mostly VFR with strong onshore flow and increasing mid
level ceilings this evening. West/southwest flow aloft with a large
upper level trough over the region. Surface winds will generally
turn NW to NE tonight as a frontal system moves to the east,
returning back to SW tomorrow and gradually turning back to N
Thursday evening. Increasing convergence overnight may allow for
MVFR ceilings over Snohomish and Skagit counties, with low-end VFR
ceilings expected elsewhere. Skies will clear out and lift
throughout the day tomorrow, with a return to VFR conditions
everywhere tomorrow.

KSEA...VFR through the period with a low (10% to 15%) chance of MVFR
ceilings developing early Thursday morning. Northwest winds this
evening will shift N/NE overnight and return to SW by Thursday
morning. Winds will again gradually turn from southwesterly to
northwesterly over the course of the day Thursday, with speeds
generally remaining in the 6 to 11 kt range with an occasional gust
to 18 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A series of weak surface fronts will slide eastward
tonight and into Thursday with an upper level trough over the
region. This will cause westerly pushes through the Strait of Juan
de Fuca and into the Admiralty Inlet, and the existing Gale Warning
for the Central and Eastern Strait and Small Craft Advisory for
Admiralty Inlet remain in effect through Thursday morning.
Additional westerly pushes down the Strait will continue through
this weekend and into next week. Some may require additional
headlines but none look to be as strong as tonight at this time.

Seas remain 3 to 6 ft into next week.

.FIRE WEATHER...We`re continuing to see benign fire weather
conditions for the next several days. Stout onshore flow off the
Pacific will keep concerns to a minimum. Isolated pockets of
critical RH values are possible in the Cascade zones of 658 and 659
but, decent overnight recoveries are expected. 20-40% chance of
showers overnight Wednesday into Thursday morning for the Northern
Interior with little to no chance of wetting rain. The next threat
for precipitation is favored to arrive Monday-Tuesday of next week
with a better chance of wetting rain as widespread precipitation
looks to be at play in what`s climatologically the driest time of
the year.
