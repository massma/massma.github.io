Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
233 PM PST Thu Jan 9 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The next round of lowland rain and mountain snow will
arrive on Friday as a trough moves through the Pacific Northwest,
with showers lingering through the weekend under moist northwest
flow. Drier conditions are forecast to return by early next week
as high pressure rebuilds.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A mix of sun and clouds
today with high pressure over the region. Temperatures are in the
40s to lower 50s or close to normal. Clouds will increase tonight
with lows in the mid to upper 30s.

Wet weather returns on Friday as the ridge exits and a quick-
moving front slides in. We`re in post-frontal onshore flow Friday
afternoon/evening with showers mainly in the Cascades. Snow
levels will lower to around 3,000 ft with snow expected at both
Stevens and Snoqualmie Passes. Snowfall totals may be enhanced in
the Central Cascades and passes with a Puget Sound Convergence
Zone - a Winter Weather Advisory is in effect.

A ridge builds offshore this weekend putting western WA under
northerly flow. A few weak disturbances will track down from B.C.,
keeping a chance of rain in the forecast. Total rainfall amounts
in the lowlands will be light, though. 33

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Long range models locking
onto a Rex Block pattern over the Pac NW moving through next
week. This pattern keeps western WA dry with precipitation being
deflected to our north. The low level air mass will be drier and
cooler with offshore winds. Morning lows will reach the upper 20s
to lower 30s. Expect highs in the 40s. The pattern looks to break
down late in the week with moist, zonal flow returning. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest flow aloft continues this afternoon as an
upper ridge axis shifts eastward, transitioning to west to
southwesterly tonight. This upper level flow will pick up speed as
an upper trough and associated frontal system approach the area late
tonight through Friday morning. Surface winds generally light and
variable around the Sound, while remaining terminals showing a
predilection for northeasterly to easterly direction with speeds
generally 5 kts or less. The exception being HQM, where speeds
generally running 8-12 kts. Winds will shift more south to
southeasterly late this afternoon, but little immediate impact to
speeds. As the aforementioned frontal system draws closer overnight
and early Friday morning speeds will increase to 8-12 kts.

Widespread VFR conditions in place although some isolated MVFR
conditions lingering along the Strait. Current satellite trend does
not show much in the way of this blob of low-level clouds eroding,
so CLM may be socked in for the day. Otherwise, VFR conditions will
persist for much of the TAF period before cigs lower down into MVFR
as rain associated with the front starts to move into the CWA. These
lower cigs will persist for the remainder of the TAF period.

KSEA...VFR conditions with high clouds this afternoon and evening.
Ceilings will lower back to MVFR by 15Z Friday as rain spreads into
the area. Surface winds light and variable in the early afternoon
before shifting southeasterly by 00Z. Winds will become more
southerly and pick up speed after 12Z Friday morning, generally
ranging 8-12 kts.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A warm front will brush the coastal waters this evening
and the trailing cold front will sweep onshore Friday morning. This
will bring an increase in winds area wide with many of the area
waters seeing speeds within SCA criteria. As such, will issue new
headlines for the Strait and adjacent waters with the afternoon
forecast package. Broad surface ridging will rebuild offshore for
increasing onshore flow Friday afternoon into Friday night. The
ridge will expand into area waters over the weekend for a relatively
quiet period into early next week before shifting into the interior
by the middle of next week for a period of offshore flow.

Coastal seas mostly 4-8 ft this evening, then ramping up to 12-16 ft
Friday morning as the front passes through. Seas will then straddle
the 10 foot threshold over the weekend before subsiding early in the
coming week.
