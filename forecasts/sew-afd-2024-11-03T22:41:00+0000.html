Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
241 PM PST Sun Nov 3 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An incoming storm system will bring widespread breezy
to locally windy conditions to the region. Winds will create
hazardous surf conditions along the Pacific Coast. Meanwhile,
heavy mountain snow may create difficult travel conditions above
3500 feet through Tuesday morning. Drier conditions are then
expected midweek before unsettled weather returns Friday and
beyond.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Generally quiet
conditions have been in place across much of the region today.
However, some persistent convergence banding has continued to
result in rain and high-elevation snow showers for most of the day
across portions of King and Snohomish counties. Little impact is
expected through the evening and overnight hours.

A rapidly deepening trough will swing through the region Monday
resulting in a myriad of weather impacts over the next 36 hours.

* Winds: Pre-frontal southerly winds will begin to increase along
  the coast before sunrise Monday and gradually increase and
  spread eastward through the morning hours. While most areas will
  see gusts 35-45 mph, some areas along the north coast as well as
  the north interior will see the stronger pre-frontal wind gusts
  on the order of 50-60 mph. Then in the wake of the front, a
  strong push of westerly winds will come through the Strait of
  Juan de Fuca, resulting in gusts 50-60 mph in the areas adjacent
  to the water (e.g. Port Angeles, Port Townsend, and Whidbey
  Island), and the potential for even stronger winds across the
  marine areas. Winds will gradually ease Monday night through
  Tuesday morning.

* Mountain Snow: Precipitation will spread across the region
  during the day Monday and snow levels will hover between
  3000-4000 feet for most of the day. Significant snow
  accumulations generally between 12-18 inches are expected above
  3500 feet for the central and northern Cascades, with lesser
  amounts further south. Widespread precipitation Monday will
  become more showery and tied to convergence banding Monday night
  into Tuesday morning. In addition, snow levels will fall to
  2500-3000 feet by Tuesday morning as precipitation winds down.
  This means that Stevens Pass is expected to receive far more
  accumulating snowfall that Snoqualmie Pass. Snoqualmie Pass may
  see a rain-snow mix during the day, but accumulations may not
  begin until late Monday night or Tuesday morning.

* High Surf: Large wind-driven waves of 18-22 feet are likely
  along the Pacific Coast Monday then tapering off Monday night.
  This will result in dangerous beach and jetty conditions along
  the coast. The good news is that tide levels should be low
  enough that coastal flooding is not expected to be an issue with
  this event.

Conditions are generally expected to improve Tuesday with
generally drier conditions Wednesday and Thursday as high
amplitude ridging moves over the area.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...As we move into late week and
the weekend, high pressure breaks down opening the door for the
next series of storm systems to move through the region. We will
see a return to low elevation rain and high elevation snow as well
as occasionally breezy-windy conditions. Overall, fairly typical
conditions for early to mid November in the Pacific Northwest.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow aloft turning westerly as broad
upper level troughing remains offshore. A few showers still out
there this afternoon but mostly a mix of VFR/MVFR conditions
across the area terminals. All conditions should improve to VFR
later this afternoon and evening, before lowering late tonight
into Monday morning ahead of a cold front. Expect a mix of
MVFR/IFR along the coast around 06z-09z before ceilings start to
lower in the interior around 13z-16z with rain that could limit
visibilities around 4sm-6sm. Southerly winds will also start to
increase first along the coast late tonight into tomorrow morning
15 to 20 knots, with gusts up to 25 to 30 kts. Winds across the
interior follow suit, with gusts likely up to 25 knots.

KSEA...Marginal MVFR still holding on this afternoon as high
clouds begin to stream in from an approaching front. VFR will
rebound by 00z and continue through most of the night. MVFR will
likely return by Monday morning (10z-15z) as rain moves through
the terminal. Southerly winds this evening 4 to 8 knots. Winds
will start to increase late tonight, (especially after 12z), with
winds around 15 to 20 knots with potential gusts up to 25 knots.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A robust low pressure system offshore will gradually
sink down and get closer to our coastal waters tonight and push a
cold front into our area. The Gale Watch that was posted for the
coastal waters has been upgraded to a Gale Warning for early
Monday morning, for increased southerly winds. As the front
passes by the afternoon, a strong push of westerlies down the
Strait of Juan De Fuca has prompted a Storm Force Warning, as
latest guidance agrees on frequent wind gusts up to 55 knots
through the Central and Eastern Entrance of the Strait through
Monday evening. A Gale Warning has also been posted for the
Northern Inland Waters, and Admiralty Inlet. Winds will start to
decrease by Tuesday morning.

High pressure will slowly build back over the offshore waters
Tuesday into Wednesday for calmer marine conditions.

Combined seas 16 to 19 feet this afternoon as a long period swell
generated by the aforementioned low pressure system gets closer to
our area. Seas will slightly decrease this evening before rising
rapidly again by Monday morning, with seas anywhere from 18 to 23
feet. The highest seas (21-23) will mainly be in the outer water
zones, with 18 to 20 foot seas focused in the inner water zones.
Seas will start to subside on Tuesday, although not completely
subsiding below 10 feet until Wednesday afternoon.
