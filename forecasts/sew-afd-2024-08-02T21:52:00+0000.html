Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
252 PM PDT Fri Aug 2 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure aloft will maintain elevated
temperatures and dry conditions through the weekend with a minimal
chance of thunderstorms over the Cascades. Increased onshore flow
and weak troughing will moderate temperatures on Tuesday before
weak flow aloft allows conditions to warm up once again.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Latest observations show
high pressure continuing to amplify northward into western
Washington alongside passing clouds in the southwest flow aloft.
Marine stratus remains firmly in place along the coast and inland
towards the Chehalis Valley, allowing temperatures in these areas
to moderate from yesterday. Further inland, temperatures will
continue to increase and peak well above normal in the upper 80s
to near 90 degrees across the Puget Sound lowlands. Onshore
surface flow is keeping conditions across the region moist, though
a smoke layer aloft has provided enough convective inhibition so
far today to limit the development of cumulus clouds. A weak
shortwave along the periphery of the high pressure ridge will
likely stir up more cumulus clouds later on in the afternoon,
especially over the Cascades, but conditions will likely remain
capped which will limit the potential for lightning. A rogue
lightning strike cannot be ruled out over the Cascades, but is
highly unlikely.

Monsoon moisture will continue to move northward from California
throughout the day today, paired with boundary layer winds
shifting westerly this evening. This will likely keep any shower
and thunderstorm activity to the east side of the Cascades
through the weekend, pacifying fire weather concerns for the
western Washington Cascades. An influx of cloud cover on Saturday
will limit temperatures a few degrees, reaching the mid 80s for
much of the lowlands and the upper 60s to lower 70s along the
coast. Weak troughing offshore will develop by Sunday, allowing
much of the inland cloud cover to shift eastward. While a marine
stratus layer will once again limit temperatures along the coast,
most inland lowlands will see highs rebound back into the upper
80s on Sunday. Monday remains a similar story as the weak cutoff
low stalls near Vancouver Island. Temperatures will remain
elevated, and monsoon moisture that advects into the region will
likely stay on the east side of the Cascades once again, though
there is still some uncertainty over the exact placement of any
precipitation that develops.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...A weak cold front Tuesday
will be enough to bring temperatures back to normal across western
Washington. The Cascades may see some shower and thunderstorm
development with the passing of the front, but once again
confidence is low. Ensemble guidance continues to favor above
normal temperatures through the rest of the forecast period, with
high pressure persisting over the desert southwest and weak flow
over western Washington. Any additional chances for isolated
thunderstorms over the Cascades cannot be ruled out for next week,
but models carry a low chance (5% to 10% probability).

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore low-level flow increases today with continued
southwest flow aloft. Low stratus has retreated to the coast but
will again return with a stronger push tonight. This will likely
bring some stratus to KPWT and KOLM and as far as around KSEA.
Meanwhile today, VFR conditions continue across the interior with
scattered high clouds and high level smoke/haze from regional fires.
Expect stratus to gradually clear from the interior Saturday morning
but linger through much of the day along the coast.

KSEA...VFR today with southwesterly surface winds to 10 kt through
evening. Winds ease a little overnight and a push of stratus likely
approaches the terminal after 11z with a few hours of IFR stratus
expected around daybreak.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will continue offshore through the early
part of next week. With lower pressure remaining over land, expect
to see predominantly northwesterly winds over the coastal waters
that become stronger each afternoon and evening. These persistent
winds will build seas closer to 6 feet (especially over the outer
coastal waters) and maintain choppy conditions. Meanwhile, a
stronger west push through the Strait of Juan de Fuca will bring
winds into the 20 to 25 kt range this afternoon and evening in the
central and eastern portions. Additional increases in wind are
likely through the Strait each evening Saturday through Monday, but
these are generally expected to remain short of needing an advisory.
A stronger push around Tuesday may bring the next chance of 25 kt
winds in the Strait.
