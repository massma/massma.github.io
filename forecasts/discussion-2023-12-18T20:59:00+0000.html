Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Strong low pressure lifts into southeast Canada tonight. High
pressure then slowly builds into the area on Tuesday, remaining
in control through the upcoming weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM TUESDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Strong low pressure with one center over southeast Canada
and another over southern New England will continue lifting to
the northeast this evening. Rain has quickly lifted north of the
area with dry conditions expected this evening.

Pressure rises behind the low will support a gusty W-WNW flow
into the evening. Sustained winds 15-20 mph with gusts 25-35
mph are likely. A few gusts up to 40 mph cannot be ruled out. No
additional headlines are anticipated. While there will continue
to be pressure rises through the night, they will not be as
steep as late this afternoon and evening. Wind gusts 25-30 mph
likely continue through about 03z near the coast, and then
weaken to about 15-20 mph thereafter. Gusts likely end across
the interior overnight.

The middle and upper levels dry out tonight, but there will be
some lingering lower level moisture. Cyclonic flow and the
lingering moisture supports some stratocu clouds overnight,
especially for the interior. Skies may become mostly cloudy
towards day break as the trailing upper low begins to move
overhead. Have left a slight chance PoP for western Orange
County as some light precip cannot be completely ruled out.
Moisture appears rather shallow so not enough confidence to go
higher than slight chance. The precip could be in the form of
flurries/light snow if any develops.

Lows tonight will be in the 30s, slightly above normal for this
time of year.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The upper low swings across the region on Tuesday. Any
flurries/light snow showers across Western Orange should dissipate
shortly after 12z. Will continue to carry a slight chance through 9
am. Otherwise, mostly cloudy skies are likely to start the day.
The trough axis shifts east in the afternoon which should allow
clouds to diminish in coverage. High pressure builds into the
region through the day. The pressure gradient between the high
to our west and departing low pressure well to our northeast
will keep breezy conditions in place. NW winds 10-15 mph with
gusts around 20 mph are possible. Highs will be near seasonable
levels in the lower to middle 40s.

The high remains just to our west Tuesday night. The departing
upper low likely begins to stall offshore to our southeast.
Heights overhead will rise with ridging returning. Winds will
likely not go completely calm, but should lighten considerable
at night. Skies will become mostly clear with dry conditions
leading to a chilly night. Temperatures will be in the 20s for
most locations except the NYC metro where lows will be near 30
degrees.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The large scale numerical weather prediction models in the
upper levels exhibit strong jet exiting farther northeast of
the region for midweek. No other strong southerly jet streaks
are forecast within the region thereafter through early next
week with dominant westerly component to the upper level flow.
This will allow for the airmass to remain mostly dry.

Mid week into the start of the weekend looks to have dominance
of surface high pressure judging from the consensus of large
scale numerical weather forecast model depictions of MSLP,
precipitation and winds. The Wednesday morning through Saturday
morning time period is expected to have a prevalence of dry
conditions.

Overall, near normal temperatures forecast generally looking at
extended guidance for Wednesday and Thursday, trending to colder
than normal Thursday night and Friday. Then, temperature trends in
the guidance climb closer to normal for Saturday and then above
normal for Sunday as well as Christmas Day.

For Saturday afternoon through rest of the weekend, despite
surface features amongst the large scale numerical weather
prediction models depicting high pressure nearby, in the mid
levels, ridging appears to break down. In the mid levels, there
is indication for some shortwave activity near the area with
associated positive vorticity advection. This could result in
some light precipitation for parts of the region. There is a lot
of uncertainty this far out in time so it is difficult to go
beyond 20 percent chance for precipitation. The precipitation by
some of the models does not appear to be significant so
Saturday afternoon through the rest of the weekend is forecast
to be mostly dry. Only have some slight chance of rain or snow
showers for parts of the region in the Saturday afternoon into
Saturday evening timeframe and this takes into account wet bulb
cooling.

For Christmas Day, more of a mid level ridging trend is indicated
in the 500mb height pattern forecasts amongst the large scale
numerical weather prediction models with surface high pressure
also depicted across the area. Dry conditions are forecast.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /21Z MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Strong low pressure tracks away from the region this evening
with high pressure building in tonight into Tuesday.

Low pressure is currently tracking quickly northeast into southern
New England. VFR conditions should have returned for the most part.
Any lingering MVFR conditions should quickly return to VFR by around
22Z, mainly for KGON. Thereafter, VFR conditions expected for the
rest of the TAF period. However ceilings on Tuesday may occasionally
go MVFR, with highest chances for KSWF and KHPN.

Sustained winds of 15 to 25 kt with gusts up to 35 kt are possible
over the next couple of hours, but should diminish through the
evening as the low continues to head away from the area.

     NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Amendments are possible, mainly for diminishing of wind gusts.

OUTLOOK FOR 18Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

Tuesday: Mainly VFR, brief MVFR cigs possible. WNW G20-25kt in the
afternoon.

Wednesday through Saturday: VFR.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Gale warnings remain on all waters into this evening. The
Gales should end on the NY Harbor, LI Bays, and most of the LI
Sound by 23z. The Gale Warning on the easternmost LI Sound zone
and ocean will go until 02z. Solid SCA conditions are then
expected through the rest of the night as winds gust 25-30 kt.
SCA gusts are likely Tuesday morning on the ocean. Otherwise,
winds on the waters should remain below SCA levels through
Tuesday night. Ocean seas will remain elevated through Tuesday
night necessitating the continuation of an SCA.

Looking at the marine long term forecast covering Wednesday
through Saturday night, expecting a continuance of SCA level
ocean seas Wednesday through Friday night with wind gusts also
meeting SCA thresholds for mainly Wednesday through Friday
timeframe. The forecast then shows a decline in these ocean seas
for Saturday, with an eventual return to below SCA seas that
will remain below SCA through Saturday night. For the non-ocean
waters, mainly below SCA conditions are forecast for the much of
the marine long term period but for Thursday into Thursday
night, parts of the non-ocean waters are forecast to have some
SCA level gusts.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Residual river flooding will then continue tonight and
potentially into early Tuesday. Afterwards, no hydrologic
impacts expected through next weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Widespread coastal flooding continues into early this evening.
Water levels have begun to recede below flood stage across the Lower
NY Harbor, and south shore back bays of Southern Queens. Elsewhere,
minor to moderate flooding impacts will continue. Locally major
flooding may occur, especially along the Great South Bay. High
tide has passed across the south shore, but it will take a few
hours for waters to recede below flood stage, taking longest
across the Great South Bay. Across the N shore of Long Island
and CT/Westchester coast, high tide occurs late this afternoon.
Have left the advisory in place for Manhattan as some minor
impacts are possible across the northeast portion of from
tidally influenced areas near the Harlem River.

Along the ocean beachfront, potential exists for 12-16 ft breakers
today (8-12ft for NYC beachfront), which combined with elevated
water levels, will likely result in widespread dune erosion and
scattered overwashes.

No additional coastal flooding is anticipated tonight through the
middle of the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
