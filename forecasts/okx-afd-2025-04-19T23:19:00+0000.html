Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
719 PM EDT Sat Apr 19 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
A cold front moves through tonight. High pressure builds in behind
it for Sunday into Monday. High pressure exits east on Monday.
A frontal system in southern Canada sends a warm front through
Monday night followed by a cold front late Tuesday. Thereafter,
weak high pressure remains in effect through Thursday. Another
frontal system is expected to impact us Friday into the weekend.

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SUNDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No major changes made with this evening update as the forecast
remains on track. Only temperatures through the evening and
early night were adjusted.

Key Messages:

* Isolated late day thunderstorms with strong wind gusts look
  less likely now, but could still see showers with the front
  late this evening, mainly N of NYC/NJ metro.

* Cold water submersion dangers for recreational boaters,
  canoers or kayakers this weekend with warm air temperatures,
  but water temps remaining in the 40s.

Upper level trough in southeastern Ontario moves into the Northeast
US tonight as an upper level high off the Southeast US coast remains
nearly stationary. Meanwhile, at the surface, a cold front moves
through early tonight. This cold front will be the focus for some
showers and thunderstorms this evening. Mesoscale models now
have a spotty line of showers moving through from 8 pm to 12
am, mainly across the Lower Hudson Valley, northeast NJ, and
inland southern CT (by the time it makes it to the coast, a more
stable air mass will allow for any showers to dissipate).

The front is expected to move through by the second half of tonight,
allowing temperatures to drop into the 50s prior to daybreak, and
bringing and end to any showers. However, this is still well above
normal for this time of year, with lows typically in the 40s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH MONDAY/...
Dry, but gusty day on Sunday thanks to cold air advection behind the
cold front. NW winds of 10 to 20 mph with gusts to 25 to 30 mph.
Although cooler conditions are expected, temperatures will still be
above normal for this time of year, in the 60s for much of the
forecast area, except 50s along the immediate coat and Twin
Forks of Long Island.

Upper level ridges approaches from the west Sunday night as the
center of high pressure moves overhead. This will be a good night
for radiational cooling. Undercut guidance by several degrees for
many outlying locations. Frost is possible for these areas, with
lows in the 30 for those areas. Lows in the 40s expected
elsewhere.

&&

.LONG TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...
A surface and upper low move into the Great Lakes Monday as
high pressure shifts offshore to our east. Dry weather mainly
expected on Monday, but increasing clouds late in the day.
Monday night the low over the Great Lakes shifts into southern
Ontario sending a warm front through our area then a cold front
later on Tuesday as the low shifts into Quebec.

Cloud cover is expected to increase Monday ahead of the warm front.
It should still be a cool day on Monday with highs in the low-60s to
upper-50s. A warmer Monday night is expected with the warm front
passage with lows Monday night in the upper-40s to mid-50s.
Temperatures climb further on Tuesday with highs in the mid/upper-
70s except for areas to the east cooler due to marine-influence.

Isolated to scattered showers are primarily expected Monday night,
clearing west to east into Tuesday.

Thereafter, dry weather is expected Tuesday night through Thursday
night with mostly sunny to partly cloudy skies under weak high
pressure.

The high moves east on Friday, with another shortwave/low pressure
system approaching for late Friday into the weekend. Mainly looking
at just chance POPs (30-35 percent) late Friday into the weekend for
now.
