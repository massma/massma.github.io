Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
300 PM PDT Fri Aug 23 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cool and unusually wet weather will linger into
Saturday followed by drier more seasonal weather Sunday. Another
shot of unsettled weather will brush the area Monday night into
Tuesday, followed by a return of drier warmer pattern with near
normal temperatures through the latter half of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A very moist air mass -
more like October than August remains in place over the region as
an unusually deep upper level low works slowly through the Pacific
Northwest. Have included a low-end chance of thunder over much of
the interior lowlands this evening, supported by NBM
probabilities and the presence of the upper level low and
embedded shortwaves rotating out of it. The best bet for isolated
thunder continues to be over the Cascades this afternoon into the
NBM where HREF 6 hour probabilities peak out in the 40-60% chance
range along the north Cascade crest. Otherwise, widespread light
rain and low clouds will be the norm this evening for most areas,
with afternoon temperatures remaining in the upper 50s.

The upper level low will weaken and meander eastward tonight with
easterly flow aloft. This will allow any evening thunderstorms
over the Cascades to slip west over the foothills before
weakening. Larger scale dynamics look to help keep more widespread
precipitation over the central and northern portion of the area
late tonight into Saturday morning. The NBM continues to show over
80% probabilities of 2 or more inches possible over the northern
Cascades through Saturday morning. Will have to keep an eye on
the Central and Northern Cascade burn scars especially with
possible higher short-period rain rates. Widespread, heavier
precipitation will weaken as the upper level trough move east
Saturday leaving scattered showers in it`s wake Saturday afternoon
- especially over the Cascades.

Increasing onshore flow behind the trough will also make for a
breezy day especially for areas adjacent to the Strait of Juan de
Fuca. Skies will remain cloudy with highs again well below normal
- in the lower to mid 60s. Conditions will trend drier Saturday
night with an upper level ridge building into the area. Low level
onshore flow will keep skies at least mostly cloudy into Sunday
morning, with some sunshine in the afternoon and highs in the mid
60s to lower 70s.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement with another progressive upper level trough moving into
Western Washington Monday night into Tuesday. Another round of
cooler, wetter weather. The grand ensemble continues to highlight
large scale ridging settling into the region midweek and possibly into
the following weekend. This would at least highlight a trend to
more normal temperatures through the later half of next week and
at least August typical sunshine.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level low off the coast of OR is pushing inland
today. Cigs will continue to remain low and visibilities oscillating
between 1-5SM at times of heavier rain. Reductions to less than 1
mile of visibility will be possible as the evening continues.
Surface winds will remain out of the WSW at 8-15 kt with breezier
conditions along the Strait of Juan de Fuca and northern Puget
Sound. Thunderstorms are possible along the Cascades throughout the
afternoon but widespread cloud cover will reduce the threat along
Puget Sound terminals. MVFR to IFR conditions will persist overnight
and into Saturday as rain continues.

KSEA...Cigs and vsbys at the terminal have been low over the past
several observations. IFR to LIFR cigs have been observed with vsbys
less than one mile at times. Rain is becoming more scattered in the
vicinity of the terminal which could lead to some improvements to
MVFR for the next several hours, but overnight, expect low end MVFR
to IFR conditions. Winds will be breezy out of the SSW at 10 to 15
kt into the late night period.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A low pressure system will gradually push inland on
Saturday. A weak frontal system then looks to move into the area
waters on Saturday, which will be followed by yet another system
pushing into the area waters on Monday. High pressure will then
gradually build back into the northeastern Pacific Tuesday and
persist through midweek.

Onshore flow will increase through the day, with westerly winds
picking up towards small craft criteria late this morning across the
central and eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca. Winds along the Strait
look to peak tonight into early Saturday. Latest guidance continues
to show southerly winds increasing across the interior waters
tonight as well, so have issued Small Craft Advisories for the Puget
Sound, Admiralty Inlet, and Northern Inland Waters for frequent
gusts to 25-30 kt, which are expected to persist through Saturday
morning.

Seas across the coastal waters will generally persist at 3-6 ft
through the weekend and into early next week.

. HYDROLOGY...Unusually wet conditions are expected through
Saturday morning especially over the the south slopes of the
Olympic Mountains and west slopes of the King, Snohomish, Skagit
and Whatcom County Cascade Mountains where NBM probabilities of
2 or more inches of precipitation is over 80%. These heavier, widespread
amounts will result in unusual rises and elevated flows on area
rivers and streams. The potential for shorter periods of even heavier
rain rates especially over the Cascades late this evening into
early Saturday will warrant monitoring particularly for new and
existing burn scar areas.

&&

.SEW WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...

PZ...Small Craft Advisory until 11 AM PDT Saturday for Central U.S.
     Waters Strait Of Juan De Fuca-East Entrance U.S. Waters
