Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
829 AM PDT Fri Oct 18 2024

.SYNOPSIS...An atmospheric river will bring moderate to heavy
rainfall and gusty winds to western Washington throughout the
weekend. High pressure will then build into the region early next
week, providing relief from the wet conditions for a few days.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The current trends remain on
track today with no planned updates. 33

Previous discussion...An atmospheric river pattern will develop
over the region today, bringing periods of heavy rainfall and
breezy winds throughout the weekend:

* HEAVY RAIN...An atmospheric river will bring significant
  rainfall over the weekend, causing sharp rises to area rivers
  and causing localized ponding of water on roadways. The heaviest
  rain will fall over the northern Olympic Peninsula and North
  Cascades. No rivers are currently forecast to flood over the
  weekend.

* GUSTY WINDS...The incoming atmospheric river will bring in gusty
  winds today into Saturday morning, reaching 30-45 mph along the
  north coast and across the northern Salish Sea. Wind gusts
  elsewhere will reach 20-30 mph.

Weak high pressure over western Washington will slowly erode this
morning as an atmospheric river pattern develops over western
Washington and British Columbia. Satellite imagery early this
morning already shows high concentrations of tropical moisture
being advected northward from the central Pacific. This moisture
will slowly pivot southward over the course of the weekend,
bringing significant rainfall to the region. While ensembles
continue to show the bulk of the incoming moisture centered over
Vancouver Island and British Columbia, significant rainfall is on
track for the Olympic Peninsula and North Cascades today through
Sunday night, where the heaviest rainfall totals could locally
reach 6 to 8 inches.

Rain will move inland along the Pacific coast this morning, with
an initial wave of rainfall filling in across western Washington
throughout the mid morning to mid afternoon. Forecast models
remain in good agreement over steady rainfall continuing over the
Olympic Peninsula, North Cascades, and northern lowlands through
Sunday morning while areas elsewhere will likely see rain
shadowing that will limit rainfall amounts. The storm system will
shift southward during the day Sunday, swinging a cold front
across the region that will bring another wave of moderate to
heavy rainfall for all areas. Ensembles have stayed consistent
with rainfall totals for this atmospheric river event, showing up
to 2 inches in the lowlands, 2 to 4 inches over the Cascades, and
locally higher amounts closer to 4 to 8 inches over the northern
coast, Olympics, and North Cascades. Despite significant rainfall
amounts, area rivers are not expected to reach action or flood
stage during this event, though local ponding on roadways is
likely to occur in areas receiving heavier rainfall.

This storm system will also bring in breezy conditions Friday into
Saturday morning, with gusts up to 30 to 45 mph over area waters,
the northern coast, and northern lowlands. Probabilistic guidance
even shows potential for gusts to reach 50 mph in areas including
Neah Bay, Whidbey Island, and Bellingham later this evening.
Areas elsewhere will see gusts reaching 20 to 30 mph as the
initial wave of rainfall moves inland today.

The deep moisture advection from the central Pacific will bring
in warmer temperatures, with highs over the weekend peaking in the
low to mid 60s across the lowlands. While this will keep snow
levels high, elevations above 5000 ft will see several inches of
snow accumulation over the course of the weekend.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Post-frontal showers will
continue into Monday as a positively tilted upper level trough
pushes the atmospheric river out of the region. At the same time,
a cutoff low will form offshore of California, developing split
flow aloft that will allow conditions to dry out by Tuesday. High
pressure will build into the region mid-week, allowing conditions
to dry out and skies to clear out. Temperatures will remain on the
cool side through the middle of next week, with highs in the mid
to upper 50s across the lowlands.

The next chance of rainfall enters the region late Thursday, with
ensemble guidance hinting at troughing developing over the Pacific
Northwest. This will bring a return to unsettled and cooler
conditions, though precipitation totals will be much lower than
this coming weekend.

.HYDROLOGY...The first atmospheric river of the fall season is on
track to bring periods of moderate to heavy rainfall to western
Washington over the weekend, which will cause sharp rises to area
rivers. Forecast models focus the heaviest rainfall over the
northern coast, Olympic Peninsula, and North Cascades, where
rainfall amounts could locally reach 4 to 8 inches. The remainder
of the Cascades will see up to 2 to 4 inches of rain, while the
lowlands are on track to see totals up to 2 inches over the course
of the weekend. Despite the significant incoming rainfall,
forecast models continue to keep river flows below action stage
and below minor flood thresholds throughout the weekend. However,
river forecast models often struggle with the first event of the
wet season in terms of balancing runoff and river flow losses
going overbank, so conditions will continue to be closely
monitored.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwesterly flow aloft becoming westerly this
afternoon as warm front moves into Southern British Columbia. The
front will stall tonight into Saturday.

VFR conditions this morning with broken mid-level stratus and high
clouds ahead of an incoming warm front. Rain is already coming in
along the coast. Initially the Puget Sound interior terminals will be
rain shadowed but light rain moving in this evening with MVFR
ceilings and local visibility 3-5sm in light rain. These conditions
will continue through Saturday morning.

KSEA...VFR conditions with broken mid and high level clouds this
morning. Ceilings lowering to MVFR 03z-06z after a brief period of
light rain this afternoon. The terminal will likely remain mostly in
the rain shadow. Ceilings remaining MVFR into Saturday morning.
Visibility could drop to 3-5sm after 06z tonight. Felton/LH<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A warm front moving into the northern portion of
the waters today will stall into Saturday. The warm front will
lift north Sunday as the trailing cold front moves through the
area. High pressure will rebuild over the coastal waters Monday
and over the inland waters Monday night.

Gale force winds are expected with the warm front over the
coastal waters as well as the entrances to the Strait of Juan de
Fuca, Admiralty Inlet, and the Northern Inland Waters late this
morning into early Saturday morning with small craft advisory winds
likely into Saturday afternoon. Small craft advisory winds Puget
Sound and Hood Canal this afternoon into early Saturday morning.

Seas around 10 feet through Saturday slowly subsiding Sunday into
the first part of next week. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
