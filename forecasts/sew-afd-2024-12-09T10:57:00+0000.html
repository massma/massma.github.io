Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
257 AM PST Mon Dec 9 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will build back into the region for the
first couple days of the workweek, with plentiful sunshine for
Monday afternoon after some morning stratus and patchy fog. Cloud
build back in for Tuesday however as the pattern returns to
unsettled Wednesday with multiple disturbances passing through to
the weekend<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Western Washington
currently sits in between a trough to the east (that produced the
weather this past weekend), and a ridge up the Pacific Coast to
Alaska. Above the region is the polar jet bringing in drier and
cooler air into the region from the north. Surface high pressure
sits underneath this ridge. This will weaken the gradients to
where there will be some areas of low stratus and fog this morning
until the sun is able to burn it off later in the day. The fog is
expected to be hit-or-miss and not widespread.

Monday will likely be the sunniest day of the week once the skies
clear out late this morning into the afternoon. Winds will be very
light under the high pressure and most of the cloud cover will
burn off (may linger longer in the South Interior. Temperatures
will peak in the mid 40s today, with lows around 30. High clouds
will build back in Monday night/Tuesday as the ridge begins to
move inland ahead of a trough. Tuesday is expected to remain
relatively dry, but a surface trough underneath the high pressure
to the south may be enough to produce a couple of light showers in
parts of the region (pop chances were too low to include in this
morning`s forecast update).

The real change back to unsettled weather will occur on Wednesday.
A weakening shortwave trough will approach the region with
increasing chances of precipitation later in the day across the
entire west part of the state. This trough (from Wednesday into
Thursday) is not expected to be an all day washout, as
precipitation amounts are expected to be very light (with several
hundredths for most areas and a few tenths in the Olympics/Pacific
Coast). Temperatures will warm up a few degrees (but still stay in
the 40s for highs and upper 30s for lows).

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...The previously mentioned
trough Wednesday will move through on Thursday with a weak surface
system. The amounts of QPF again appear pretty light through the
end of the day. The snow levels will be 3,500 feet in the
Cascades (4,500 feet for the Olympics), and this will also keep
snow accumulations light as well.

Ensembles/deterministic models show a more organized low moving
into the region from Friday into the weekend. It is too early to
tell how much precipitation could come frontal systems moving
through with this low feature, but agreement is pretty good that
we will see something move up our way towards the end of the week.
Please stay tuned for more details in future forecasts.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge over the area with the ridge axis
offshore giving the area north northwesterly flow aloft. Surface
high pressure remaining through at least Tuesday. Light surface
gradients combined with plenty of low level moisture will create
IFR or LIFR conditions especially Tuesday morning.

Real mixed bag of conditions this morning with everything from
LIFR to VFR. With the light northerly flow in the lower levels
these conditions will continue into the early afternoon hours
with the lower conditions, LIFR and IFR, dissipating by 20z.
Mostly clear skies overnight with visibility below a mile and
ceilings 200 feet or less developing over a majority of the area
09z-12z Tuesday. Conditions improving to VFR early Tuesday
afternoon.

KSEA...MVFR ceilings lowering to IFR 14z-16z. IFR ceilings
continuing into midday. Slow improvement in the afternoon with VFR
ceilings by 00z. LIFR ceilings and visibilities developing around
08z continuing into Tuesday morning. Light and variable wind
becoming light north northeasterly this afternoon through Tuesday
morning. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure over the waters through
Tuesday will weaken Wednesday. A front will reach the area late
Wednesday into Thursday. High pressure will briefly rebuild
Friday. Small craft advisory winds possible over the coastal
waters with the front.

Seas in the 10 to 12 foot range continuing this morning before
subsiding below 10 feet this afternoon. Seas building to 10 to 12
feet again behind front Thursday night. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Precipitation with the system in the middle of the
week will not be hydrologically significant. System over the
weekend wetter and could push the Skokomish River up to near
flood stage. Other rivers around the area rising but river
flooding is not expected at this time. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
