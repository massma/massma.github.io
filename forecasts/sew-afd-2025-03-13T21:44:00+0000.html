Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
244 PM PDT Thu Mar 13 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Lowland rain and mountain snow showers along with
isolated thunderstorms will continue throughout the afternoon and
evening. Additional systems Friday through Monday will bring off
and on rain, steady mountain snowfall, and occasionally breezy
conditions. A brief break is then expected through early Wednesday
before active weather returns late week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Scattered weak convective
showers continue to push ENE across western Washington this
afternoon. These showers are generally shallow limiting their
potential impact. The main concerns continue to be brief heavy
downpours, small hail, and isolated lightning. These showers will
continue into this evening then gradually taper off through Friday
morning. Snow levels overnight will fall to 1000-1500 feet which
could result in an occasional rain-snow mix on some of the higher
hills. However, no significant accumulation is expected.

A brief break is expected mid-day Friday before the next system
begins to slide into the region late Friday. This will usher in a
long duration light to moderate precipitation event that will
linger into Monday morning. The main concern is snow accumulations
in the mountains. Total snowfall over the weekend will be on the
order of 1-2 feet. However, that snowfall is spread fairly evenly
across the weekend, limiting the snowfall rates and impacts. This
means this will be primarily beneficial snowfall. If one were to
try to nail down a period of greatest concern it would be Friday
night into Saturday morning, potentially challenging those headed
across the mountain passes Saturday morning. It`s likely headlines
will be needed for this snowfall, but held off for the moment to
limit confusion with messaging for the ongoing system.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...Ridging is expected
to develop Monday night into Tuesday providing a break from the
precipitation. The break will be short-lived with additional
systems possible by Wednesday and beyond. This trend of relatively
cool and wet conditions is favored to continue late next week and
into the week 2 time frame.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mainly VFR to MVFR this afternoon as showers and
isolated thunderstorms stream inland. Pockets of MVFR to IFR reduced
ceilings/visibilities in heavier showers which may produce
graupel/small hail. Precipitation will slowly taper off overnight
with showers lingering mainly along the coast Friday. Surface winds
generally out of the south 5 to 15 kt with gusts to 25-30 kt this
afternoon easing after 03z tonight.

KSEA...VFR with brief MVFR conditions and graupel in stronger
showers and a low (10%) chance of lightning near the terminal this
afternoon. Showers will decrease this evening with continued VFR
ceilings and drier conditions into Friday. Surface winds generally S
to SW this afternoon with gusts to 25-30 kt easing after 03z.
Lighter south winds will continue overnight and shift to E after 15z
Friday morning.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Small Craft Advisory remains in effect for the coastal
waters with seas remaining elevated in the 8 to 11 foot range
through the evening. Another round of gusty southerly SCA winds
tonight into Friday afternoon over the outer waters, with seas
falling just below 10 feet.

Seas and winds will elevate once again heading into the weekend,
with seas rising between 10 and 13 feet on Saturday and Sunday and
additional rounds of gusty winds over both outer and inland waters.
The chance for gale force winds over the outer waters this weekend
is moderate (40% chance), but confidence is not high enough to issue
a Gale Watch at this time. Seas are favored to remain above 10 feet
through the early part of next week.

weekend will result in rises on the Skokomish River. Current
projections bring the Skokomish River into Minor flood stage
Sunday. A hydrologic outlook remains in effect through Monday
morning. While other rivers will experience rising water levels,
river flooding is not expected elsewhere over the next 7 days.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
