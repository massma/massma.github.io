Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
349 PM PST Fri Nov 15 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Isolated showers and cloudy skies will persist today,
providing a brief break in impactful weather. A strong storm
system will enter the region on Saturday, bringing in widespread
precipitation and breezy winds through Monday. Unsettled
conditions are favored to continue into Tuesday and Wednesday,
with potential for cool and wet conditions through the end of next
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Moist northerly flow will
continue to promote light shower activity over the mountains this
afternoon and evening as an upper level trough axis shifts
eastward of the Cascades. Below normal temperatures will persist
today with highs reaching the upper 40s for most of the lowlands.
Satellite imagery shows cloud cover increasing from the west as
the next system approaches, and cloud cover will continue to
increase throughout the overnight period ahead of incoming
precipitation.

Another strong storm system will push into the Pacific Northwest
on Saturday, bringing in more widespread precipitation and breezy
winds through Monday. The primary impacts of this storm system
are outlined below:

* MOUNTAIN SNOW: A storm system will bring in significant
  mountain snowfall over the weekend, with potential for 1 to 2
  feet of snow above 2000 ft through Monday. The heaviest snow
  will fall on Sunday into Monday, making travel through the
  Cascade Passes difficult.

* COASTAL FLOODING: Coastal flooding will continue during high
  tide periods along the Pacific Coast through the weekend, with
  increasing potential for coastal flooding through interior
  waters this weekend.

* RIVER FLOODING: The incoming precipitation will cause rises to
  area rivers, and the Skokomish River is on track to enter Minor
  Flood Stage by early Sunday. Other area rivers continue to be
  monitored.

Precipitation will start to spread inland early Saturday, with
snow levels hovering near 2000-3000 ft. Snowfall over the Cascades
will quickly rise above 6000 ft as a warm front lifts across
western Washington throughout the day Saturday. Snowfall across
the Cascade passes will quickly change over to rain, producing
hazardous travel conditions with slushy road surfaces. Steady
precipitation will continue across the region ahead of an incoming
cold front that will cross western Washington mid-day Sunday and
lower snow levels back down to 2000 ft by Monday morning.
Precipitation over the mountains will transition back to snow,
with heavy totals expected through the passes. The heaviest snow
will fall on Sunday over the North Cascades, where Washington Pass
will see accumulations of 18 to 24 inches. Snow totals through
the passes will decrease moving southward, with totals between 12
and 16 inches through Stevens pass and up to 12 inches through
Snoqualmie Pass through Monday. With high confidence, the entire
western Cascade range has been upgraded to a Winter Storm Warning
above 2000 feet. The lowlands will also see significant
precipitation with this storm system, with totals reaching 1 to
1.5 inches between Saturday and Monday.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Ensembles and operational
forecast models have come into better agreement over unsettled
conditions continuing through at least mid-week, with signals for
an anomalously strong low pressure system rapidly developing
southwest of Vancouver Island midday Tuesday into Wednesday.
Depending on the exact track and intensity of this low, coastal
areas could see significant wind and waves as this system evolves.
With a large pressure gradient setting up from the Pacific to
eastern Washington, the chance for strong gap winds through the
Cascades exists at this time. Alongside potential coastal
hazards, the Cascade range will experience another round of snow
before warm air bumps snow levels above the major passes. For the
lowlands, this means a rainy regime for multiple days in a row
once again. Beyond this, early signals for late next week indicate
much uncertainty, with the best guess at this point being a wet
pattern with continued chances for precipitation existing on each
day through the end of the forecast period.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northerly flow aloft this evening, turning more
northwesterly on Saturday as ridging aloft persists, for now. We`re
mostly VFR across western WA as lingering fog over the SW interior
has all but burned off. For tonight, increasing high clouds should
keep low cigs at bay as VFR conditions prevail for most TAF sites.
Can`t rule out terminals such as KOLM fogging up before high clouds
set in. Rainfall looks to increase across the area tomorrow as
MVFR/IFR conditions return around late-morning towards the
afternoon. Lighter surface winds tonight will increase out of the
S/SE on Saturday, becoming gusty at times.


KSEA...VFR currently and should trend throughout the remainder of
the night. Surface winds light northwesterly this afternoon before
backing to southerly later tonight. VFR into Saturday morning but
rainfall will increase allowing MVFR conditions to return Saturday
afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface ridging over the area as SCA for coastal
waters for waves expire. But, ridging will shift inland later
tonight as a warm front enters Saturday afternoon followed by a cold
front late Saturday night into Sunday morning. Previous Gale Watches
have been upgraded to warnings over the coastal waters and East
Entrance of the Strait. An additional Gale Warning has been issued
for Admiralty inland as these areas are slated to see strong
southerly winds Saturday/Saturday evening. Small craft advisories
have been issued for the remainder of the waters for the period
Saturday through early Sunday. Brief surface ridging builds over the
waters later Monday into Monday night. Models are beginning to show
the possibility of a very stout sub-950 millibar surface low bombing
over the offshore waters Tuesday/Tuesday night. Confidence in the
track and strength of this system is low at this stage, but it is
likely, at a minimum, to generate some pretty large seas (20+ feet)
in addition to other hazards such as very strong winds, possibly
near Storm Force strength over the coastal waters.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Rivers are settling down now and will continue to
recede for the next 24 to 30 hours.

Another system will move into the region Saturday into early Monday,
bringing more widespread precipitation to the area. Lowlands could
see up to an inch and mountains 2 to 6 inches of precipitation as
the models have slightly increased the QPF. Snow levels will
fluctuate quite rapidly, with snow levels rising up to 5000-7000 ft
Saturday then back down to 2000-4000 ft on Sunday. Expect rises on
area rivers, with the largest rises again expected on the rivers
flowing off of the Olympics and the north and central Cascades.
Currently, with the precipitation is spread out over more than two
days, no river flooding is expected outside of the Skokomish
river, which may return to minor flood stage by Sunday. Flooding
potential will depend on temperatures, QPF, and snow levels during
the heaviest precipitation and will continue to be monitored over
the next few days. The weather pattern looks like it will
continue to bring periods of precipitation through next week.
