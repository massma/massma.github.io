Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
918 AM PDT Sun Sep 1 2024

.SYNOPSIS...An upper level ridge will maintain warm and dry
conditions today. An incoming shortwave trough will bring a
return to onshore flow and cooler temperatures on Monday, as well
as a few showers or isolated thunderstorms over the Cascades.
A ridge will rebuild over the area midweek for a return to dry and
warmer conditions.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Marine stratus has pushed in
all the way to Olympia and Tacoma Narrows Airport as of 8 AM this
morning. The stratus appears to be very shallow and close to the
ground, with locally limited visibility in patchy fog. Stratus
will gradually burn off through the morning. High temperatures
across the interior a smidge cooler than yesterday while coastal
areas will be 15 to 20 degrees cooler. The marine layer will
deepen substantially on Monday with a mostly cloudy and
considerably cooler day expected for most of the Western
Washington lowlands. Increasing southerly flow aloft along with
some elevated instability will lead to a slight chance of
thunderstorms over the southern Cascades by early Monday and the
threat will spread north along the spine of the Cascades into
Monday afternoon. Onshore flow and cool conditions will continue
into Tuesday, but upper ridging will begin to rebuild just
offshore as signs point toward a noteworthy warming trend heading
into the beginning of the long term forecast period. 27/LH

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Just in time for
students heading back to school, an upper ridge axis will
strengthen over the region and the low level flow will turn
offshore once again. Coastal as well as interior lowland areas
will warm back into the upper 70s to mid 80s Wednesday into
Thursday under plenty of sunshine. The ridge weakens somewhat and
the flow turns onshore heading into the end of week. This will
cool temperatures a bit, but ensembles are in relatively good
agreement that dry conditions and above normal temperatures will
remain in place into Saturday. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Western Washington will remain on the back side of an
upper level ridge today. An upper level low off the southern
Oregon coast today will move inland on Monday. Southerly flow
aloft will persist into Monday. Increasing onshore flow expected in
the lower levels with a thermally induced trough moving east of
the Cascades.

Stratus persists along the coast this morning and has pushed
inland into portions of the southern Sound, mainly impacting KOLM.
Ceilings in the stratus are below 500 feet. Expect stratus along
the southern Sound to retreat back towards the coast through the
morning hours. Stratus looks to stay along the coast through the
day and will move back inland tonight reaching the Puget Sound
area likely between 09Z-12Z with IFR ceilings.

KSEA...Clear skies. Light wind becoming northwest 4 to 8 knots
around 18Z. Wind switching to southwest around 06Z with IFR
ceilings arriving 09z-12z. Felton/14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...Increasing onshore flow today as thermally induced
surface trough moves into Eastern Washington. Onshore flow
pattern continuing into Tuesday. Another thermally induced trough
moving northward along the coast Wednesday with offshore flow
Wednesday and Thursday.

Small craft advisory westerly winds in the Central and Eastern
Strait of Juan de Fuca tonight and again Monday night. Felton

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge will continue to promote warm
and dry conditions today. The low levels of the atmosphere remain
quite dry in the Cascades and Cascade valleys and relative
humidity values could drop as low as 15-20 percent in the central
and southern portions of the Washington Cascades and mountain
valleys this afternoon. Conditions are unstable with mid-level
Haines reaching 6. Fuels in zone 659 have dried to where ERCs now
exceed the 90th percentile. A Red Flag Warning remains in effect
for the central Cascades from early this morning through this
afternoon. Moist and cool onshore flow will begin to develop this
evening, providing relief to the critical fire weather conditions.

With fuels continuing to dry region-wide, we will have to watch
the potential for some isolated thunderstorms over the Cascades on
Monday. While storms are not expected to be widespread enough for
Red Flag conditions, little precipitation is expected and there
is some potential for new fire starts.
