Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
824 PM EDT Fri Jun 14 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
A cold front will move through the area this evening with high
pressure building in from the northwest behind it. High pressure
becomes centered over the area Sunday morning and moves offshore by
Sunday evening. The high remains in control through late next
week.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SATURDAY MORNING/...
The line of severe/marginally severe thunderstorms moved east
of the watch area, and the watch has been cancelled. The line
was moving into a more stable airmass, and the storms continues
to slowly diminish.

A cold front will be pushing through the forecast area into
this evening, shifting east of us overnight.

An isolated stronger storm remains possible early this evening,
until the line pushes farther to the east into more stable air.
Also with tall/skinny CAPE will be present with PWATs expected
to to climb up to around 1.6 inches and heavy rainfall remains
possible, with a local flood threat, and a few flood advisories
remain in effect.

Rain threat should be done by daybreak, with low temperatures
mostly in the 60s.

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM SATURDAY MORNING THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT/...
High pressure builds in for the weekend with dry and less muggy
conditions as dewpoints fall to around 50. Both days look to feature
mostly sunny conditions, with some cumulus development on Saturday
and perhaps some cirrus streaming by on Sunday. Highs mostly around
80 on Saturday, with slightly cooler conditions on Sunday for
coastal areas as winds shift onshore.

&&

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
The key point for the long term is that there is increasing
confidence in a prolonged heat wave in the middle to late next week
with heat indices approaching or exceeding 100F at times Tuesday
through Friday.

Ongoing deep-layered ridging on Monday continues into at least
Wednesday. Models show slight flattening of the ridge aloft with
maybe a weak surface trough setting up for both Thursday and Friday.
Will continue to advertise dry weather through at least Thursday
given the subsidence/capping working against whatever CAPE may
manage to build up to. Slight chance/chance PoPs for Friday as per
NBM. Still too early to have any confidence in any over-the-ridge
convection spilling over into the forecast area for any of the days
in the long term.

Based on global deterministic and ensemble guidance, best guess for
850mb temps for Monday are 16-17C, approaching 20C on Tuesday, then
20-21C Wednesday through Friday. After high temperatures of mostly
85-90 on Monday, highs mostly in the middle and upper 90s are
expected away from the coast Tuesday through Friday. Although it`s
too soon to have high confidence in detailed heat indices during
this period, at least advisory criteria would likely be met for a
good portion of the forecast area starting on Tuesday given the
current forecast. So far, models aren`t indicating a very dry
boundary layer each afternoon or west to NW surface winds, so these
two factors would limit daytime mixing out of surface dewpoints.

Given the potential duration of the heat, it`ll be important to take
precautions to protect one`s health, particularly those without
effective cooling and/or adequate hydration. Some heat-sensitive
industries and infrastructure will likely be impacted by the extent
of this heat as well.

.AVIATION /00Z SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The main band of showers and thunderstorms has worked east of
the NYC and Lower Hudson Valley terminals. The area will continue
to weaken and diminish in coverage while working across the
eastern terminals the next couple of hours. A band of light
showers will follow, but should be brief. Actual cold front
works from west to east across the area from around 04Z at KSWF
to 09Z at KGON.

Mainly a VFR forecast outside of any heavier showers. Winds will
go light and variable. There is small chance that some patchy
fog and a brief IFR/LIFR ceiling develops before northerly
winds increase behind the cold front. There is also a chance
for a few gusts 15-20kt behind the cold front, but that is more
likely after 12Z Saturday. Gusts diminish in the later afternoon
Saturday as high pressure works in from the Great Lakes.

  ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

A brief shower is possible the first half of the night. Northerly
wind gusts could develop sooner than forecast behind the cold
front overnight, but should not be frequent until late morning.

OUTLOOK FOR 00Z SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...

Saturday Night through Wednesday: VFR.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A southerly flow will occasionally gust up to 25kt ahead of an
approaching cold fronts, otherwise, sub- advisory conditions
outside of any thunderstorms, which may be strong to severe.

For the weekend through Monday, sub-advisory conditions prevail.
There may be a chance of a few S-SW gusts to 25kt and seas
approaching 5 ft each afternoon/early evening for Mon-Wed on the
ocean west of Fire Island inlet. SCAs probably won`t be needed for
each day.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...
The heaviest rains have moved into portions of southwestern
Connecticut and into Nassau county. A few flood advisories
remain across Rockland county, Southern Westchester county,
and into Southern Fairfield county where up to 2 to 2 1/2 inches
of rain has fallen. With the storms weakening farther to the
east the heavy rainfall threat will be diminishing.

Average storm total rainfall amounts will be between half an
inch and 1.50 inches, with pockets of 2-plus inches possible.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
There is a high risk for rip current development along Atlantic
facing beaches today with southerly flow 15 to 20 kt along the
shoreline and surf up to 4 ft expected.

Conditions begin to improve by Saturday, with a moderate risk
forecast as winds shift offshore.

&&

.OKX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CT...None.
NY...High Risk for Rip Currents until 9 PM EDT this evening for NYZ075-
     080-081-178-179.
NJ...None.
MARINE...None.
