Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
913 AM PST Sat Dec 14 2024

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Some updates were made to the wind forecast this morning
to account for stronger conditions throughout Puget Sound,
including changes to wind headlines. Additionally, some changes
were made to the marine forecast as the Grays Harbor Bar report
came in with 21 foot waves. That will be discussed in the marine
section below.

.SYNOPSIS...A strong frontal system moving into Western Washington
today will produce gusty winds, lowland rain, mountain snow, and
high surf conditions. Coastal flooding is expected to impact the
shorelines throughout the weekend. A series of additional frontal
systems will cross the area into the middle of next week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong low pressure system
is making its way into Vancouver Island this morning, accounting
for the windy and rainy conditions in western Washington. Note the
changes that were made in the update section previously, but the
rest of the previous discussion captures the hazards well and can
be found below.

Winter Weather: To start, a Winter Storm Warning has been
upgraded from a previous advisory for the North Cascades at
elevations 3500 ft or greater. Snow totals up to 1 to 2 ft are
expected through Sunday morning. Winter Weather Advisories remain
for the Central/Southern Cascade zones for areas 3500 ft or
greater through Sunday morning with up to 8 to 12 inches. SSW
winds along the face of Mt. Baker has lead to impressive totals so
far with 14" observed since Friday afternoon with more expected
through tonight.

Wind: The aforementioned surface low has deepened considerably allowing
a decent offshore gradient to set up from Quillayute to
Bellingham. As a response, strong winds are expected as a High
Wind warning remains for the North Coast with gusts upwards of 55
to potentially 60 mph. HREF guidance indicates a 80% chance of
gusts greater than 55 mph through midday today for locations such
as Neah Bay, La Push, etc. A Wind Advisory also continues for the
Central Coast, San Juan Islands, and Inland locations such as W
Whatcom, W Skagit, and Admiralty Inlet to name a few. Any
lingering wind related headlines should be allowed to expire this
afternoon. Breezy conditions are expected throughout Puget Sound
and a wind advisory has been issued there as well.

High Surf & Coastal flooding: Big waves have been generated by
this disturbance as seas as high as 20 ft have been observed
offshore near Buoy 46041. Large breaking waves up to 20 ft are
expected in the surf zone. Storm surge along with the current
high tide cycle will lead to the possibility of 2.00 to 3.50 ft of
water above ground level for shorelines and low-lying areas along
the Pacific and Strait of Juan de Fuca Coasts and San Juan`s
through this afternoon where a Coastal Flood Warning has been
issued. A Coastal Flood Advisory continues for both W Whatcom and
W Skagit counties through this afternoon as well with inundation
up to 2 ft possible for shorelines.

Showers are to remain in the forecast for Sunday as we`ll see
somewhat of a brief reprieve. Upper-ridging will track overhead
as guidance has us in between systems. However, late Sunday night
into Monday the next frontal disturbance is line to arrive with
another shot of widespread precipitation. High temperatures
throughout the short-term forecast will remain in the 40s with
overnight lows in the 30s and 40s.


.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Confidence in the pattern
going into next week is rather low. Generally, the ensembles are
trying to signal an upper-ridge over the Intermountain West by the
midweek. This places western Washington on the periphery of the
mentioned ridge, leaving us susceptible to a potential atmospheric
river. The 12Z ECMWF ensembles have zoned in on this, but other
model ensembles are not in favor. Additional disturbance are
likely through the remainder of the week but again, confidence is
not particularly high at this time.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Strong southwesterly flow aloft continues today as deep
upper trough and associated frontal system sweeps onshore over
Western Washington. Very gusty S/SE surface winds will continue into
early afternoon before gradually easing by this evening.
Ceilings will be a mixed bag of VFR and MVFR in passing
showers through afternoon. As surface winds ease and shower activity
diminishes tonight, ceilings are expected to deteriorate to mostly
MVFR by 09Z-12Z.

KSEA...Ceilings expected to remain generally VFR today though
occasionally lowering to high end MVFR in passing showers.
Ceilings are expected to deteriorate to MVFR tonight into midday
Sunday. Winds will be the main story today. Surface winds southerly
15 to 25 knots through 00Z with occasional gusts to around 35 knots
through early afternoon. Winds easing to southerly 8 to 12 knots
this evening.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>


&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong surface low near 982 millibars is making
landfall over central Vancouver Island this morning. An associated
back bent occlusion will continue to produce very gusty winds across
area waters through this afternoon before the surface low weakens
over southern British Columbia later today. Gales continue all
waters with coastal seas over 20 feet. Winds will begin to relax
tonight and seas will gradually subside, but it will be late Sunday
morning at the earliest before coastal seas drop back below 10 feet.
Weak surface ridging briefly rebuilds over the waters late tonight
and early Sunday before another frontal system approaches the
offshore waters. This front will be weaker, but is likely to
generate small craft advisory conditions for the coastal waters and
portions of the inland waters Sunday night into Monday. A series of
additional systems are likely to follow throughout much of next week
for continued unsettled conditions and seas remaining hazardous over
the coastal waters more often than not.   27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Latest guidance still has been uncertain regarding
rainfall amounts in the Olympics, with overall totals being a
touch higher than previous forecasts. Area rivers will still rise,
with only the Skokomish River being expected to reach near action
stage. Even with the slightly higher QPF amounts, the Skokomish
River still is forecasted to barely reach action stage today. This
will continued to be monitored as more guidance becomes
available. Additional rounds of precipitation could keep the
Skokomish river at or near flood stage into early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
