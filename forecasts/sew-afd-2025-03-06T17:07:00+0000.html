Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
907 AM PST Thu Mar 6 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Relatively dry conditions are expected across much of
western Washington through this weekend. The exception will be
across far northwestern Washington as a system glaces the area. A
cool and wet weather pattern may return early next week bringing
lowland rain, snow, and increased winds back to the mountains.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Dry, northerly, flow has
set up over WA today with an amplified ridge aloft centered
offshore (near 130W). Near the surface, weak convergence has
caused a low-level stratus deck to form around Puget Sound. This
cloud cover will be short lived, however, as the UW WRF shows
nearly completely clear skies by 21z. Expect plenty of sun this
afternoon with highs in the low to mid 50s. Knauss

The ridge shifts inland Friday and Saturday for more dry and mild
weather. The air mass will be a little warmer with highs on
Saturday reaching the upper 50s to lower 60s. Morning lows will
still be chilly and in the 30s. 33

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...The ridge flattens a bit
by Sunday and shifts a little east and farther inland. This now
brings rain to the coast, Olympic peninsula and North Interior as
a weak front tries to shift in. Rain increases toward the evening
for Seattle south as the front slowly pushes farther in. Snow
levels hover around 4,000 ft then drop to around 2,500-3,000 late
Sunday night. The north Cascades may see heavy snow during this
period with around 1-3" at the passes.

We`re under moist onshore flow on Monday with additional showers
and mountain snow. More wet weather is headed our way by Tuesday
with a passing short wave trough. A stronger system approaches the
region toward midweek bringing the potential for windier weather.

northerly by the afternoon. Patchy fog (LIFR) and MVFR/IFR
stratus is developing east of Puget Sound and along river valleys.
Stratus will improve to VFR by 18-19z today. North winds will
increase this afternoon before transitioning southerly Thursday
night. Another round of low clouds and patchy fog is again
possible into early Friday morning.

KSEA...MVFR conditions this morning with some low clouds/stratus.
Cigs will likely improve by 18-19z with VFR expected for the

.MARINE...A SCA remains in effect for high seas through Thursday
evening for the outer coastal waters. Otherwise, high pressure will
maintain calmer marine conditions through Friday. Then, a frontal
system will move over the waters late Friday night into the weekend,
bringing small craft winds to the coastal waters, Strait of Juan de
Fuca, and Northern Interior waters. Seas 8 to 10 ft today,
decreasing to 6 to 8 ft tonight through Friday. Seas will build to
10-14 ft Friday night through the weekend as an active weather
pattern is favored into next week.
