Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
356 PM EDT Sun Jun 22 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
High pressure continues to build into and south of the region
Monday and Tuesday. A frontal boundary becomes nearly stationary
across the region late Tuesday night through the upcoming
weekend as multiple waves of low pressure move along the
boundary.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM MONDAY MORNING/...
Upper level ridge and surface high pressure build into the region
tonight. Skies will continue to clear out with temperatures
overnight remaining rather mild. Expect lows to only fall into the
70s. Temperatures in the NYC/NJ metro area may only remain in the
upper 70s to near 80.

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM MONDAY MORNING THROUGH TUESDAY/...
* Extreme Heat headlines continue for a majority of the forecast
  area.

* The extreme Heat Watch has been converted to Heat Advisories

* Monday and Tuesday will be the hottest days of the week.

The heat really kicks up on Monday gets going on Monday with
high temperatures expected to be in the 90s for most of the
forecast area. The only exception may be right along the
immediate coastline. Temperatures will reach the upper 90s for
NE NJ and the Lower Hudson Valley, and can not rule out a few
100 readings. Heat Index values will peak in the 105-110 range
inland and 95-105 along the coast.

Lows Monday night will not offer much relief as low temperatures
will only be in the 70s with more urban locations possibly not
dropping below 80.

Right now, temperatures are expected to be slightly higher on
Tuesday as compared to Monday, though dew points may be slightly
lower so heat index values will be comparable. High temperatures for
much of the area Tuesday may approach 100 or rise into the low 100s
away from the coast. Given a westerly flow, coastal areas like Long
Island may rise into the middle to upper 90s as well. This will
likely be the hottest day for the coastal areas.

Given the expected excessive heat, an Extreme Heat Warning is in
effect through Tuesday. The highest heat index values will occur
each afternoon, but especially on Monday and Tuesday. Heat
Advisories are in effect for portions of Long Island and coastal
Middlesex and New London County in CT.

&&

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...
* Wednesday will likely be the the last day of heat/humidity for
  this week.

* A more unsettled weather pattern likely develops Wednesday through
  the upcoming weekend.

The upper ridge begins to weaken and flatten Tuesday night with
heights falling into Wednesday. Continental zonal flow then remains
across the northern tier of the country Wednesday night into the
upcoming weekend as a series of weak shortwaves move through the
flow. At the surface a backdoor cold front drops into the region
Tuesday night into Wednesday, and then with the near zonal flow the
front becomes nearly stationary across the region. The last day of
the current heat and humidity will be Wednesday as air temperatures
rise into the lower and mid 90s, and heat indices peak at around 95
to 100 across much of the region. There is the potential for a final
day of heat headlines. However, with the chance of precipitation
Wednesday heat advisory criteria may not be reached. Unsettled
weather is possible Wednesday afternoon into the upcoming weekend,
with temperatures falling back to near normal Thursday through
Sunday. Followed the deterministic NBM guidance for all
parameters.

&&

.AVIATION /19Z SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
High pressure will remain mostly in control. Southwesterly
winds around 10-15kt with gusts up to 20-25kt this afternoon,
with highest gust expected around the NYC terminals will
diminish tonight.

around 5-10kts becoming south around 10kt Monday afternoon.

cancelled the small craft advisory for the remainder of the
afternoon/evening. Sub-SCA conditions are expected through the
middle of the week as high pressure settles over and south of
the area.

night through Friday night across all of the forecast waters.
