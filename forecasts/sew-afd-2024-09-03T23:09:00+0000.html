Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A strong upper level ridge will build over the
northwest by midweek. Temperatures will increase well above
average for all areas Wednesday through Friday, with Thursday
being the warmest day with widespread moderate heat risk. The
ridge will depart eastward by the weekend, dropping temperatures
into the weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Cloud cover this afternoon
continues to stick around much of western Washington as an upper
level low slowly departs the region to the east. Some clearing has
taken place (primarily over the Olympics and Cascades), and more
clouds in the Southwest Interior/South Puget Sound continue to
scatter out this afternoon. As a result of the cloud cover, high
temperatures will only top out in the upper 60s to low/mid 70s
this afternoon (warmest temperatures in the Olympia-Tacoma
corridor).

By Wednesday, the upper level trough will depart and dig over
Idaho/Montana. Washington state will see troughing replaced by
strong upper level ridging as a strong bubble of high pressure
forms over the East Pacific, and begins to advance into the region
through the second half of the work week. The jet flow pattern
weakens quite a bit overhead, as thermal troughing sets up over
the coast below the ridge. This will help aid in seasonally above
average temperatures (for this time in September) in western
Washington. The temperatures for Wednesday will be significantly
warmer than Tuesday (with significantly clearer skies) - upper 70s
to low and mid 80s (with the warmest temper

A heat advisory was issued for a majority of western Washington
Thursday and Friday for the warmer temperatures. Heat risk during
this period will be widespread moderate (orange) and isolated
areas of major (red) heat risk in the valley areas (Cascades and
Olympics). The warmest day will on Thursday, with high
temperatures ranging from the upper 80s (coastal areas and higher
elevations) to low and mid 90s (urban areas, Southwest Interior,
and valley areas). There is low confidence in elevated smoke from
wildfires in Oregon making it into Washington. The flow pattern
aloft is weak, but if some elevated smoke makes it into the
region, it may bring prevent sunlight from making it to the
surface, and bring temperatures down a couple degrees. There will
still be HeatRisk impacts either way with this synoptic pattern
moving into Western Washington, and persons under the advisory
should stay hydrated (if outdoors).

The heat continues into Friday with highs just a few degrees
cooler than Thursday. The heat risk will still remain moderate
(with pockets of major heat risk in valley areas). Low
temperatures will range in the upper 50s to low 60s overnight for
all areas. It will be important to stay cool overnight (especially
when sleeping). Winds will also be very light during this event
(light north to northeasterlies), so it is also important to cool
off using fans (especially people without air conditioning).

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The upper level ridge/high
pressure system will move east Friday into Saturday. High
temperatures will drop substantially on Saturday with highs in the
upper 70s to low/mid 80s. A trough over the Pacific will bring
southerly to southwesterly flow into the region early next week.
Cloud coverage will increase, and there is a slight chance of rain
showers along the coast Sunday, and spreading to the entire
coverage area by Tuesday. High temperatures will drop into the 70s
during this period.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northerly flow will transition more northeasterly on
Wednesday with an upper ridge building over the area. A mix of
VFR/MVFR cigs this afternoon as stratus continues to slowly
dissipate across Western Washington. Stratus will continue along the
coast through this evening. LIFR/IFR stratus will slowly move inland
again tonight into the Southwest Interior as well as Strait of Juan
de Fuca. Areas of LIFR/IFR cigs will also be possible in southern
and central Puget Sound, but expected to be more limited. Any
stratus will clear by Wednesday afternoon for SKC. N/NW winds into
this afternoon will become lighter tonight before increasing
Wednesday.

KSEA...Lingering mid level cigs this afternoon will slowly clear
further into this evening. Confidence is lower in stratus for
Wednesday morning, with approximately a 15% of IFR cigs between 13-
17z. Otherwise, SKC expected Wednesday afternoon. NW winds ranging 5
to 8 kt this afternoon will become NE tonight before increasing N/NW
Wednesday afternoon. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A thermally induced trough will extend northward along the
coast on Wednesday, allowing for flow to transition to offshore and
then persist through Thursday. The trough will move inland on
Friday, allowing for high pressure over the northeastern Pacific to
build back into the coastal waters and for flow to transition back
to onshore. During this period, northerly winds will be dominant
over the majority of waters, with periods of east winds through the
Strait of Juan de Fuca.

Seas will generally hover between 3 to 5 feet through Wednesday for
the Coastal Waters. Seas are expected to build again, this time
reaching 5 to 8 feet Thursday and Friday.

.FIRE WEATHER...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridging and an associated surface
thermal trough will be building and moving into western Washington
Wednesday into Thursday. This will allow for temperatures to begin
to rise and the air mass will begin to dry out and become unstable.
As fuels continue to dry, these conditions will combine to create
elevated to near-critical fire weather conditions over the mountains
on Thursday. A return to onshore flow over the Olympic Peninsula
will begin to bring cooler, moist air to the Olympics, but the
Cascades remain warm, dry and unstable. A Fire Weather Watch has
been issued for all the mountain zones for Thursday, going through
Friday as well for the Cascades. A return to onshore flow on Friday
looks to bring just enough moisture to relieve the Olympic mountains
of critical fire weather conditions, while conditions remain dry and
unstable through Friday over the Cascades.

Winds will also turn easterly over the Cascades beginning late on
Wednesday. While they will not be overly strong, a period of breezy
winds is expected late Wednesday night into early Thursday morning
as air funnels through the gaps over the Cascade crest. Another
period of offshore flow is expected Thursday night into Friday, but
it looks to be less strong.

Cooler and more moist air will return area-wide through the weekend
and into the beginning of next week. LH<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
