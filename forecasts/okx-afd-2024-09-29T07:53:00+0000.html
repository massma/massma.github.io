Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
353 AM EDT Sun Sep 29 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A stationary front remains south of the area today while high
pressure noses in from the northeast. The high remains Monday
through Tuesday night while low pressure slowly passes south of the
area. A cold front passes through Wednesday, followed by high
pressure through Saturday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge axis passes east today as an upper level low to
our southwest slowly weakens and approaches the area. At the
surface, a stalled frontal boundary remains to our south, with high
pressure nosing in from our northeast.

Light rain/drizzle continues over the area this morning and chances
remain through the day. Highest confidence in precipitation is for
NYC and northeast NJ, with eastern CT and eastern LI likely
remaining dry because of high pressure building in from the
northeast. The pressure gradient over the area remains relatively
tight early today, but slowly weakens through the day. 20 to 25 mph
gusts are expected again through the afternoon.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure remains nosing in from the northeast while low
pressure passes to our south during the short term period. With high
pressure more established over the area on Monday, we will
likely be dry. The next chance of PoPs will be late Monday night
through Tuesday with low pressure passing to our south. The PoP
forecast for this has trended down and decided to go lower than
the NBM. The global models keep the northern edge of rain
offshore to our south. This will depend on strength of the high
to our north and exact track of the low. Either way at this time
no hydrologic impacts are expected.

Stuck close to NBM for temps during this period.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Relatively tame pattern sets up mid to late week. Weak high pressure
briefly builds in behind the exiting offshore low Wednesday as a
trough digs over the Upper Great Lakes. This will send a cold front
toward the region, passing through by Wednesday evening. Best
forcing appears well to the north, and moisture will be limited, so
not anticipating much in the way of impacts from the fropa, perhaps
a few showers ahead of the boundary Wed evening across the northern
interior. More likely, the front moves through dry, with clearing
skies into Thursday as high pressure quickly rebuilds behind it. The
high slips offshore by Friday, but ridging remains in place to start
the upcoming weekend. Another cold front may approach Saturday, but
global ensembles once again keep this weak locally, with potentially
little impact.

Temperatures remain near to just above normal for early autumn.
Afternoon highs generally range from the upper 60s to mid 70s, with
morning lows into the 40s and 50s. The national blend was followed
for this update.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION /08Z SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A stationary front remains south of the region through tonight.

Mainly IFR ceilings this morning with intermittent drizzle or light
rain. Likely some fluctuation between MVFR and IFR. Visibilities
with the light rain and some patchy fog will vary mainly between
MVFR and VFR.

Rain chances gradually decrease through the day, but spotty light
rain into the afternoon cannot be ruled out. Expecting ceilings to
lift from IFR to MVFR during this time. Improvement to VFR possible
by early evening, becoming likely tonight.

Winds will be from the east near 10 kt through the TAF period. Some
15-20 kt gusts will be possible along the coast in the afternoon,
but likely more occasional.

     NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Amendments likely today with changing flight categories.

Occasional gusts to near 20 kt possible this afternoon.

Timing of improvement to VFR may be off by a couple of hours.

OUTLOOK FOR 06Z MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...

Late Tonight: Improving to VFR.

Monday: Mainly VFR. Chance of rain late Monday into Monday night
with MVFR.

Tuesday: MVFR/IFR with a chance of rain. ENE wind gusts 15-20 kt,
diminishing at night.

Wednesday: Mainly VFR. Slight chance of rain.

Thursday: VFR.
