Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
953 AM PDT Mon Jun 23 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak upper level ridging is building behind the low
pressure system moving east, keeping warmer and drier
conditions in the forecast through the middle of the week,
though skies remain mostly cloudy. Expect light rain showers and
cooler temperatures through the end of the week. A warming
trend is in store for this weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No significant updates
this morning to the forecast. Refer to the previous discussion
below and updated aviation section.

Latest satellite imagery shows clouds continuing to scatter
across the interior, while overcast conditions persist across the
coast and Strait of Juan de Fuca this morning. We should be able
to get some more scattering of the low level clouds this
afternoon, but high clouds will also begin to move in tonight as a
weak upper- level shortwave moves through. Highs today should be
warmer than yesterday, in the low to mid 70s. Another weak
shortwave will move through Tuesday night, keeping skies mostly
cloudy and reinforcing onshore flow. As such, temperatures Tuesday
will only be a few degrees warmer than today, in the upper 70s,
with some low 80s possible in the Cascade valleys. On Wednesday, a
larger and more moist upper level trough will move through the
area, which will introduce an associated frontal system that will
move through Wednesday. PoPs increase, with the best chances for
seeing light rain along the coast and the northern Cascades.
Temperatures will also cool off, with highs in the upper 60s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A few additional shortwaves
push through the area Thursday into Friday, keeping chances for
light rain in the forecast through Friday morning. Conditions look
to dry out Friday afternoon and into the weekend as an upper level
ridge begins to build and move into the area. We will also begin to
see a warming trend Friday into the weekend, with the potential
return into the 80s by Sunday. As with all possibilities with
significant lead time, exact details will continue to evolve.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak upper ridging will bring light westerly flow
aloft through today. It`s mainly a mix of VFR/MVFR cigs across
the area terminals this morning. Satellite shows stratus has
made it into the Southwest Interior and portions of the Sound
all the way to the Northern Cascades this morning. The only
areas remaining clear this morning are portions of the central
and south Sound. Though, the latest satellite imagery is already
indicating stratus slowly retreating across the interior. Cigs
across the interior will improve back to VFR midday through the
afternoon with high clouds streaming overhead at times. MVFR
cigs may continue for the immediate coast through this
afternoon. Light southerly winds this morning will transition to
more W/NW this afternoon.

KSEA...VFR conditions. Latest satellite imagery shows stratus
staying out of the terminal. Predominantly light SW winds this
morning, transitioning to NW this afternoon (between 22z-00z).
Winds will become more northerly tonight. JD/SB<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure will build over the waters
through today. Generally light winds are expected today with
weak onshore flow. Onshore flow will increase late Tuesday,
which may bring Small Craft Advisory west winds through the
central and eastern portions of the Strait of Juan de Fuca
Tuesday evening. At this time, probabilities peak around 50 to
70% for gusts of 25 kts late Tuesday for this region. Onshore
flow will then continue through late this week. Northerly winds
may increase over the Coastal Waters next weekend with high
pressure building over the area.

Seas of 3 to 5 feet will continue through the week. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
