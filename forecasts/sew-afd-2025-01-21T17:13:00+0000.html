Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
913 AM PST Tue Jan 21 2025

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Another chilly start to the morning with temperatures
in the upper 20s to low 30s. Currently mostly clear skies across
most of Western Washington.

Overall the current forecast remains on track and no
significant updates are needed at this time. Please refer to the
previous discussion below and updated aviation section.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...Weak system moving by to the north today will weaken
the upper level ridge over the area. The ridge will rebuild
tonight and remain in place into Wednesday night. Thursday the
ridge will slowly drift west allowing a system to drop down from
the northwest across Western Washington Thursday night. Ridge
rebuilding strongly over the area later Friday through the
weekend into the first part of next week.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge over the
area the last couple of days flattening today as a weak shortwave
rides by to the north. Not much with this feature for Western
Washington other than some increasing clouds over the northern
portions later today. Lots of places have temperature dew point
spreads of 1 degree or less so still a chance for patchy freezing
fog to develop before sunrise. What little that does form will be
gone pretty quickly once the sun comes up. Highs today in the
lower to mid 40s.

Upper level ridge rebuilding tonight into Wednesday. With the
clear skies overnight temperatures will once again drop into the
20s in many locations. Patchy freezing fog possible in the usual
fog prone locations like the Southwest Interior. Sunny skies
Wednesday. Highs continuing to be a couple of degrees below
normal, in the lower to mid 40s.

Another shortwave will move over the top of the ridge Wednesday
night. This feature will be just north of Vancouver Island by 12z
Thursday. Far enough north to keep skies over Western Washington
mostly clear overnight leading to another morning with lows
mostly in the 20s.

Upper level ridge retrograding slightly Thursday with the flow
aloft turning northwesterly. This will push the shortwave towards
Western Washington during the day but the feature will still be
north of the area by 00z Friday. Increasing clouds mainly in the
late morning and afternoon hours over the northern portions with
a slight chance of rain near the Canadian border in the afternoon.
Highs a little cooler with the increasing cloud cover, mostly in
the lower 40s.

Operational model runs differing on how much of the shortwave is
left as it moves into Western Washington Thursday night. As the
feature approaches the low level flow will turn weakly onshore.
Both the GFS and ECMWF keep 1000-850 mb thickness values above
1300 meters ( although not by much over Whatcom county ). Model
snow levels right now in the 1500-2000 foot range. Given the
pattern this looks a little high but with the low level onshore
flow snow levels should stay off the surface. Will not be
surprised if future runs drop the snow level closer to 1000 feet.
Even with the low snow levels the ECMWF dissipates the shortwave
almost completely by 12z Friday. ECMWF ensemble solutions have
about half with precipitation, but very light. The GFS
operational run is much wetter than the ECMWF but looking at the
GFS ensembles the operational run is the outlier with ensemble
solutions that do indicate precipitation, once again about half,
only indicating light precipitation. Even in the Cascades at this
point only looking at a couple inches of new snow.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement with the shortwave moving south out of the area Friday.
Upper level ridge offshore building strongly into Western
Washington and Southern British Columbia Friday night through the
weekend into the first part of next week. More of the same after
the clouds clear Friday. Sunny days and mostly clear nights with
patchy morning fog Saturday through Monday. Highs in the lower to
mid 40s. Lows in the 20s and lower 30s. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>West to northwest winds continue over western Washington
as a shortwave moves through the upper level ridge in place over the
region. VFR conditions prevail across most of the area with periodic
isolated areas of LIFR in patchy freezing fog (KPWT). VFR
conditions continue with high clouds moving through the region.
Another round of isolated patchy freezing fog may be possible
again Wednesday morning, particularly across the Southwest
Interior. Winds are mostly light to calm across the area and will
remain light through the TAF period.

KSEA...VFR conditions with high clouds overhead. Fog is not expected
at the terminal (10% probability), any fog that does develop should
be to the southwest of the terminal. VFR conditions remain through
the TAF period with high clouds. Light winds (3 to 7 kt), currently
east becoming south/southeast later this morning, switching back
over to north then northeast this evening.

62/28<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...High pressure will remain firmly in place over the coastal
waters through early Thursday for continuing tranquil conditions. A
weak front will move through Thursday night, allowing for northerly
winds to increase across the area, with Small Craft Advisory
strength winds likely across the outer coastal waters, with lower
probabilities as you get closer to land. Winds will ease through the
coastal waters during the day on Friday, but an increase in
northerly winds will also be possible through Admiralty Inlet into
the East Strait of Juan de Fuca on Friday before easing Friday
night. Winds will remain north to northeasterly over the area waters
this weekend as weak Fraser outflow winds develop.

Seas 6 to 7 ft this morning will begin to subside to around 3 to 5
ft on Wednesday. Seas will build Thursday night into Friday as the
front moves through reaching 8 to 13 ft across the area. Seas
subside Friday night back to around 4 to 6 this weekend.
