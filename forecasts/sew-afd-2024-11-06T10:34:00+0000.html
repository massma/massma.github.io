Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
234 AM PST Wed Nov 6 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge will begin to bring drier
conditions to the area tonight and over the next couple days. A
series of systems will bring rain, mountain snow, chance of
thunder, and breezy winds starting on Thursday evening and
continue through the middle of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A dry and cool morning early
today across western Washington with mid to high level cloud
cover and temperatures in the low 40s. These high clouds should
help to limit the fog potential this morning, through a few
isolated spots of patchy fog cannot be ruled out this morning.
Cloud coverage will decrease throughout the day today, allowing
for periods of sun, especially as you go southeast. Areas such as
Bellingham and the northern Pacific coast look to remain mostly
cloudy. High temperatures will reach the low to mid 50s. Tonight
looks to be mostly clear, with low temperatures falling into the
30s, with the coolest temperatures in the Southwest Interior.
Thursday and Friday will be warmer, with highs in the mid to upper
50s and lows in the 40s. Cloud cover will begin to increase on
Thursday as the next frontal system begins to approach the area.
The front will approach and and stall just northwest of the area
on Friday, allowing for chances for rain to begin as early as
Thursday night over the northwest Pacific Coast before slowly
spreading inland throughout the day on Friday. High snow levels
(above 6000 ft) will limit any mountain snowfall with this system.
This system looks to be the driest system win the forecast as we
go into a wetter and very active pattern into the long-term
period.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The aforementioned front
will move through on Saturday, with another system following on
its heels Sunday and slowly moving through Monday into early
Tuesday. Through the long-term period, periods of rain, mountain
snow (as snow levels lower to around 3000-3500 ft by Sunday), and
breezy winds. Several inches of rainfall is possible in some areas,
with a 45-65% chance of seeing over 4 inches of rain over the 72-hour
span from Saturday through Monday across the Pacific Coast, the
Olympics, and the northern Cascades. In this same time period,
there is a 75% chance of seeing over 1 ft of snow at Stevens and
White Pass. At this time, snow levels look to remain high enough
that Snoqualmie Pass will receive up to a few inches of snow
through these three days.

Ensemble cluster analysis and each of the deterministic model
solutions all reveal slight variance in the exact evolution,
timing, and magnitude of the systems that move through Friday and
into early next week, but overall the pattern and probabilities
favor significant rainfall, mountain snow, and breezy winds
through the long term period. With the active pattern,
temperatures look to remain static, with highs in the low 50s and
lows in the 40s. LH<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest flow aloft will become westerly today as
upper ridge axis shifts inland. Primarily VFR expected today as mid
and high level clouds stream across the region, but patchy morning
LIFR/IFR stratus/fog remains possible across south Puget Sound and
the Southwest Interior. Less mid and high clouds tonight is expected
to lead to greater coverage of low clouds on Thursday morning.

KSEA...Mid and high clouds today. Possible low stratus forming over
Lake Washington after sunrise could float near the terminal 15z-18z.
Surface winds light E/SE this morning becoming northerly in the
afternoon. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will remain over the waters Wednesday and
Thursday. A weakening front will arrive on Friday before a stronger
system arrives over the weekend.

Seas of 5 to 7 ft should remain in this general range before
starting to increase Thursday evening ahead of a series of frontal
systems expected to pass through the waters over the weekend. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The next chance of significant precipitation is
forecasted to arrive Saturday through Monday. At this time, the
Skokomish River is the only river forecasted to rise above flood
stage. For other rivers, significant rises are expected and
flooding could be possible, but at this time is not forecasted.
The amount of flooding will depend on rainfall rates, temperatures
and snow levels with precipitation that falls with these systems.
