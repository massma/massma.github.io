Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
934 AM PDT Sun Oct 27 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A cold front is currently moving through the area,
bringing heavy rain. Behind the front, unstable conditions will
allow for showers to continue with a chance of thunderstorms
during the day, as well as breezy winds. Snow levels will fall low
enough for mountain snow above 4000 ft. A brief break is possible
late Monday and part of Tuesday before another system looks to
bring another round of rain, breezy winds, and mountain snow mid-
week.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Showery, breezy, and cooler
conditions will prevail today into tonight in a post-frontal air
mass. Isolated thunderstorms will be possible as well, mainly near
the coast. Current forecasts are on track. Previous discussion
follows with updates to marine/aviation sections. 27


A low pressure system currently centered near Haida Gwaii will
slowly move southeastward towards western Washington along the
British Columbia coast, with several fronts/surface troughs that
will maintain active weather today and into Monday. The main cold
front will pass through the area early this morning, bringing with
it a band of moderate rain. Behind the front, expect a more
convective mode with scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms.
Best chances for thunderstorms will be over the coastal waters and
Pacific Coast (20-30%). Lightning will be the primary impact, but
some small graupel/hail and heavy downpours cannot be ruled out in
any storms that develop. Behind the front, snow levels will drop to
around 4500 ft tomorrow, reaching 4000 ft Monday. The heaviest
mountain snow will be in the North Cascades, including the Mt. Baker
ski area. Additionally, the higher elevation mountain passes above
4500, including Washington Pass, will see several inches of snow
accumulation tonight into early tomorrow. A rain/snow mix may begin
in the high-elevation passes as early as this morning. Additionally,
winds will remain breezy through the day and into Monday, but look
to remain under advisory thresholds.

Precipitation chances and breezy winds will begin to cease Monday
night as the low pressure system continues to fill in and move south
out of the region. A weak surface ridge will try and push into the
region Tuesday, but another strong cold front is on its heels.

With the wet pattern through the short term, temperatures will not
waver much each day. There will be a slight cooling trend, with
highs in the mid 50s and lows in the 40s.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Models are in good
agreement that a substantial low pressure system will push
southeastward towards the area, pushing a cold front across the area
on Wednesday. There looks to be slightly less moisture with this
system, but with snow levels falling to 3000 to 3500 ft, the
mountains will see good chances for accumulating snow, including the
passes. Chances for rain and snow continue through late week, with
the associated upper-level trough slowly moving through the region.
Models are beginning to hint at the potential for ridging develop
over the east Pacific and follow this system, which could indicate a
trend towards drier and slightly warmer conditions next weekend.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Steady rain has transitioned to showers across the
region with gusty surface winds continuing. Expect scattered to
broken VFR cloud deck to prevail for most terminals, though brief
locally reduced conditions are possible under heavier showers. A few
isolated thunderstorms are possible through the day (generally
around a 15% chance), but confidence in timing or placement
precludes TAF inclusion at this times.

KSEA...Rain showers through the day. Expect predominantly VFR
ceilings (perhaps even scattering at times in between showers)
through the day, with brief occasional reductions in ceilings and
visibility as stronger showers pass across the terminal. Gusty
southerly winds remain through the day with gusts to 25 kt this
afternoon and tonight. Little change through daybreak Monday with
easing winds and decreasing showers later Monday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system moving across the area today will
bring breezy southerly winds to the coastal waters and portions of
the interior waters through much of the day today, with hi-res
guidance showing gusts to 25-30 kt likely. Isolated thunderstorms
will be possible across the area waters through the day and may
bring erratic winds, reduced visibilities, and lightning to portions
of the waters today.

The pattern will generally remain active as a strong low pressure
system sinks southward from the Gulf of Alaska and into the region
on Monday before pushing inland Monday night into Tuesday. High
pressure then looks to build back into the coastal waters on Tuesday
before another strong frontal system moves into the area waters on
Wednesday. A low over the Gulf of Alaska then looks to sink
southward into the region on Thursday, keeping conditions active
across the waters.

Seas are currently hovering between 8-11 ft early this morning will
build towards 16-18 ft today. Seas will gradually subside through
Sunday, but look to stay above 10 ft through Monday. Seas may
briefly fall below 10 ft under the influence of higher pressure on
Tuesday, however expect this to remain short-lived as the strong
frontal system moving into the region midweek allows for seas to
build above 10 ft again. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...Several systems will track across western Washington,
with periods of showers today into Monday, as well as another system
mid-week. Snow levels will slowly lower from 5000 ft early Sunday to
below 4000 ft on Monday. With an additional 1 to 3 inches of rain in
the forecast across the Olympic and Cascade mountains through
Monday, rises are expected on area rivers. Wednesday`s front may
bring another round of 1 to 3 inches over the Olympics, through snow
levels will be lower (around 3000 to 3500 ft). Currently no rivers
are forecasted to reach flood stage, but rivers will need to be
monitored, in particular the Skokomish, which is forecasted to
approach Action stage on Monday and again late this week.
