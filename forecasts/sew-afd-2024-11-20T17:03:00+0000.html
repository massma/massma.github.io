Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
903 AM PST Wed Nov 20 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Large upper level low off the coast through the
weekend. No organized fronts spinning out of the low the next two
days but the cool and somewhat unstable air mass over the area
will keep showers in the forecast. Thunderstorms possible along
the coast today. Next front arriving Friday. Unsettled weather
continuing through the weekend into the first part of next week.

&&

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Wind concerns have died down this morning over inland
areas and higher elevations. Still will see some breezy winds
through the morning and early afternoon along the North Coast, but
will continue to decrease throughout the day. Thunderstorms are
also continuing along the coast (primarily in Grays Harbor County)
that will produce lightning, and potentially brief heavy rains and
possible small hail/gusty winds. The winter weather advisory
continues for the North Cascades with continuing snow
accumulations through the afternoon. The coastal flooding and high
surf headlines will also continue through the afternoon for San
Juan/western Whatcom Counties, and the North Coast/Central Coast
areas.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Satellite imagery shows the
front falling apart over the Cascades early this morning. Winds
have eased dramatically since 1 am/09z and all of the wind
warnings and advisories have ended. Doppler radar has shower
activity west of Puget Sound with a few thunderstorms off the
coast. Temperatures at 4 am were mostly in the 40s.

Winds will continue to ease this morning as the possibly record
breaking strong surface low moves away from the coast. Cool
unstable air mass settling in over Western Washington with
widespread shower activity. Thunderstorm chances will continue
west of Puget Sound. Doppler radar indicating good chance the
current thunderstorms off the coast producing hail down to the
surface. Will include a chance of small hail with the
thunderstorms. Highs today in the mid 40s to lower 50s.

Little change in the weather pattern tonight through Thursday
with a huge upper level low off the coast. Two small lows
embedded in the center of the low will Fujiwara well offshore
with the low itself remaining stationary. Cool and unstable air
mass remaining over Western Washington keeping at least a chance
of showers in the forecast. Lows in the mid 30s to lower 40s.
Highs a couple of degrees either side of 50.

Organized front associated with a developing surface low in the
base of the upper level low turning towards Western Washington
Thursday night. 999 mb low at 00z Friday will deepen to around 985
mb while moving north northeast Thursday night. By early Friday
morning the low will be west of the mouth of the Columbia River
near 129W. Rain out ahead of the front spreading over the southern
portion of the area late. Lows in the lower to mid 40s.

Front moving through Western Washington Friday. Surface low will
continue to strengthen bottoming out near 975 mb. Winds increasing
Friday morning with the potential for wind advisories along the
coast and over the Northwest Interior. If the low deepens a little
more than the models indicate or the track is a little further
east could need a high wind warning for the coast Friday. Warm air
out ahead of the front will push highs into the mid 50s.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...General agreement in the
extended models that an upper level low will remain offshore into
the weekend. Nothing organized getting kicked out of the low but
like today and tomorrow the cool and somewhat unstable air mass
over the area will keep at least a chance of showers in the
forecast. Models trending drier for Monday and Tuesday as the low
begins to retrograde to the west opening the door for a possible
weak upper level ridge to build into the area from the southeast.
The GFS ensembles are mostly dry after 12z Monday but the ECMWF
ensembles have plenty of wet solutions Monday with about half the
solutions wet for Tuesday. Models have been having trouble with
the pattern in days 6 and 7 for a few runs. Would like to see a
more dry runs before taking the chance of showers out of the
forecast for Monday and Tuesday. Felton

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A deep upper level low continues to spin offshore
with strong south/southwesterly flow aloft. Ceilings remain a mix
of VFR/MVFR this morning as a front with showers moves across the
area. Scattered thunderstorms along the coast this morning, will
remain possible through the day. MVFR conditions will remain hit
or miss - mainly along with showers. Otherwise, widespread VFR
conditions will return by afternoon. Southeasterly surface winds
5- 10 knots with occasional gusts up to 15 to 20 knots still
possible throughout the morning.

KSEA...VFR this morning with periods of MVFR possible as shower pass
through the area this morning. E/SE surface winds this morning
around 5 to 10 knots. Can see some locally breezy conditions with
gusts up to 15 to 20 kts near the terminal through the morning, but
will gradually decrease into the afternoon. VFR will likely remain
throughout the TAF period barring any heavier showers.

.MARINE...A strong robust area of low pressure will continue to
impact the coastal waters this morning as it meanders over the
offshore waters. A Storm Force Warning will remain in effect for
the coastal waters and the Strait of Juan De Fuca until later this
morning to account for wind gusts still around 50 to 60 kts, per
recent observations this morning. These winds will decrease but
still remain elevated, therefore Gale Warnings will follow in
place for the coastal waters, the Strait of Juan De Fuca, and the
Northern Inland Waters for the remainder of the day.

Combined seas this morning are 25 to 30 feet over the outer
coastal waters, with 20 to 24 feet closer to the coastline.
Elevated seas are still possible along the Strait of Juan De Fuca
where greater fetch combined with the strong easterly wind over
the last 12 hours could still potentially generate seas of 7-10
feet. Along with steep seas, severe bar conditions will develop
early this morning at Grays Harbor Bar throughout the afternoon,
especially around the ebb currents. With large waves along the
immediate coast, winds from the east - these factors will
contribute for waves to continue to steepen.

Seas will start to gradually subside tonight into Thursday
morning, but will still remain above 10 feet. A brief break in
active weather will be short lived as guidance is signaling
another deep low pressure system to spin over our coastal waters
into Friday, potentially bringing back high seas (20+ feet) and
another round of strong winds.

.HYDROLOGY...Rain over the south slopes of the Olympics overnight
will push the Skokomish River up to near flood stage today. The
river will recede tonight into Thursday. The Skokomish River will
rise again Friday with another round of rain moving into the area.
There is a better chance the river goes above flood stage Friday
than today. The river will recede again over the weekend.

For the remainder of the river no flooding is expected. Lower
snow levels in the Cascades will limit runoff and reduce any
flooding chances for rivers flowing off the Cascades.
Precipitation for the remainder of the period will come in bursts.
This combined with snow levels remaining relatively low will keep
rivers in their banks. Felton
