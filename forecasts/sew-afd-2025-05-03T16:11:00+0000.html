.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Unsettled weather will persist today as an upper
level trough moves across the region. High pressure will then
build back into the area on Sunday, bringing warmer and drier
conditions to western Washington through early next week.
Chances of showers will increase again near midweek as the ridge
of high pressure moves further inland and the next system
approaches the coast.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Radar shows some light
shower activity persisting across the Sound and Cascades early
this morning in the wake of a frontal system that traversed the
area. Cloudy and unsettled conditions will continue today as an
upper level trough moves inland across the region. Latest hi-res
guidance suggests light showers will persist across the south
and central Sound through the morning hours, however, expect
showers to gradually become more confined to the mountains
throughout the day. Afternoon high temperatures will cool from
yesterday, with most areas only expected to make it into the mid
50s to low 60s.

The upper level trough will then move off to the east on Sunday
as upper level ridging starts to nudge back into the Pacific
Northwest. This will mark the start of a warming and drying trend
heading into the first part of next week. High temperatures on
Sunday will warm a few degrees from Saturday`s highs and will top
out in the upper 50s to mid 60s.

The ridge of high pressure will continue to build into the area
on Monday, maintaining warm and dry conditions across western
Washington. Afternoon highs will warm into the mid 60s to low 70s
across the interior, which will reintroduce areas of Minor
(Yellow) HeatRisk to portions of the interior lowlands. Areas
along the coast will remain cooler, with highs generally expected
to trend in the low to mid 60s.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.LONG TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Tuesday continues to
look like it will be the warmest day of the week as high
pressure remains situated across the region. Afternoon highs
will warm a couple more degrees and look to top out in the mid
to upper 60s for areas along the coast and in the 70s across the
interior. A few spots along the Cascade foothills and valleys
may even approach 80. As a result, Minor (Yellow) HeatRisk will
become more widespread across the interior lowlands.

The pattern then looks to change near midweek with ensemble
clusters in good agreement that the upper level ridge will start
to push further inland over the central US and troughing will
start to take hold over the northeastern Pacific. A weak system
looks to move into the area on Wednesday, with ensembles indicating
the best chances of precipitation being along the North Coast and
the Central and North Cascades. Some variability remains in the
pattern heading into late week, but at this time, generally expect
drier and milder conditions for western Washington Thursday and
Friday. 14<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

..AVIATION...Southwesterly flow aloft as upper level troughing
approaches from the west. Cigs early this morning range from VFR to
MVFR with isolated pockets of IFR where the rain is presently
consolidated, namely around KPAE. Coastal terminals have generally
cleared this morning with northwesterly surface winds of 7 to 9 kts.
Throughout the rest of Puget Sound, expect MVFR cigs to linger until
around 18Z, with shower activity tapering. VFR to return for the
afternoon with a transition to area-wide northwesterly flow between
7 and 10 kts after 20Z. Winds will be gusty through the Strait of
Juan de Fuca this afternoon, impacting KCLM.

KSEA...Cigs are oscillating between MVFR and VFR early this morning,
with intermittent showers expected through around 18Z. Surface winds
out of the northeast will likely transition to northwesterly
after 19Z-20Z at 7 to 10 kts. VFR cigs are expected throughout the
rest of the day. Lighter ENE flow possible late tonight,
generally after 06Z.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A Small Craft Advisory remains in effect for the
Central and Eastern Strait for an onshore push through 8 AM
local time. With a ridge forming over the coastal waters and low
pressure moving east of the Cascades, another onshore push is
expected tonight, with west winds of 20 to 30 kts expected
through the Strait of Juan de Fuca. A second Small Craft
Advisory has been posted for this event this afternoon.

Coastal seas hovering around 4 to 6 feet will increase slightly to
6 to 8 feet throughout the weekend.
