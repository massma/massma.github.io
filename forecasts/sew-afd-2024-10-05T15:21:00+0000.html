Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
821 AM PDT Sat Oct 5 2024

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No major forecast updates this morning. Areas of fog
continue to remain across the valleys in the Southwest Interior,
Kitsap Peninsula, and in some of the river valleys including the
Chehalis and the Snohomish/Snoqualmie. Fog should break out
quickly in the next hour or two, leaving mostly sunny skies with
high clouds to the northwest as a front passes by into British
Columbia. Light offshore flow should allow temperatures to rise
into the 60s today. See the previous discussion below, as well as
updates to the aviation and marine sections. LH<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...Patchy fog and low clouds are developing in portions
of western Washington this morning as high pressure builds back
into the region. Slightly warmer temperatures are forecast for
today and Sunday, likely peaking on Monday. Rain chances then
return for the middle of the week.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Fog and stratus is developing
across the central and southern Sound region, as well as some in
the Southwest Interior. This will be a feature that lingers
through much of the morning before scattering out, revealing a
mostly sunny afternoon with highs in the mid to upper 60s.
Similar temperatures are forecast for Sunday, with highs likely
peaking in the low 70s by Monday. The upper level pattern shows
the present ridge nudging east on Monday, keeping a chance of rain
in the forecast for far northwestern Washington. The majority of
the region should likely only see light rain amounts at about a
tenth of an inch or less, with only up to a quarter inch expected
in the windward slopes of the Olympic mountains.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Agreement in the cluster
analysis is solid for Tuesday, showing the trough moving through
Washington, with the ridge well established over the Intermountain
West. Only a few light showers are likely to remain on Wednesday,
quickly scattering out.

As the ensembles move out to Thursday and into Friday, the
location of the ridge axis over the west will be key in
determining how zonal or not the flow will be in western
Washington, and whether or not this will fully close off the
region from receiving additional precipitation in the late week
timeframe. If the Climate Prediction Center`s 6 to 10 day and 8 to
14 day outlooks are any indication of the extended pattern, more
significant probabilities of above average temperatures and below
average precipitation are favored. This is the case for a large
swath of the CONUS, prolonging drought and fire weather concerns
over other parts of the west.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest flow aloft this morning will turn
westerly by this afternoon as a low amplitude upper ridge axis
shifts onshore over Western Washington. Light and variable surface
winds for much of the morning before becoming more northerly with
speeds generally 4-8 kts...although up to 10 kts possible near water.

Areas of MVFR/IFR conditions in low stratus and patchy fog will
linger throughout the late morning before widespread VFR returns
this afternoon and evening. Cigs may degrade late tonight for
terminals west of the Puget Sound and patchy fog may develop east of
the Sound early Sunday morning, however persistent VFR conditions
likely for remaining locations.

KSEA...VFR with low clouds continuing to scatter out this morning.
S/SE surface winds will shift to northerly by 18-19z staying 5-8 kt
through the evening. Models continue to show potential for patchy
fog development mid-morning Sunday which may cause short-lived
MVFR/IFR conditions, but confidence remains low.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A surface ridge will shift inland today turning the
flow northerly or weakly offshore tonight into Sunday. A dissipating
cold front will approach the coastal waters Sunday night into Monday
with an increase in southerlies for portions of the coastal waters,
but otherwise little to no impact. Latest forecast suggests that SCA
level winds may be possible, but at this time appears to be a very
borderline situation. At this time, will leave any headline
decisions to next shift in the hopes future model runs will provide
better clarity. Another weak system may follow Tuesday into
Wednesday, but confidence in the overall forecast picture by that
time period is low.
