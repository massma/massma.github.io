Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
825 PM PDT Sat May 17 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough will continue to produce
showers through the weekend. Additional disturbances will bring
showers across the region into the new week, with precipitation
chances decreasing by mid-week. Temperatures will slowly climb a few
degrees as the forecast progresses, with highs climbing from around
60 to near 70 in the lowlands.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Two main areas of precip on
current radar worth monitoring. Over the western half of the CWA,
scattered showers continue to creep slowly southeastward. The other
area is a large convergence zone over much of Snohomish county and
the northern half of King county. Doppler estimated rainfall rates
largely ranging up to 0.3 inches per hour...the highest of which are
mainly present over the Cascade foothills...but there is a slug of
moisture in central King county generating 0.3-0.5 inches per hour.
Thankfully, this activity has missed lingering burn scars, but this
will need to be monitored. Hi-res guidance continues to show this
feature lingering into tonight before finally fizzling out early
Sunday morning. Any lightning associated with precip has remained
well out of the CWA and with the loss of the sun, should be able to
put that threat to bed.

Inherited forecast handles the above well and thus no need for an
evening update at this time. For additional forecast details, please
refer to the Previous Discussion section below.

From Previous Discussion...There are showers across western WA with
a trough passing through, and a convergence zone over the
central/north sound. The air mass is slightly unstable for a chance
of thunderstorms too, especially in the Cascades and convergence
zone. Snow levels will be lowering down to 3500-4000` tonight with
light snow in the mountains and passes as well.

An upper low tracks overhead on Sunday although shower activity is
overall less organized over the lowlands and mainly impacting the
Cascades. Temperatures will continue to trend cooler than average
with highs around 60.

More wet weather is on its way on Monday as another Pacific
frontal system moves in. It`ll be breezy too along the coast and
north interior. We`re under broad troughing and onshore flow on
Tuesday for additional showers and ongoing cooler temps. 33

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...We`re under
zonal/westerly flow through the rest of the week with ongoing
onshore flow. Weak systems will clip through the area for a chance
of showers each day. A ridge starts to build over the weekend for
drier and warmer conditions. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
