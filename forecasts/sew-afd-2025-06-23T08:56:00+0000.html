Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
156 AM PDT Mon Jun 23 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak upper level ridging is building behind the low
pressure system moving east, keeping warmer and drier conditions
in the forecast through the middle of the week, though skies
remain mostly cloudy. Expect light rain showers and cooler
temperatures through the end of the week. A warming trend is in
store for this weekend.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A broken stratus deck
remains in place over much of western Washington this morning. We
should be able to get some more scattering of the low level clouds
this afternoon, but high clouds will also begin to move in tonight
as a weak upper-level shortwave moves through. Highs today should be
warmer than yesterday, in the low to mid 70s. Another weak shortwave
will move through Tuesday night, keeping skies mostly cloudy and
reinforcing onshore flow. As such, temperatures Tuesday will only be
a few degrees warmer than today, in the upper 70s, with some low 80s
possible in the Cascade valleys. On Wednesday, a larger and more
moist upper level trough will move through the area, which will
introduce an associated frontal system that will move through
Wednesday. PoPs increase, with the best chances for seeing light
rain along the coast and the northern Cascades. Temperatures will
also cool off, with highs in the upper 60s.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...A few additional shortwaves
push through the area Thursday into Friday, keeping chances for
light rain in the forecast through Friday morning. Conditions look
to dry out Friday afternoon and into the weekend as an upper level
ridge begins to build and move into the area. We will also begin to
see a warming trend Friday into the weekend, with the potential
return into the 80s by Sunday. As with all possibilities with
significant lead time, exact details will continue to evolve.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Weak upper ridging will bring light westerly flow aloft
through today. A mix of VFR/MVFR cigs early this morning, with
clearing around portions of central and south Puget Sound. Onshore
flow will result in stratus spreading inland into the Southwest
Interior and portions of Puget Sound this morning. Elsewhere,
VFR/MVFR low to mid clouds will continue for northern Puget Sound
sites. Brief lowering in vsbys are possible this morning, mainly
around KOLM/KPWT due to light winds, although confidence remains
low. Cigs will improve to VFR midday through the afternoon with high
clouds at times. MVFR cigs may continue for the immediate coast at
times this afternoon. Light winds this morning will become more W/SW
this afternoon.

KSEA...VFR conditions with some clearing early this morning. Stratus
may redevelop over SEA this morning (mainly between 12 to 17z),
although confidence is low, with probabilities of MVFR cigs during
this period around 25-30%. Any stratus that does develop this
morning is expected to lift and scatter late morning with VFR
conditions this afternoon. Predominantly light SW winds this
morning, transitioning to NW this afternoon (between 22z-00z) with N
winds tonight. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface high pressure will build over the waters through
today. Generally light winds are expected today with weak onshore
flow. Onshore flow will increase late Tuesday, which may bring Small
Craft Advisory west winds through the central and eastern portions
of the Strait of Juan de Fuca Tuesday evening. At this time,
probabilities peak around 50 to 70% for gusts of 25 kts late Tuesday
for this region. Onshore flow will then continue through late this
week. Northerly winds may increase over the Coastal Waters next
weekend with high pressure building over the area.

Seas of 3 to 5 feet will continue through the week. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
