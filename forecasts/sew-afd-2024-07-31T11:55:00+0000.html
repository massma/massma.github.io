.SYNOPSIS...Upper level ridge building over Western Washington
today but light flow in the lower levels will keep low level
moisture over the area through the morning hours. Ridge
continuing to build tonight into Friday with temperatures warmer
each day. Ridge shifts east slightly over the weekend into the
first part of next week for a little cooler temperatures but
still well above normal for the interior.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Satellite imagery shows
cloudy skies over Western Washington early this morning. No
shower activity on the doppler radar. Temperatures at 3 am/10z
were in the upper 50s to mid 60s.

Marine layer not as deep this morning with tops near 3500 feet
versus the 6000 foot tops Tuesday morning. Light flow in the lower
levels will keep the cloud cover around for the morning hours but
the combination of late July sunshine and subsidence from the
upper level ridge building will take care of the marine this afternoon.
Surface gradients going northwesterly this afternoon which will
put a cap on the heating especially near the water. For the most
part highs 5 to 10 degrees warmer than Tuesday, in the 70s to mid
80s. Dew points will be a couple of degrees either side of 60
making it feel a little muggy today.

Upper level ridge, with 500 mb heights in the mid to upper 580 dms
tonight, continuing to build through Friday. By 00z Saturday 500
mb heights in the lower to mid 590 dms. Cross cascade gradient
never goes negative and 850 mb winds for the most part do not
turn easterly and are 10 knots or less through the period. 850 mb
temperatures in the plus 14C to 18C range tonight warming to plus
20C to 24C Thursday afternoon and remain in that range through
Friday. Highs Thursday in the upper 70s to near 90 with highs over
the interior a couple of degrees warmer Friday. Highs on the
coast Friday a little cooler with some afternoon onshore flow.
Lows both nights in the mid 50s to mid 60s.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Extended models in good
agreement with the upper level ridge sliding a little to the east
and a weak upper level trough forming off the coast. Will have to
be on the lookout for weak shortwaves ejecting out of the trough
moving into the very warm and unstable air mass over the higher
terrain possibly generating some convection late in the day.
Right now the models are not really showing anything along these
lines but this is not uncommon as these features will be very weak
and would get picked up better in the higher resolution shorter
term models. In the meantime with the ridge a little further to
the east low level flow remaining onshore in varying degrees. Even
with the ridge movement temperatures aloft remaining very warm.
This will keep high temperatures above normal through the period
for the interior with upper 70s to near 90 each day but Saturday
were a little bit stronger onshore flow will keep highs in the mid
70s to upper 80s. Lows each morning in the mid 50s to lower 60s
with lows in the metro area a couple of degrees warmer. Felton

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Zonal flow aloft as an upper ridge slowly builds into
western Washington. A mixed bag of ceilings out there early this
morning as stratus spreads across interior terminals for lower
cigs/vsbys. Generally seeing a mix of MVFR/IFR across area
terminals with LIFR in localized pockets near KPWT, KHQM, and
KPAE. MVFR/IFR will continue early this morning before slowly
scattering out late this afternoon (20z-22z). Light southerly
winds this morning will transition to a more N/NW component late
Wednesday afternoon, around 5 to 10 knots.

KSEA...IFR/LIFR early this morning as stratus hovers over the
terminal. Conditions will slowly rebound to VFR between 18z-22z.
Light southerly winds this morning will turn north/northwesterly
after 19z between 4 to 8 to knots.

.MARINE...Surface high pressure offshore will build through the
rest of the week with diurnally driven northerly winds over the
coastal waters. Winds look to remain under any advisory threshold.

Coastal seas generally 3 to 5 feet through the end of the week
before gradually building upwards to 6 to 7 feet, mainly for the
outer coastal water zones. These seas combined with a shorter
period could result in steep seas, especially farther offshore in
the outer water zones throughout the weekend. Seas will subside
to 3 to 5 feet in the beginning of next week.
