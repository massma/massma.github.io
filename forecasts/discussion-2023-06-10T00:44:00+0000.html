Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
844 PM EDT Fri Jun 9 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
Weak low pressure meanders nearby through tonight before shifting
away from the area on Saturday as high pressure builds in. The
high pressure exits offshore late Sunday. Low pressure moves east
into the area Monday into Tuesday with a cold front late Monday.
The region will be in between low pressure systems Wednesday with
next low pressure system coming from Southeast Canada. A cold
front associated with this low pressure system moves in Thursday.

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SATURDAY MORNING/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Quick update for the weather and probabilities, with
precipitation/showers more scattered, and threat of small hail
has ended.

The forecast remains on track. Only temperates and dewpoints
have minor adjustments to account for current observations and
trends.

Scattered showers are in response to an upper level low
spinning over northern New England, with a shortwave rotating
around it allowing for weak forcing.

The convective activity is beginning to weaken with loss of
daytime heating and the exit of the shortwave energy this
evening, with the region expected to be predominantly dry
overnight.

Air quality at the surface has improved considerably as much of
the low level smoke that had been impacting the region the past
week has largely exited, though some haze remains with elevated
concentrations of smoke aloft. With the improved air quality
only NJ continues with and Air Quality Alert through midnight.

Lows tonight range from the upper 40s and low 50s inland to the
middle and upper 50s close to the coast.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /6 AM SATURDAY MORNING THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT/...
Trough axis slides offshore as the upper low lifts northeast
into Canada. Heights begin to rise in response, beginning a
gradual warm up into the weekend.

Weak surface high pressure builds in from the west, with a light
W/NW flow expected through the day. Hi-res models indicate
smoke fields remain clear of the region at the surface (for the
time being), with some remaining aloft that could add a bit of
haze to skies. With the trough slow to exit, expecting diurnal
cloud cover and the possibility of a few showers, particularly
across the interior, with cyclonic flow and steepened lapse
rates from the cold pool aloft. Coverage is expected to be
considerably less than Friday`s activity however.

Temperatures return to closer to normal values on Saturday;
highs largely range from the mid 70s to around 80 in the urban
metro, and lows bottom out in the 50s and 60s by early Sunday
morning. Largely followed a superblend of guidance for this
update.

&&

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
Surface high pressure will be in control Sunday associated with a
mid-level ridge. Mid levels convey ridge moving east of the region
Monday. Low-level warm air advection with southerly winds will lead
to warm temperatures with highs in the low/mid-80s except for
coastal areas in the upper-70s. A cutoff mid level low moves in
early to mid week from the Great Lakes. This low eventually opens up
with more of a trough structure setting up north of the area for
Thursday next week.

At the surface, main parent low moves into Great Lakes on Monday
with an approaching warm front. A secondary area of low pressure
develops along this front as it moves across Monday night into
Tuesday. Low pressure will be slow to exit as it moves just into the
Gulf of Maine Tuesday into Tuesday night. Then, that parent low from
the Great Lakes weakens and moves in for midweek. This will bring an
associated cold front into the area for Thursday. A low will linger
over the Canadian Maritimes

Rain showers are in the forecast early through mid next week along
with possible thunderstorms most days, mainly afternoon into early
evening, especially Monday and Wednesday. Yet more rain showers are
in the forecast Thursday with the next cold front moving in.

Temperatures will not deviate much from normal for next week.

&&

.AVIATION /01Z SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
Weak low pressure moves slowly east of the terminals through
tonight. Weak pressure will remain across the area Saturday with
a surface trough developing during the afternoon.

VFR through the forecast period. With the development of the
trough scattered light showers will be possible during Saturday
afternoon, however will not include in the TAFs as probabilities
remain low. No impacts to ceilings or visibility expected.

Winds will be light to near calm tonight and become NW to W
saturday morning. Sea breezes are likely along the Connecticut
coast early in the afternoon, and at the Long Island terminals
mid to late afternoon.


 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

Any showers will be ending early this evening and uncertain that
showers will affect any terminal, so will use VCSH. Winds may be
variable as showers move through.

Timing of the sea breeze at KJFK may be an hour or two early
than forecast. The sea breeze may not reach KLGA, and the sea
breeze is not expected at KEWR and KTEB.


OUTLOOK FOR 00Z SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...

Saturday night-Sunday: VFR.

Monday: Rain showers with MVFR or lower. Slight chance of a
thunderstorm mainly afternoon into evening. SE gusts near 20 kt
during the day.

Tuesday: Chance of MVFR in -SHRA.

Wednesday: Chance of MVFR in -TSRA/-SHRA.
