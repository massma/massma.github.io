Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
347 PM PDT Fri Jun 7 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Generally dry and warm conditions will persist over
the area into early next week. A more typical June pattern
becomes more likely mid week onward with morning clouds, and near
normal temperatures. Wetter weather is possible late in the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Sunny skies and warmer
temperatures this afternoon will shift smoothly into a clear
pleasant evening with morning clouds along the coast and a clear
mostly sunning morning for the remaining area. The Upper level
ridge over the area tonight will begin to shift into Eastern
Washington Saturday. Low level flow will fully turn onshore in
the afternoon with temperatures similar to today over the
interior with another round of 70s to lower 80s. Temperatures
along the coast will cool back down into the 60s.


A weak upper level trough with limited moisture will reach the
area Sunday with increasing onshore flow, more cloud cover
Saturday night into Sunday and a chance showers and a 15-20%
chance of isolated thunder in the Cascades Sunday. High
temperatures on Sunday will trend to the low to mid 70s over the
interior and low to mid 60s along the coast. Monday will trend
drier with temperatures remaining above normal for the interior,
into the low to mid 70s and mid 60s for the coast.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Onshore flow and a the
potential for a weak system mid week will elevate the potential
for light morning showers or drizzle along the coast and Olympic
Peninsula and cooler temperatures overall with highs in the
interior in the mid 60s to upper 60s. The grand ensemble continues
to highlight elevated probabilities of an upper level trough
pattern over the Pacific Northwest late in the week - hinting at a
shift towards a wet end to the week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper-ridge axis just over the area this afternoon with
west-northwesterly winds aloft. Upper winds look to turn more
southwesterly into Saturday morning as the ridge tracks eastward.
VFR conditions are expected through much of the upcoming TAF period.
The only exception however may be KHQM with 30-40% chance of MVFR-
IFR ceilings developing around 08-12z Saturday but should burn off
towards midday.

KSEA...VFR throughout the TAF period with a few passing high clouds.
Northerly winds between 8 to 12 kt with gusts up to 15 to 18 kt this
afternoon but should decrease during the evening and become variable
(possibly out the south for a couple of hours) into the early
morning hours on Saturday.

.MARINE...Prevailing northerly flow over the coastal waters today.
High pressure will slide east of the Cascades on Saturday with a
return of stout onshore flow. A SCA has been issued for both the
central and eastern sections of Strait of Juan de Fuca. High
pressure over the NE Pacific will maintain onshore flow through
Sunday with continued SCA level winds through the aforementioned
areas. A front is forecast to cross western WA Monday night.

Seas 4 to 6 feet but rising to 8 to 10 feet Saturday night. Seas are
expected to fall well-below 10 ft on Monday but may rise again
towards midweek.
