Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
843 AM PST Sun Mar 2 2025

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Latest radar shows light shower activity over the
northern Olympic Peninsula with another round of light shower
activity moving northward from the Oregon border. Scattered
showers will continue throughout the day with little in the way of
accumulation. Inherited forecast remains on track with no morning
updates.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...A series of weak troughs will bring several chances
for light showers and near-normal temperatures Sunday through
Wednesday, with no significant impacts. Patchy fog will be
possible each morning. The pattern may turn more active next
weekend, through considerable uncertainty exists at this time.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Satellite and radar imagery
show a weak frontal system slowly making its way westward and
onshore across the Pacific Northwest. A few light showers are
present along the coast, otherwise the rest of the area is mostly
dry this morning. Chances for drizzle/very light rain will
increase this afternoon across the interior of western Washington.
Lingering wrap-around moisture may stick around with some
additional light showers continuing into Monday, in particular
across the Cascades. Precipitation amounts are quite meager with
this system, with a few hundredths to a tenth of an inch of rain
in the lowlands, and up to a quarter of an inch in the Cascades.
Snow levels will lower to around 3500 on Monday allowing for up to
an inch or two of new snow accumulation at Paradise and the
higher mountain passes. Temperatures will be cooler than the last
few days, with high temperatures Sunday and Monday near 50 and low
temperatures in the upper 30s to low 40s.

Tuesday morning looks to be dry across the area as a transient
upper level ridge builds in the wake of the previous system.
Another low pressure system will be right on its toes, however,
with rain arriving on the coast Tuesday afternoon and quickly
spreading inland. Rain will continue overnight as the system moves
inland, with some light showers possibly continuing into early
Wednesday. This system will have more a bit more moisture to work
with, but will be limited by its short duration. A few tenths of
an inch of rain will be possible through the interior, with half
an inch up to nearly an inch over the mountains and along the
Pacific coast. With snow levels near 3000 ft, the Cascade passes
will likely see light accumulating snow through Wednesday.

Even with cloud cover, these systems will keep the low-level
airmass very moist, allowing for patchy fog to develop in spots
each morning. Fog may be locally dense at times.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Shower chances will
taper off through the day on Wednesday, and Thursday also looks to
be mostly dry as an upper level ridge begins to build over the
Pacific Northwest, pushing an upper level trough off to the
southeast.

The placement of these upper level features will be important in
determining the forecast come Friday and into next weekend as an
atmospheric river looks to take aim at northwestern North America.
Ensemble cluster analysis still remains split about 50/50 between
two different scenarios. If the trough is sent more south than
east into the desert Southwest, that keeps the jet stream aimed
farther north, well into British Columbia and the Alaska panhandle,
focusing the bulk of the precipitation there before the next
trough over the Pacific pushes the front southward, making for a
shorter duration of precipitation across western Washington.
However, if the trough is ejected eastward to the south-central
U.S., that may dampen the amplitude of the ridge and the jet will
be aimed farther south towards the U.S./Canada border and
northwestern Washington, making for a much longer period of
duration for precipitation from late Friday through Saturday and
potentially beyond. Snow levels do look to rise above 4000 ft
going into next weekend, but the hydrologic impacts from this
system will depend on where the axis of precipitation sets up.

Long story short, there remains a wide range of possibilities,
from mostly dry to potentially hydrologically significant
rainfall, in the forecast Friday through next weekend. At this
point, the mean solution has the best chances and highest
precipitation focused to the northwestern portions of the region,
including the Olympics and North Cascades.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough will move over the western WA this
afternoon. The trough will shift east tonight, and will be followed
by an upper level ridge building offshore Monday. Expect light flow
in the lower levels.

Low stratus down into MVFR/IFR continues to form north of Puget
Sound and along the coast. There remains some fog affecting the KBLI
terminal through at least mid to late this morning. It remains drier
aloft in Puget Sound this morning (which has slightly delayed lower
ceilings into the busy terminals until later this morning).
Satellite shows increasing clouds to the south, and based on this
trend, MVFR ceilings in Puget Sound will arrive shortly after 18Z
this morning. Light showers will move up between Puget Sound and
Cascades late this morning/afternoon. Expect MVFR decks to remain
through Monday, with average cloud bases lowering down to roughly
1,500 ft early Monday morning. Lower ceilings down to IFR are likely
in the South Interior/Kitsap areas, and the coast Monday morning. A
convergence zone later today/tonight in Snohomish may produce
locally lower ceilings as well. Light winds today out of the
west/northwest at around 5 kt (will be lighter and more variable for
southern terminals).

KSEA...MVFR ceilings will arrive later this morning. Weak
convergence zone to the north later this afternoon into this evening
may lower ceilings to IFR (10% chance tonight, 20% chance Monday
morning). Borderline MVFR/IFR ceilings are expected Monday morning.
Southerly wind 4 to 8 knots may try to come around to west-northwest
this afternoon from the convergence zone. Expect a return to
southerly 4 to 8 knots tonight into Monday morning.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Surface trough digging southward across the
offshore waters today. High pressure will temporarily build in
Monday. A front will arrive Tuesday. High pressure rebuilds
Wednesday and Thursday.

Seas near 10 feet over the inner coastal waters tonight and over
the outer coastal waters through tonight. Seas returning to near
10 feet again over the coastal waters Tuesday night through
Thursday.
