Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak front will bring light rain through Wednesday
morning. A more organized system will move through on Friday,
bringing a brief shot of lowland rain and mountain snow to the
region. Dry conditions are on track to return by the end of the
weekend as high pressure rebuilds.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A high-amplitude ridge will
exit the region tonight while a weak frontal system moves inland.
Rainfall totals are light overnight with 0.25" or so along the
north coast and mountains and just a trace to a few hundredths in
the interior. Expect warmer lows around 40.

There`ll be lingering moisture and light rain (mainly Cascades)
Wednesday morning, then drier weather toward the afternoon.
Building high pressure and offshore flow will help scour the low
clouds out with clearing expected toward the late afternoon and
early evening.

High pressure shifts inland on Thursday for another cool but dry
day. Morning lows will dip into the 30s with near-freezing temps
around the south sound. Partly to mostly sunny conditions in the
afternoon will help highs reach the upper 40s to lower 50s.

Rain and mountain snow returns on Friday as the next frontal
system sweeps through. Snow levels will lower through the day with
a few inches expected at both Stevens and Snoqualmie Passes. A
Puget Sound Convergence Zone Friday night may enhance snowfall
amounts in the central Cascades. 33

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...Western WA in under
northerly flow this weekend as high pressure builds offshore.
There are weak upper level disturbances in the flow for a slight
chance of rain, but overall rainfall amounts look light. The ridge
nudges inland early next week for another dry and relatively
quiet period of weather. Temps will be a little cooler Monday and
Tuesday mornings with lows in the lower 30s and freezing temps
possible. Expect highs in the 40s both days. 33<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A positively tilted upper level ridge over Western
Washington this afternoon is giving way to a weak shortwave trough,
driving a weak frontal system towards the north. High clouds have
begun to build in ahead of this system, and this has burned off
nearly all of the low stratus/fog from this morning (although
pockets remain in the Cascades and also around the Olympics/San
Juans/Kitsap Peninsula. Remaining low stratus will likely clear by
00Z. Winds this afternoon have been light (and sometimes variable)
at or under 3-5 kt.

The previously mentioned frontal system tonight will produce
isolated to scattered showers over Western Washington from west to
east, from 00Z-12Z. Once showers dissipate, ceilings will drop down
to significantly, with widespread IFR/LIFR expected (especially for
southern terminals). Visibilities may also be as low as a quarter of
a mile in spots (if fog develops). Terminals least likely to drop
that far down (remaining at MVFR) are terminals along the Pacific
Coast/Strait of Juan de Fuca). This round of stratus is expected to
be shorter in duration (13Z-21Z) as high pressure builds back in and
clears most of the cloud coverage by Thursday afternoon. Winds will
be light and variable under 3 kt (but will have more of a northerly
component towards Wednesday afternoon/evening).

KSEA...High clouds over the terminal this afternoon (though a few
low clouds around 600 ft remain but will clear this afternoon).
Isolated showers will be in and near the terminal between 06Z-12Z
Wednesday morning. Probabilities for IFR are at 30% (and 20% for
LIFR). Best time for low ceilings/mist or fog to develop is from 15Z-
20Z, with clearing to VFR expected to take place quickly after.
Light winds under 5 kt are expected (will favor a southerly
direction through Wednesday afternoon before turning more
northeast). Variable directions are possible at times.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A positively tilted upper level ridge will move inland
with a weak shortwave trough expected to swing a frontal system over
the waters tonight. Isolated showers are expected Tuesday afternoon
into Wednesday morning. Winds have decreased over the coastal waters
(and the current small craft advisory in place is for high seas of 8
to 12 feet through Wednesday morning). Once the front passes
through, high pressure will build back over land (resulting in light
offshore winds with an additional system expected to arrive Friday).
There will be the potential for morning fog Wednesday morning in
some of the inland waters (and at times next weekend in between
storm systems). Otherwise, the next chance of gusty winds will come
Friday with the next weather maker. These winds are only expected to
be hazardous to small craft. The seas Wednesday into Thursday will
drop 6 to 8 feet, picking back up to 10 to 15 feet Friday into
Saturday before dropping back under 10 feet next weekend.
