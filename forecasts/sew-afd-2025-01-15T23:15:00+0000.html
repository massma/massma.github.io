Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
315 PM PST Wed Jan 15 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will weaken Wednesday night. A weak
frontal system will move through Western Washington on Thursday.
Surface high pressure will rebuild offshore Thursday night. Colder
and drier conditions expected to last through the middle of next
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Current satellite imagery
shows a blanket of fog over Puget Sound and the southern lowlands.
Expecting it to breakout by the late afternoon. High pressure
will break down tonight ahead of a weak cold front that will move
through Western Washington on Thursday. This system will bring the
chance of precipitation (light rain and light mountain snow),
primarily to the North Coast and the North and Central Cascades.
Less than 0.10 inches of precipitation is expected.

An upper level ridge will build offshore Thursday night into
Friday, bringing drier conditions to Western Washington. This
setup and light surface winds may promote the development of
patchy morning fog across Puget Sound. Also, with temperatures
being at/below 32 degrees, freezing fog is also possible for
isolated areas along the southern/southwest interior. Colder
conditions are expected to start on Saturday as the upper level
ridge continues to amplify through weekend. High temperatures on
Friday will be in the mid 40s in the interior and mid 40s along
the coast. By Saturday, low temperatures will be in the mid/upper
20s, and high temperatures in the low 40s. Fog formation on
Saturday will be quite limited with the low temperatures well
below freezing.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Long range models are in
good agreement that a high amplitude ridge will continue to
dominate the upper level flow offshore. Cold and drier conditions
are expected to continue through the rest of the forecast period.
Temperatures across Western Washington will be in the low to mid
40s, and low temperatures will be in the low to mid 20s.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge will begin to break down this
afternoon and move east as a weak shortwave trough dips down into
Western Washington with a frontal system Thursday. Expect the flow
aloft to transition from southwesterly to northwesterly aloft. Light
winds aloft and near the surface under the boundary layer continue
to maintain a large area of lower IFR/LIFR CIGs/VIS in and along the
I-5 corridor (from Chehalis up to Everett and out to the Kitsap
Peninsula). Satellite continues to show some eroding on the edges
of the fog bank, and with these trends there is a slight chance that
many areas will see some scattering of the clouds/fog between 22-00Z
Thursday. However, it may only lightly lift things up to MVFR
conditions before dropping back to IFR/LIFR tonight. Outside of the
I-5 corridor, conditions are mostly clear going into the afternoon.

A weak cold front will sweep through the region tonight. It is
expected to come through pretty dry (though there will be a slight
chance of showers along the coast and Cascades). More widespread fog
or low stratus will develop tonight into Thursday morning (primarily
in Puget Sound but will be spotty outside of this area), and with
more northwest flow and wind, ceilings will have a better chance of
lifting to MVFR and VFR late Thursday afternoon/evening.

Winds going into tonight will solidify out of the south at around 4
to 6 kt, and increase Thursday morning to around 6 to 10 kt before
decreasing from the north at 4 to 6 kt.

KSEA...LIFR stratus just lifted up to IFR (500 ft last observation)
with 3 mi vis due to mist). Based on satellite trends, expectation
is for an improvement only to MVFR by late this afternoon and
evening, with conditions dropping to IFR after 06Z through 20Z
Thursday afternoon. Winds will be less than 5 kt out of the north or
variable through tonight - will transition to the south at 4 to 8 kt
into Thursday morning  with west winds at 4 to 6 kt by late Thursday
afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A ridge inland will slide eastward tonight, with a fast
moving shortwave trough dragging a weak cold front over the waters
tonight/Thursday morning. There will be some wind impacts with an
onshore push during the day Thursday, with winds of 15 to 25 kt over
the coastal waters, and all of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. There
will be a potential for an isolated area of gusty winds in the far
Northern Inland Waters (primarily due to some Fraser River Outflow
from Canada). Otherwise behind the front, flow will be northerly as
ridging builds over Canada. Winds will be light out of the
north/east rest of the weekend into next week.

Seas of 7 to 11 ft range will continue over portions of the coastal
waters into Friday before subsiding this weekend down to 6 to 8 ft.
