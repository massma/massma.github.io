.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A front will move across Western Washington today for
lowland rain, locally breezy winds, and mountain snow. Unsettled
weather continues later Thursday and Friday with troughing over
the Pacific Northwest. Northwest flow aloft over the weekend for
light precipitation at times. Another system expected early next
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system is
approaching Western Washington offshore early this morning with
rain increasing for the coastal waters. Southeast winds are also
increasing this morning ahead of the front, mainly along the
coast, and towards Admiralty Inlet and San Juan Islands. Rain
will move onshore this morning and slide into Puget Sound midday
into the early afternoon. Winds ahead of the front will gust 25 to
40 MPH along the north coast, as well as in the vicinity of
Admiralty Inlet and San Juan Islands, with a few localized gusts
up to 45 MPH possible, but not expected to be widespread. In
addition, mountain snow is forecast with the front today, with
snow levels around 4000 feet. Mainly rain expected through this
evening for Snoqualmie Pass with light snow accumulations (1 to 2
inches) for Stevens Pass.

There may be a brief break in the precipitation tonight with
mainly showers around at times. However, a system offshore will
near Washington and Oregon on Thursday with additional
precipitation sliding northeast into Western Washington later
Thursday. Unsettled weather will then continue on Friday as the
trough axis moves across the Pacific Northwest late in the week.
The main impact from this will be continued snow showers for the
Cascades, with the heaviest QPF focused on the southern half of
Western Washington. For this reason, the Winter Weather Advisory
for the Cascades of Lewis and Pierce Counties has been extended
through Friday. Current forecast snowfall totals for Paradise at
Mount Rainier ranges 14 to 22 inches, with 6 to 12 inches of snow
forecast for White Pass. Precipitation will also slide northward
elsewhere in the Cascades later Thursday into Friday, but lighter
snowfall amounts expected, with snow levels ranging 3500 to 4500
feet. Temperatures through Friday a few degrees below normal for
most areas, with highs in the low to mid 50s.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The aforementioned trough
axis will continue to slowly shift east on Saturday into the
interior Rockies, with a weakening front moving towards Western
Washington later Saturday. Northwesterly flow will generally bring
light precipitation at times over the weekend, primarily for the
Cascades, with an uptick in potential most areas Saturday night.
Another system is expected to impact the area Monday into early
Tuesday with additional precipitation, as well as breezy winds,
and mountain snowfall. However, some uncertainty in the ensembles
exists in the track of the system during this period. With that
said, continued cooler temperatures to continue into early next
week across the area. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Increasing southwest flow aloft ahead of an approaching
frontal system. Widespread VFR ceilings currently as mid-high level
clouds track overhead. However, cigs will deteriorate to MVFR later
this morning (16-18z) for the coast as rainfall commences. Said
conditions are likely to spread towards the inland terminals around
18-20z. Some improvement is possible into the evening as rain breaks
into showers. Here, we`ll see a mixed bag of VFR/MVFR ceilings into
the night hours. Breezy southerly winds expected for most terminals
with varying degrees of SW/SE orientation at times.

KSEA...VFR currently as mid-high level clouds spread across the
region. However, cigs are to drop to MVFR around 19-21z as a frontal
boundary brings widespread rainfall. Additionally, low level wind
shear is likely just ahead of the front this morning with low level
southeasterly flow and strong southerly flow developing aloft. A mix
of VFR/MVFR is possible after the front tracks eastward as minimal
improvement could be observed during the evening. SE winds this
morning turning more S/SW in the afternoon between 8 to 12 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal boundary is taking aim at area waters this
morning as a slue of headlines remain in place. The Gale Warnings
for the coastal waters and East Strait continue until midday.
Elsewhere, wind related small craft advisories are posted for the
remainder of the strait, Northern Inland waters, and newly added
Admiralty Inlet through this evening. Winds will ease Wednesday
night as the frontal system progresses away. However, hazardous seas
are to remain for the coastal waters including the Grays Harbor Bar.
Weak surface ridging rebuilds over the waters later Friday into
Saturday before a weak front arrives during the later half of the
weekend.

As mentioned, seas will top into double digits during the second
half of today and remain hazardous into Friday. Seas are expected to
drop below 10 feet late in the week but briefly, then building back
above 10 feet early next week.
