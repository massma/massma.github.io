Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
444 AM EST Tue Nov 21 2023

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the region moves offshore this afternoon. A low
pressure then moves through the region tonight into early Wednesday.
Low pressure slowly departs to the east Wednesday night through
Thanksgiving. High pressure then builds in and likely remains in
control through at least the first half of the weekend. A low
pressure system may impact the area Sunday into Monday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A chilly start to the morning as overnight temperatures dropped
into the low to mid 20s across the northern interior zones and
the LI Pine Barrens and in the mid 30s for the NYC metro. A
Freeze Warning remains in effect through 8 am this morning.
The growing season officially ends today. Temperatures will
rise into the mid 40s across northern inland zones, while
southern coastal zones on Long Island, NYC, and NE NJ will be in
the low 50s.

Weather remains quiet through late this morning as high pressure
continues to move offshore. A strong upper trough and surface
low will track eastward toward the Mid-Atlantic today and into
tonight pushing a warm front north across the area.

Rain chances begin west to east late this afternoon and into
this evening before becoming likely mid/late evening into the
night. Rain will be moderate at times, with the potential of
heavy rainfall after midnight, mostly across the southern and
eastern zones.

Winds will also increase as the low level jet pivots to the
coast tonight and a secondary low develops. Wind gusts will
range mostly between 30 to 40 mph with some higher gusts
possible. Not enough confidence in a widespread event for a wind
advisory in any of the forecast zones, but far eastern areas in
the Long Island Forks may reach gusts of 45 mph.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /WEDNESDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The heaviest rainfall will probably be over by sunrise Wednesday
west of CT and LI, with the heavy rainfall potential exiting
east of eastern CT and eastern LI by mid morning.

Another area of low pressure develops off of the Carolina/Virginia
coast, which may keep some light isolated showers or drizzle
Wednesday afternoon only for far eastern Long Island and far
eastern SE Connecticut with dry conditions everywhere else. The
low will then push east of the area on Wednesday afternoon with
high pressure building in behind it.

Winds will quickly weaken as the center of low pressure moves
directly overhead Wednesday afternoon, reducing the pressure
gradient.

Wednesday will be notably warmer with highs in the upper 50s to
lower 60s for southern zones and in the mid/low 50s for
northern zones.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
At the start of Wednesday night, low pressure will be exiting to the
east along with any associated rain. The forecast only includes a
slight chance of rain for New London County and far eastern Suffolk
County. The pressure gradient most of Wednesday night will actually
be relatively weak and expecting a lull period for winds. Aloft, a
mid-level shortwave trough will be passing to our south and an
associated surface low will be deepening as it passes to our south
and east early Thursday. This will strengthen the pressure gradient
over the area and lead to gusty conditions.

The low will gradually depart the area, with high pressure building
in thereafter. The high will likely remain in control through at
least the first half of the weekend with zonal flow aloft. The 12z
global guidance is in decent agreement with high pressure winning
out on Saturday. With previous wetter solutions likely impacting the
latest NBM PoP output, went lower with PoPs and expect this trend to
continue.

Sunday through Monday the guidance spread really increases. Stuck
close to NBM during this period because of low confidence. There is
potential for a low pressure system to impact the area, but
strength, timing and location are all in question.

&&

.AVIATION /09Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
High pressure north of the area slides east of New England
today. Low pressure will approach from the southwest today as
well, moving across the area tonight into Wednesday morning.

VFR conditions are forecast through this morning with MVFR
conditions developing this afternoon for NYC and Lower Hudson Valley
terminals (20-22z), and early evening for Long Island and
southern Connecticut terminals (23-01z). Light rain will
develop late in the afternoon and overspread the region in the
evening. Conditions will continue to deteriorate with IFR likely
after 02-03z at NYC terminals and after 04z further east. The
rain could be locally heavy at times early Wednesday morning.

N-NNE winds generally near 5 to 10 kt into early this morning.
NE winds increase through the morning, becoming E-ESE in the
afternoon. Winds will be 10-15 kt with gusts 15-20kt, especially
at coastal terminals before sunset. ESE winds will continue to
increase tonight, becoming 15-20 kt with gusts 25-35 kt,
strongest at coastal terminals.

 ...NY Metro(KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

No unscheduled amendments expected through this morning.

Timing of lowering flight categories this afternoon may be off
by 2-4 hours.

Onset time of rain may be delayed 1-3 hours from forecast this
afternoon/evening.

Start time of wind gusts may be off by 2-3 hours.

OUTLOOK FOR 06Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

Late tonight: IFR with rain. SE winds 10-20 kt with gusts 25 to
35 kt. Winds and gusts strongest near the coast. A few higher
gusts possible, especially at KGON. LLWS for coastal terminals
with SE winds 45-50 kt at 2kft.

Wed: IFR early with lingering rain, especially east. Rain
tapers off late morning into afternoon with eventual improvement
to VFR late. SW-W winds 10-15 kt with gusts near 20-25 kt AM.
NW winds 10-15 kt with gusts 15-20 kt PM. LLWS possible at KGON
early with SE winds 45-50 kt at 2kft.

Thu: VFR with NW to W winds 10-15 kt with gusts 20-25kt.

Fri-Sat: VFR.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure will bring increasing winds and seas late in the
day into tonight. A Gale Warning is in effect for all waters
tonight and into Wednesday.

There will be a lull period for winds Wednesday night as the
pressure gradient briefly decreases with low pressure passing to the
east. However, waves will remain elevated. Thursday morning the
pressure gradient increases again and SCA wind gusts return
likely to all waters. Thereafter, winds and waves remain below
SCA criteria. There is potential for elevated winds and waves
Sunday into early next with with a potential low pressure
system.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>No hydrologic impacts are expected through this afternoon.

Total rainfall from late this afternoon through Wednesday
morning is expected to range from 1 to 2 inches. Given these
rain amounts with antecedent dry conditions and flash flood
guidance, only minor/nuisance flooding is anticipated. The
heaviest rainfall is anticipated after midnight tonight with
the threat of heavy downpours over for most spots by the start
of the Wednesday morning commute.to early evening

There are no hydrologic concerns Wednesday night through early next
week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>There will be an increase in surge tonight into Wednesday morning.
The timing of the highest winds and longest fetch will lead to total
water level forecasts going higher than the surge model`s median.
Used a blend of ETSS, ESTOFS and the 95th percentile of the NYHOPS
surge guidance for the total water level forecast through early
Wednesday evening.

Surge forecasts are mostly in the 2 to 2.5 ft range with some
locally higher surges up to 3 ft. This is on top of higher wave
action expected along the southern shorelines. Parts of the South
Shore Bays and Western LI Sound Shorelines have the higher end of
the surge, more in the 2.5 to 3 ft range.

Overall, expecting minor coastal flooding across most of the
shorelines in the forecast waters for the high tide cycles late
tonight into Wednesday morning, thereby will meet the threshold for
coastal flood advisory. There will probably be some isolated
moderate coastal flooding within the South Shore Bays in the
Southern Nassau to Southwest Suffolk area.

For SE Connecticut and Manhattan island shorelines, they will
experience more isolated minor coastal flooding where the total
water level will just touch the minor coastal flood benchmark.
Therefore for these coastlines, there will just be coastal flood
statements.

The late tonight into Wednesday morning high tide cycle will be the
main tide cycle of concern with regards to coastal flooding as winds
become more westerly for the next high tide cycle. However, while
this will preclude most additional minor coastal flooding, some
residual minor coastal flooding will still be possible for the next
high tide cycle Wednesday afternoon. This would be the case
particularly for those shorelines where water does not totally drain
out and could slosh back and forth in the basin, such as the South
Shore Bays.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
