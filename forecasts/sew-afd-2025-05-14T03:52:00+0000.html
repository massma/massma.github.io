Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
852 PM PDT Tue May 13 2025

.SYNOPSIS...Troughing across the interior West will result in
continued onshore flow into Wednesday for clouds and shower
chances. Another trough Thursday will result in additional light
precipitation. The unsettled weather pattern continues over the
weekend as additional troughing settles across the Pacific
Northwest.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The forecast
remains largely on track this evening, with radar showing some
shower activity starting to develop across portions of the
Cascades tonight. Western Washington generally remains situated
under northwest flow aloft due to troughing across the Western US.
Expect a slight uptick in shower development overnight into early
Wednesday, mostly over the central and northern Sound and the
Cascades. The remainder of the previous discussion follows below,
with updates made to aviation and marine sections. 14

Increasing onshore flow tonight into Wednesday will result in
additional shower development, particularly over the Cascades. A
weak convergence zone may develop late tonight around central
Puget Sound as well. Overall, QPF amounts will remain light into
Wednesday.

A brief period of dry weather Wednesday evening into Wednesday
night as ridging offshore nudges into Western Washington.
Precipitation chances increase again Thursday into Thursday
night as reinforced troughing settles over the Pacific
Northwest. Temperatures will be a few degrees cooler Wednesday
and Thursday with highs mid 50s to low 60s.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...An unsettled weather
pattern looks to continue over the weekend as deeper troughing
develops across the Pacific Northwest. Ensembles are in good
agreement regarding this troughing, with some minor uncertainty in
the depth of the trough. Precipitation chances continue during
this period, peaking Friday night through Saturday. Some
uncertainty exists in the upper level pattern early next week, but
generally zonal flow is expected to continue, resulting in chance
POPs for most areas as shown in the NBM. Temperatures over the
weekend into next week will remain below normal, with highs
ranging in the mid 50s to mid 60s. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Northwest flow aloft as a trough continues to slowly
move east over the Intermountain West. Ceilings remain mostly
MVFR this evening with widespread low stratus over much the area,
with some VFR to the north where the ceiling is more broken.
Expect MVFR to persist tonight as the stratus slowly reforms and
lowers. Again, CIGs look to persist through much of the day
Wednesday and slowly raise, with VFR conditions not likely to
return until around 00Z Thursday. S/SW winds 5 to 10 kt will
continue for most through the TAF period. A push down the Strait
of Juan de Fuca will turn winds northerly from BFI north along the
Puget Sound, including PAE.

KSEA...MVFR CIGs will continue to lower through tonight and into
much of Wednesday, not lifting to VFR until Wednesday evening. Winds
remain S/SW 5 to 10 kt through the TAF period. N winds look to
remain north of the terminal but get close by 01-03Z Thursday.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the NE Pacific will maintain onshore
flow, with westerly pushes down the Strait of Juan de Fuca tonight
and again Wednesday evening, where winds there look to reach Small
Craft Advisory level. Winds over the coastal waters will decrease
tonight into Wednesday as high pressure weakens. A weak frontal
system will traverse the area waters Friday. High pressure will
attempt to squeeze in Saturday into Sunday with another system on
its tail late Sunday into Monday which could require additional
headlines.

Seas 9 to 10 ft at 10 seconds will ease tonight and Wednesday,
becoming 4 to 6 ft by Thursday. Seas rise again to 6 to 8 ft
Friday and may increase further through the weekend close to 10
ft.
