Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
256 AM PDT Sat May 24 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A building upper ridge will lead to warmer and
dry conditions across Western Washington today. A weak front will
produce a few showers and cooler temperatures on Memorial Day
before upper ridging brings a return to drier conditions and
warming temperatures into the middle portion of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A dirty upper ridge axis will
shift onshore over the region this morning and the low level flow
will briefly turn weakly offshore. This will allow interior area
high temperatures to warm 5 to 10 degrees over yesterday under
filtered sunshine. The upper ridge axis will shift east of the
Cascades later today as an upper trough axis digs southward
offshore around 140W. This trough and the associated front will
approach Western Washington during the day on Sunday. Precipitation
will likely hold off along the coast until Sunday evening, but
increasing onshore flow and cloud cover will put a lid on
temperatures. A weak front and the associated trough axis will
press onshore across the area on Monday morning. QPF looks pretty
light...especially over the rain shadowed portions of Puget Sound.
Nonetheless, clouds and shower activity will hold high
temperatures in the 60s for most of the lowlands. Upper ridging
starts to rebuild into Western Washington by Monday
night...heralding a return to drier conditions and warming
temperatures as we move into the middle portion of the coming
week.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...The synoptic pattern
amplifies once again Tuesday into Wednesday as another trough
deepening west of 140W results in a strengthening upper ridge
downstream over the Pacific Northwest. By early Wednesday, 500
millibar heights are still on track to approach 580 decameters,
850 millibar temperatures rise to near 16 C, and thermally
induced low pressure expands northward the coast. All of this
points toward some of the warmest temperatures we`ve seen thus far
this year with interior areas from Seattle southward getting into
the lower (or even mid) 80s F. A majority of the ensembles bring
another weakening front into the area on Thursday, but there`s
considerable uncertainty with regard to its strength and the
ensuing cooling trend that will follow. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridge to the east through Sunday with
southwesterly flow aloft over Western Washington. Light flow in
the lower levels.

High clouds through Sunday morning with the exception of some MVFR
stratus developing along the coast 06z-09z tonight.

KSEA...Variable high clouds. Northeast wind 4 to 8 knots becoming

around 12z Sunday. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over the waters through tonight with a
frontal system moving inland north of Vancouver Island. The high
will weaken Sunday. Weak front moving through the waters late
Sunday night and Monday morning. High pressure will rebuild Monday
night and Tuesday. A thermally induced surface trough will move
up the coastline Tuesday night then shift inland Wednesday.

Low end small craft advisory westerly winds possible in the
Central and Eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca later Monday behind the
front otherwise no headlines through the period. Felton<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
