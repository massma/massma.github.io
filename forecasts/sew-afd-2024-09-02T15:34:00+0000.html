Area Forecast Discussion

.UPDATE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The deep marine layer push this morning is squeezing out
some drizzle along the Pacific coast this morning, limiting
visibility at times, as shown by the recent observations and live
cameras along the Olympic Peninsula. Additionally, some showers
and thunderstorms have developed through the southern Puget Sound
lowlands, with a few lightning strikes being observed in these
storms as they move northward across the region. These storms
should taper off later this morning as the line moves northward,
but additional chances for thunderstorms over the Cascades will
have to be monitored this afternoon into this evening. LH<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A weak upper trough will produce cloudier and cooler
conditions across Western Washington today along with a chance of
showers or isolated thunderstorms. A ridge will rebuild over the
area midweek for a return to dry and warmer conditions.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...Stronger onshore flow this
morning is steadily pulling the marine layer inland across Western
Washington. The complicating factor is an upper level disturbance
rotating northward across the area ahead of a closed upper level
low approaching the southern Oregon coast. This is contributing
to some elevated instability and that has resulted in a couple of
isolated thunderstorms approaching western Lewis and Grays Harbor
counties as of 1 AM PDT (08Z). We`ll have to keep an eye on this
as it lifts northward across the CWA this morning. Aside from
that, mostly cloudy and cooler conditions are expected across the
region today. By afternoon, the primary focus for any thunderstorm
development will be near the Cascade crest.

The atmosphere will stabilize tonight as an upper trough shifts
eastward across Oregon. The marine layer will fill in across the
Western Washington lowlands again tonight, but most areas will
clear out by Tuesday afternoon as upper ridging offshore begins to
rebuild across the area and the low level flow turns more
northerly. Thermally induced low pressure will expand northward to
the Washington coast on Wednesday with the low level flow turning
weakly offshore. Combined with 500 millibars heights in the low
590s dam, this will result in a substantial warm up across the
region. Coastal areas will likely get back in the lower 80s...with
mid 70s to mid 80s across the interior lowlands.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...The upper ridge axis
remains overhead into Thursday with the surface thermal trough
axis still oriented along the coast. Current guidance shifts the
thermal trough inland by Thursday afternoon. This makes the
temperature forecast for the immediate coast a little tricky, but
Thursday is likely to be the warmest day of the week for interior
areas with widespread highs in the 80s away from the water to
around 90 degrees in the Southwest Interior. The upper ridge axis
weakens and gradually shifts eastward Friday into Saturday, but
high temperatures, especially across the interior, will remain 5
to 10 degrees above normal for early September. Ensembles are
trending toward anomalous upper troughing taking up residence
offshore by early next week, but upper ridging over the Interior
West should ensure a warm and dry finish to the upcoming weekend.

.AVIATION...Weak upper level trough moving through Western
Washington with light southwesterly flow aloft becoming light
northwesterly tonight. Onshore flow in the lower levels.

Ceilings below 1000 feet over most of the area this early this
morning. By 13z stratus covering all of the lowlands with ceilings
below 1000 feet. Improving trend 17z-20z with ceilings lifting
into MVFR. MVFR ceilings continuing into Tuesday morning.

KSEA...Ceilings below 1000 feet lifting to 1000-2000 feet around
18z and to 2000 to 3000 feet around 22z. Ceilings lower back down
to 1000-2000 feet 06z-09z Tuesday. Southwest wind 6 to 10 knots.

.MARINE...Onshore flow pattern will continue into Tuesday.
Another thermally induced trough will move northward along the
coast Wednesday with offshore flow expected Wednesday and
Thursday. Onshore flow increasing Friday as the trough shifts
inland.

With the smaller temperature differences between the coast and the
interior late today westerly winds in the Strait of Juan de Fuca
will be a little lighter tonight, 10 to 20 knots versus 15 to 25
knots Sunday evening. Next possible westerly push through the
Strait of Juan de Fuca Friday evening. Felton

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...Onshore flow will allow for a return of cooler
and more moist air to Western Washington today. With fuels
continuing to rapidly dry across the region, the chance for
isolated thunderstorms over the Cascades will have to be monitored
for lightning strikes. While storms are not expected to be
widespread enough for Red Flag conditions, with the little amount
of precipitation expected in these storms, the potential exists
for new fire starts.

Looking toward midweek, warm and dry conditions look to return
as an upper level ridge builds back over the region and low level
offshore flow redevelops. This may mark the next period of
elevated to near-critical fire weather conditions, particularly
over the central Cascades.
