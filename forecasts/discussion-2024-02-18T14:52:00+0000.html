Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
952 AM EST Sun Feb 18 2024

.SYNOPSIS...
Low pressure passes well to the north today and tonight, sending
a weakening cold front into the region early Monday. High
pressure builds in Monday and remains into Wednesday, then
weakens Wednesday night into Thursday as a weak frontal system
approaches from the west. Low pressure will then approach from
the southwest Thursday night into Friday, and pass south and
east of Long Island Friday into Friday night. A weak clipper low
may approach in its wake on Saturday.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
After updating temperatures earlier this morning, they have
remained on track. The rest of the forecast is also panning out
well at this time. No updates to the forecast are needed at this
time.

While low pressure will be tracking from north of the Great
Lakes into southeastern Canada today, with the low well to the
north and little associated moisture, the area will remain dry.
The only impacts from the low will be a few clouds to the north,
and a strong and gusty southwest to west flow.

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH TUESDAY/...
The low over southeastern Canada early this evening will be
moving into the Canadian Maritimes tonight and send and
weakening cold front toward the region. The front may move into
the northern portions of the region early Monday before
dissipating as deep layered height rises will be across the
region as a ridge builds to the west and an upper trough lifts
into Canada. Zonal flow will continue late Monday through
Tuesday as surface high pressure builds over the area Monday and
remains Tuesday. Temperatures will be near seasonal normals.

&&

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...
Forecast mostly follows NBM as it captures the overall trends in
global model guidance during this time. Modeling initially depicts a
sfc high pressure ridge along the East Coast, with an offshore storm
passing well to the SE. Then heights aloft begin to fall Wed night
into Thu as a closed low moves SE into Ontario, with an associated
weak frontal system approaching from the west, and no more than
slight chance PoP NW of NYC during this time.

A srn stream impulse should also partially phase with northern
stream troughing over the Northeast mid to late week, with a sfc low
traversing the Plains and OH/TN valleys Wed night-Thu, then moving
into the Mid Atlantic region and passing offshore Thu night-Fri
while slowly intensifying. Thermal profiles support a period of snow
inland Thu night-Fri morning and mainly rain along the coast,
changing to a light to moderate rain throughout on Fri, with NBM 60-
70% PoP capped at 50% as with the previous forecast.

As the sys pulls away to the E Fri night, precip could end as snow
or a rain/snow mix. Fcst carries a 20% PoP for snow showers into
daytime Sat as some of the guidance shows a trailing nrn stream vort
max and weak sfc clipper low approaching.

Temps should be near normal on Wed, trending to a few degrees above
normal Thu-Fri with the approach of the weak frontal sys and wave of
low pressure. Temps a little below normal expected on Sat after
passage of this system.

.AVIATION /15Z SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>VFR as low pressure passes well to the north. SW winds 15-20 kt
today become more westerly this evening and lower into the
10-15 kt range.

SW gusts around 30 kt already being observed late this morning
along with the coast, and gusts near 30 kt can be expected for
the rest of the day. Inland locations gusting near 20 kt late
this morning will get the higher gusts more in the 25-30 kt
range this afternoon.

Peak gusts this afternoon could briefly reach or exceed 35 kt,
especially at the NYC metros and along the coast. Winds diminish
this evening and veer to the WNW late tonight.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

End time of gusts could occur 1 to 2 hours later than forecast.

OUTLOOK FOR 12Z MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...

Monday through Wednesday: VFR.

Thursday: Slight chance rain/snow showers at KSWF with brief
MVFR cond possible, otherwise VFR.

.MARINE...
Gale warning continues E of Moriches Inlet for this afternoon
and evening, with and SCA elsewhere into late tonight, as a
strong and gusty westerly flow prevails S of low pressure
tracking from the Great Lakes region into SE Canada.

Once gales diminish on the ocean, SCA cond will remain into
Monday morning. On the remainder of the waters SCA conditions
will be ending west to east late tonight/toward Monday morning
as the low moves into the Canadian Maritimes and high pressure
builds into the forecast waters.

Sub advisory conditions are expected on all the waters Monday
afternoon through Wednesday. While winds from late Wed night
into Thu night should remain sub-SCA, incoming swell from an
offshore storm could build ocean seas to 5-7 ft.

ranges from 1/2 to 3/4 inch.
