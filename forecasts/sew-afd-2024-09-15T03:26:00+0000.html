Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS...An upper level trough stationed over the region today
will pivot southward over the weekend, maintaining cloudy skies,
cooler temperatures, and shower activity. Conditions will dry out
on Monday under split flow before another system moves into the
Pacific Northwest mid-week. Ridging is favored to return towards
the end of next week, bringing potential for for drier and warmer
conditions.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level trough will
continue to drop southward from British Columbia throughout the
weekend, maintaining unsettled and cooler conditions. Shower
activity has diminished across most of western Washington, the
exception being across King County where light showers persist in
conjunction with weak convergence. Convergence zone showers will
continue to diminish through the overnight hours. Elsewhere,
cloud cover will stick around with another marine push bringing in
low stratus later tonight.

Precipitation chances across western Washington decrease into
Sunday as the upper level low dives southward towards the
California coast. Wrap-around moisture from the parent low may
generate light showers over the Cascades, while the lowlands and
coast will see sun breaks as drier air moves inland. High pressure
will continue to amplify inland from the west on Monday,
generating split flow aloft and allowing conditions to dry out
ahead of the next incoming system. Temperatures through the
short-term will stay on the cool side for mid September, with
most lower elevations seeing highs in the low to mid 60s and lows
in the upper 40s to low 50s.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...Models continue to show
good agreement over another trough dropping southward on Tuesday,
bringing in another round of cooler temperatures and widespread
showers. Ensembles favor slightly higher rainfall amounts with
this system, with over an inch along the coast and over the
western slopes of the Olympics. This system will once again dive
to the south along the Pacific Coast late Tuesday into Wednesday,
with showers and cloudy skies lingering throughout the day
Wednesday. Lowland temperatures will stay below normal in the low
to mid 60s under the influence of this system.

Thursday and Friday bring in more uncertainty, with the potential
for a weak shortwave trough over southern British Columbia to
generate light shower activity and more cloudy skies over western
Washington. Long-range ensembles favor ridging over the Pacific
Northwest towards the end of next week paired with low level
offshore flow, which would allow conditions to clear out and warm
up. While current forecasts return temperatures to seasonal
normals, a warm start to the fall season cannot be ruled out.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper low continues to slide southward along the
Washington coast this evening through tonight. Southwest flow will
become lighter into Sunday morning as the upper trough axis moves
across Western Washington. MVFR cigs continue this evening across
portions of central Puget Sound with lingering convergence zone
activity. Showers will continue to dissipate into tonight in this
area as the convergence zone becomes less defined. VFR cigs most
other areas this evening with some mid clouds. Stratus will continue
into tonight, especially near the Kitsap Peninsula, with stratus
developing further Sunday morning across the majority of Puget
Sound. Generally MVFR/IFR cigs expected Sunday morning with residual
moisture at the surface. Cigs will improve to VFR midday Sunday into
early Sunday afternoon. Fog development is expected to be limited
Sunday morning, some lower vsbys are possible at KOLM/KBLI. Winds
will lighten tonight and increase northerly later Sunday morning.

KSEA...MVFR cigs continue this evening due to lingering convergence
zone activity over King CO. Cigs will slowly improve to low-end VFR
tonight, before falling to MVFR Sunday morning. There is
approximately a 20% chance of IFR cigs in the morning, particularly
from 13 to 17z. Cigs will slowly lift and scatter early Sunday
afternoon for VFR into Sunday evening. East-northeast winds at 6 to
10 kts will lighten a bit tonight before increasing to 6 to 12 kts
in the afternoon. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

Otherwise, winds will remain out of the northwest post-front over
the coastal waters, with the gustiest winds in the far outer coastal
waters (Sunday into Monday, and Tuesday into Wednesday up to 20 kt
gusts).
