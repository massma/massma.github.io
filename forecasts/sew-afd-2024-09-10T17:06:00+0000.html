Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
1006 AM PDT Tue Sep 10 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A more fall-like pattern is setting up for the rest of
the week as a series of low pressure systems move through the
area. Cooler temperatures, increased cloudiness, and shower
chances will return with the next round of rain expected Tuesday
night into Wednesday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Today, expect onshore flow,
morning stratus clouds and cooler conditions ahead of the next
system that will bring rain late this evening into Wednesday.
Morning marine stratus clouds are likely to linger through the
middle of the afternoon today. This next weather system will move
in from the Gulf of Alaska, keeping the temperatures only in the
upper 60s to low 70s.

The core of the upper level low will move through on Wednesday,
keeping showers in the forecast throughout the day. The period
with the highest likelihood for wetting rains will be during the
day on Wednesday. Storm total QPF from late Tuesday night through
Thursday morning shows around a quarter to half inch along the
coast, with around a quarter inch within Puget Sound. The forecast
for a few inches of snow at the higher elevations of Mount Rainier
is still on track.

Brief and weak shortwave ridging will build in the wake of the low
pressure system for Thursday, confining shower chances to the
mountains but increasing the temperatures slightly back into the
upper 60s and low 70s.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...Models are suggestive of
another trough moving into the region during the later part of the
week, but less is known about how strong or amplified it may be.
Regardless, a cooler pattern with offshore troughing will promote
cooler temperatures and rain chances into the weekend. Both the 6
to 10 day and 8 to 14 day outlook from the Climate Prediction
Center favor below normal temperatures and above normal
precipitation chances for Washington.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft will continue over Western
Washington today as an upper trough digs southward offshore. The low
level flow is light onshore. Low level moisture and weak surface
flow has lead to a mixed bag of ceilings over Western Washington
this morning (MVFR down to localized LIFR). Broad MVFR/VFR ceilings
in stratus remains central Puget Sound this morning, and areas of
low LIFR fog/clouds continue in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and up
to Bellingham. Ceilings will lift to VFR most areas by 18Z-20Z as
mid and high level moisture increases ahead of an approaching
frontal system. Ceilings will deteriorate back to MVFR in light rain
along the coast by this evening with said conditions spreading to
the interior lowlands overnight tonight. Winds will be light out of
the southwest 5 to 8 kt.

KSEA...Low MVFR stratus has lifted to VFR this morning, and will
continue to climb through the morning with cloud bases around or
greater than 5,000 feet (tops around 10,000 feet). A frontal system
this afternoon will bring rain, and fill in ceilings down to around
1,500 to 2,000 feet tonight/Wednesday morning. Southwest winds 5 to
8 kt are expected. 27/HPR<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...Weak onshore flow will turn offshore tonight as a
weak surface low and associated frontal system shifts into the
coastal waters. Winds may briefly touch Small Craft Advisory levels
over portions of the outer coastal waters tonight, but the
vertically stacked nature of this system favors sub-advisory winds
as it reaches the waters. Broad surface ridging rebuilds offshore
for the second half of week for light onshore flow. Another weak
trough is slated to drop into the waters this weekend, but currently
appears to be of little consequence.   27
