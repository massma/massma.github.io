Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
307 PM PST Fri Feb 28 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Upper level ridging will continue to keep conditions
dry and warm through Saturday. Chances of showers will return on
Sunday into earl next week as troughing redevelops. Drier
conditions are expected to resume midweek.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Per recent satellite
imagery, most of the stratus and fog have dissipated across the
region, giving way to partly cloudy skies. Another dry and warm
day is on top, with high temperatures this afternoon generally in
the upper 50s into the lower 60s. Upper level ridging will
continue to shift eastward, allowing for an upper level trough to
approach our region. Cloud cover will begin to increase across the
region along with precipitation chances. Most of the region should
remain dry on Saturday, with the exception being areas along the
coast where light showers could develop.

Aforementioned troughing will sink further into California on
Sunday, which will possibly bring wrap around showers to western
Washington throughout the day. All of these showers have rather
light QPF associated with them, so showers will be hit or miss
across the area. With snow levels hovering around 3500 to 4500
feet, could see a dusting of snow at the ski resorts and higher
elevations.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...As this trough continues to
move eastwards through California, a weak transient ridge will
attempt to build over the Pacific Northwest. Unsettled showers
will likely continue through Wednesday. Afternoon highs will cool
slightly, with temperatures in the low to mid 50s. Troughing looks
to continue at the end of the long term, which will continue to
keep chance of showers in the forecast.
