Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
224 PM EDT Tue Jun 17 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure weakens further today and shifts to the east. A
warm front approaches late tonight and moves through likely
sometime early Wednesday. A cold front then moves through
Thursday evening/night. High pressure builds in Friday, and
generally dominates into the beginning of next week. A warm
front will lift to the north and west of the region Saturday
night into Sunday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Fog lingering across the area with some possible localized dense
fog, but this localized dense fog is more across the ocean
waters. Otherwise, just some minor adjustments for POPs for
showers with no changes to high temperatures for today.

High pressure that has been nosing into northeastern portions of
the area weakens further today and shifts east. The stalled
frontal boundary that is well to our south will start to drift
north as a warm front. No big change in heights aloft, we remain
on the eastern periphery of a broad trough. Several weak
embedded disturbances will pass overhead today into tonight.

Plenty of cloud cover expected again today with rounds of
scattered shower activity. Continues to be a difficult PoP
forecast given weak lift. With the aforementioned disturbances
aloft have more confidence in CAMs today and stuck close to this
guidance.

Temperatures overachieved Monday even with showers and cloud
cover so stuck with NBM today given the similar flow. This
gives highs in the upper 60s to low 70s. Also stuck with NBM for
lows with thick cloud cover expected resulting in a lack of
radiational cooling, 60s across the area.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/...
An active short term period is expected. A warm front moves
through early Wednesday morning with a cold front following
Thursday evening/night. The train of embedded upper level
disturbances also continues. This pattern will result in several
rounds of showers with potential for thunderstorms as well.

Heavy showers and thunderstorms early Wednesday morning, mainly for
NYC and north and west: Early Wednesday morning a warm front will
push through and continue the surge of warm moist air into our area.
Pwats increase to over 2 inches, which is near the daily record for
the OKX upper air sounding. With the passing of the warm front the
some CAMS show a shower/thunderstorm activity. Exact coverage is
difficult to know at this point, but any shower or thunderstorm that
does develop should be able to produce heavy downpours. CAPE is
elevated but has a tall and skinny shape. It is worth noting that
the GFS has stronger mid-level capping and is likely resulting in
the lack of modeled QPF.

Heavy showers and potential for strong thunderstorms Wednesday
afternoon, mainly for areas west of eastern LI and eastern CT:
With the area warm sectored we should be able to destabilize to
about 1000 J/kg of MLCAPE or more in northeast NJ and the Lower
Hudson Valley. A surface trough and shortwave aloft should be
able to trigger some afternoon shower and thunderstorm activity.
Decent instability but once again the profile is tall and skinny
and shear is not too strong. This limits the severe threat and
may be more of a heavy downpour threat, but some stronger cells
could produce sub-severe wind gusts.

Potential for severe thunderstorms Thursday evening: Thursday
continues to be highlighted as a potential severe thunderstorm day
by the CSU-MLP with a 15-30% chance of damaging wind gusts. The
SPC has also outlined the area in a slight risk. The area is
able to destabilize again ahead of an approaching cold front
with guidance consensus around 1000 to 2000 J/kg of MLCAPE. The
triggers for this event will be more focused and stronger than
Wednesday given the falling heights aloft and cold front. The
reason for severe potential comes from a more favorable CAPE
profile and stronger shear than Wednesday.

Aside from the shower and thunderstorm activity in the short term,
the warming temperature trend will continue with temperatures in the
upper 80s to lower 90s on Thursday. Did end up with slightly lower
heat indices because Tds were lowered given the expected mixing
and NBM high bias. Still have Tds in the upper 60s.

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
Key point:

* Potential for high heat and humidity Sunday into early next week.

Global models are in good agreement and forecast largely followed
NBM during this period.

In the wake of a cold frontal passage Thursday, high temperatures
for Friday and Saturday will be a few degrees cooler than Thursday,
and dew points will be much lower. Temperatures will be near normal
to near 5 degrees above normal.
With high pressure centered off the southeast coast Friday into the
beginning of next week, heat and humidity will be building.
Maintained slight chance probabilities across the region for
Saturday night with the potential for showers and thunderstorms to
move over the building ridge, and with a weak shortwave and a warm
frontal passage to the northwest and north. The ridge and heights
build Sunday into Monday, and the ridge remains into Tuesday. With
NBM deterministic high temperatures Saturday into next week near the
25th percentile and the potential for higher temperatures, have
blended in a small percentage of the 75th percentile, resulting in
highs a couple of degrees above the NBM deterministic. The heat and
humidity increase Sunday into Tuesday with temperatures 10 to 15
degrees above normal. There is the potential for reaching heat
advisory criteria Sunday and Monday across northeastern New Jersey,
the lower Hudson Valley, New York City, much of southern Connecticut
and into northern Nassau and northwestern Suffolk counties. And a
few places across northeastern New Jersey into the lower Hudson
Valley may be near warning levels, however, this will depend on dew
points in the upper 60s to lower 70s, which may mix out during the
afternoon.

.AVIATION /18Z TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure east of New England will retreat eastward farther
out into the Atlantic as a warm front approaches from the south.
The front will slowly lift through Wednesday morning.

Widespread LIFR conditions, with low stratus, drizzle and fog,
should persist into early Wed morning. There could still be a
window for brief improvement to IFR at KLGA/KTEB late this
afternoon. Showers and possibly a tstm move across ahead of warm
fropa between 08Z-09Z to 12Z-13Z at most terminals, later at
KGON. Have not yet mentioned thunder in TAF due to very sparse
coverage and uncertainty on exact timing/placement.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

AMD possible for flight categories deviating from forecast.

.OUTLOOK FOR 18Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

Wednesday afternoon: Showers likely with chance of tstms.
MVFR cond expected, brief IFR cond possible.

Wednesday night: Low stratus and fog mainly at the Long
Island/CT terminals with IFR/LIFR cond. MVFR cond possible at
the NYC metros north/west. Showers also likely in the evening,
with chance of tstms mainly E of the NYC metros.

Thursday: Any early morning low cloud/fog improve to VFR by 15Z.
Showers/tstms with IFR then possible in the afternoon/early
evening, some with locally strong winds from the NYC metros
north/west.

Friday through Sunday: Mainly VFR.

.MARINE...
Have a marine weather statement for the rest of this morning for
patchy dense fog on the ocean waters. Areas of fog this morning
across the ocean waters becomes more patchy this afternoon.
Non-ocean waters also have fog but is patchy in coverage for
this morning.

Winds and seas remain below Small Craft Advisory criteria through
Wednesday night. A S/SW flow then increases and some 25 kt gusts are
possible by Thursday afternoon. Especially nearshore gusts. Seas
also likely increase to 4-5 ft across the ocean waters.

With a strong SW to W flow in the wake of a cold front ocean seas
will be near 5 feet Friday into Friday evening. Winds  gradually
diminish late Friday into Friday evening as high pressure builds
toward the waters, and ocean seas fall below 5 feet by late Friday
night. Winds and seas then remain below SCA levels Saturday into
Saturday night.

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
Locally heavy downpours are possible with any showers/thunderstorms
Wednesday morning, Wednesday afternoon and again Thursday
afternoon into the evening. However, the risk of flooding will
be mitigated by the speed of any cells and lack of overall cell
training.

No hydrologic impacts expected thereafter through the beginning
of next week.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
Rip current risk remains moderate today and Wednesday with a
continued E/SE 3ft 7s wave component and parallel/onshore flow.

&&

.OKX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
CT...None.
NY...None.
NJ...None.
MARINE...None.
