Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
239 AM PDT Sat Oct 12 2024

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge will produce dry and mild
conditions across Western Washington this weekend before a series
of frontal systems bring rain, high mountain snow, and locally
gusty winds to the region throughout much of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Skies have cleared across
much of Western Washington overnight as an upper level ridge
rebuilds into the area. Along with clearing skies, patchy dense
fog has formed across much of the Southwest Interior, south Puget
Sound, and outlying river valleys. The stratus/fog will burn off most
areas by late this morning for a mostly sunny and mild afternoon
with light low level offshore flow. Low cloud coverage should be
more extensive on Sunday morning as the low level flow turns
onshore, but will burn off again most areas by midday for a dry
and mild afternoon. We`ll likely start to see some high clouds
begin to filter overhead by later Sunday afternoon as the upper
ridge axis shifts well east of the area ahead of an approaching
frontal system.

Clouds will increase Sunday night and light rain will likely reach
much of the coast before dawn breaks on Monday. Some light rain
will spread to interior areas by Monday afternoon, but this
initial frontal system will be pretty weak and QPF will be light.
This will be just the beginning of a substantial shift in the
pattern toward an extended period of wet and cooler weather
through much of the upcoming week.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...An upper trough digging
southward out of the Gulf of Alaska will send a more potent
frontal system across the area later Tuesday into early Wednesday.
Models have a 140+ knot jet streak offshore sending yet another
front quickly onshore later Wednesday. Periods of rain and locally
gusty winds can be expected with snow levels falling to the higher
passes by Wednesday night or Thursday as a trailing upper trough
axis swings onshore and 500 millibar heights fall below 550 dam
for the first time since last spring. Model consistency and timing
(both deterministic and ensembles) falls off by late next week,
but the overarching trend toward unsettled conditions looks to
remain in place well into the long term forecast period and
beyond.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>South to southeasterly flow today as an upper ridge
remains over the area and an upper low moves across Oregon.
Generally clear skies early this morning with areas of fog
developing, particularly in areas of Puget Sound at KOLM and PWT,
but also near KBLI. Shallow fog expected to continue to become more
widespread into this morning with mostly clear skies and light
winds. LIFR conditions expected in fog through the morning, with
improvements between 17-19z towards VFR for the afternoon with just
a few high clouds. Onshore flow will then increase tonight into
Sunday morning for increasing stratus, initially along the Olympic
Peninsula, and moving into the interior into the morning. This will
result in additional lower cigs on Sunday morning. Light winds
today, increasing a bit more S/SE tonight into Sunday.

KSEA...VFR early this morning. Areas of fog are already developing
east of the terminal towards the Snoqualmie River Valley and Lake
Sammamish. Although probabilities remain 25-35%, mainly between 13-
17z, the combination of light winds and mostly clear skies increases
confidence of LIFR conditions in fog during this period. Any fog
that develops is expected to evaporate between 17z-18z for VFR this
afternoon. Another round of low stratus is expected early Sunday
morning with increasing onshore flow. Light N winds expected to
become VRB this morning before transitioning more southerly into
this afternoon. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure over Western Washington will result in
generally light offshore flow today. Light winds are expected for
the interior waters with south to southeast winds over the Coastal
Waters into Sunday. Southerly winds will increase, especially for
the Coastal Waters, Sunday afternoon into Monday morning as a front
moves across Western Washington. At this time, there is
approximately a 60-80% chance of Small Craft Advisory winds for the
majority of the Coastal Waters, with the highest probabilities along
the outer Coastal Waters. South winds will also increase for
portions of the interior waters Monday morning, particularly
Admiralty Inlet and eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca, but SCA winds
are not expected at this time. Otherwise, a potentially stronger
front looks to move through Tuesday night into Wednesday for another
period of breezy winds. In addition, a post-frontal westerly push is
expected through the Strait of Juan de Fuca later on Wednesday.

Seas of 4 to 6 feet this morning will build to 6 to 8 feet this
afternoon into Sunday. Seas will then build further to 11 to 13 feet
Sunday night into Monday. Seas may briefly subside below 10 feet on
Tuesday, before seas may build above 10 feet Wednesday and into
Thursday. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
