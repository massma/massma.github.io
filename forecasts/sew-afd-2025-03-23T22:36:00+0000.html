.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An atmospheric river will continue to bring heavy
precipitation, locally breezy winds, and high snow levels into
Monday. Upper level ridging will build into Western Washington
Monday night into Tuesday with record temperatures for some areas
on Tuesday. Upper level low offshore approaching Tuesday night
through Wednesday will bring the potential for showers and
thunderstorms. The low will remain offshore with unsettled weather
Thursday and Friday. Another system may impact the area late
Saturday into Sunday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An active pattern
continues through this week, initially driven by an atmospheric
river through Monday, followed by ridging on Tuesday, and an upper
low offshore Wednesday. Additional details organized by timing
below.

Through Monday: An atmospheric river continues to bring heavy
precipitation across Western Washington this afternoon,
particularly for the west slopes of the Olympics, as well as the
Cascades from King County northwards. QPF amounts over the last 12
hours range 1-3" for the western Olympic Peninsula, with
0.50"-2.0" in the Cascades. Heavy precipitation, combined with
high snow levels (peaking around 7000 to 8000 feet) will result in
continued rises on area rivers through Monday. Refer to the
.HYDROLOGY discussion for additional information regarding
potential river flooding. Breezy southerly winds have also been
observed along the coast, and portions of the interior. Gusts so
far have ranged 30 to 50 MPH in the Everett/Admiralty Inlet
region, with a gust of 58 MPH recorded at Hoquiam. Breezy south-
southwest winds will continue through this evening, before winds
slowly ease overnight into Monday. Although precipitation will
decrease in intensity on Monday as upper ridging builds slowly
into Western Washington, continued rain is expected in the
Cascades and Olympics, with a rain shadow prevalent at times
across Puget Sound. Temperatures will warm a few degrees further
on Monday with highs ranging in the mid to upper 50s, and even
some low 60s Pierce County southward.

Tuesday: The aforementioned ridge will build further into Western
Washington on Tuesday. This will help dry conditions out for most
areas, along with warming temperatures. Highs have increased
another degree or two with this forecast update, with mid 60s to
low 70s for most areas. Record high temperatures are possible at
multiple locations, including Olympia (record of 67) and Sea-Tac
(record of 64). Latest NBM probabilities suggest approx. a 40% of
70 degrees or warmer at SEA on Tuesday. In addition, record daily
high minimum temperatures may occur Tuesday morning, with morning
temperatures in the mid 40s to low 50s. Although clouds will
linger, this will be a great day to get outside, with the warmest
temperatures so far this season.

Wednesday: The upper ridge axis will begin to shift eastward on
Wednesday with an approaching trough offshore. This is a rather
anomalous pattern for March with increasing southerly flow aloft
and an approaching negatively tilted trough offshore, leading to
increasing instability across the Pacific Northwest. A near
record warm airmass will remain in place on Wednesday, with highs
again reaching the 60s to possibly mid 70s in the Cascade
Foothills. In addition, given the antecedent moisture from the AR
and south flow, dew points are expected to be in the mid 50s to
low 60s, with a rather muggy environment for Western Washington
standards in early spring. Some uncertainty remains in the
progression and timing of the trough in ensembles during this
period, but pattern recognition suggests a more classic
environment for more widespread convection. Convection may develop
as early as Tuesday night into Wednesday morning and slide
northwards across Western Washington, as noted in some guidance.
The more concerning timeframe for thunderstorms would be Wednesday
PM given increasing instability. Mean LREF (Long Range Ensemble,
includes EPS/GEFS/GEPS members) SBCAPE values for Wednesday range
200-600 J/kg, with some ensemble members (particularly EPS/GEPS)
exceeding 1000 J/kg on Wednesday across the Cascades & south of
Olympia. This is more than sufficient instability for convection,
but the degree of instability will be dependent on the extent of
cloud cover. To further highlight this forecast compared to climo,
ECMWF EFI (Extreme Forecast Index) values from 12z EPS range
above 0.8 for a large swath of Western WA, which signifies CAPE
values very unusual relative to the 20 year average. We continue
to remain outside of Convective Allowing Models (CAMS), and
further details will be refined in regards to hazards, timing,
and location of potential convection, but this is a period to
monitor the forecast over the next few days.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...The upper low will remain
offshore Thursday and Friday, with the return of cooler weather
pattern, as well as periods of lowland rain and mountain snowfall.
Snow levels will fall rapidly Wednesday night into Thursday,
becoming near 3500 to 4000 feet by later Thursday. In addition,
breezy southerly winds are possible at times, especially on
Thursday in areas along the coast and Admiralty Inlet northwards.
There may be a brief break in the steadier precipitation later
Saturday into Saturday night. However, ensembles suggest another
round of showers returns later next weekend with continued deep
troughing offshore. Highs will return to near or slightly below
normal during this period. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mixed bag of MVFR/IFR with localized LIFR in widespread
rain and low ceilings. Areas east of the Olympics have been shadowed
early this afternoon with westerly flow aloft, but precipitation is
expected to fill in across the Puget Sound terminals by the late
afternoon. Southerly winds will continue to increase over the next
few hours, with the strongest winds set to continue along the
Pacific Coast and east of the Strait of Juan de Fuca near KPAE.
Gusts will peak anywhere from 25 to 40 kt this evening before slowly
decreasing into the overnight hours. Breezy conditions may persist
through the early morning hours before calming. Deteriorated
conditions with widespread MVFR/IFR ceilings and vis will continue
throughout the evening with persistent rainfall before slowly
improving throughout the day Monday.

KSEA...MVFR/IFR ceilings and vis and periods of rain will continue
through the evening hours before decreasing in coverage overnight.
Forecast models continue to show winds ramping up to 10-15 kt
between 23z-3z with gusts as high as 35 kt, but confidence is low
that the higher end gusts will materialize this evening.
Visibilities will continue to bounce around in varying rainfall
intensity with low ceilings persisting through the overnight hours
before improving Monday morning.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A frontal system will continue to cross the coastal waters
today, bringing Gale force winds across the outer coastal waters
through the afternoon and lessening to SCA winds through the early
morning hours Monday. Elsewhere, small craft southerlies can be
expected across nearly all interior waters, with a few gusts up to
Gale strength in the Eastern Strait and Admiralty Inlet through the
evening. Winds will ease heading into Monday as a weak surface
ridges builds into Tuesday for calmer conditions.

Another frontal system looks to cross the region on Wednesday into
Thursday for additional rounds of elevated winds and seas.

Combined seas around 8 to 12 feet will remain elevated through the
late evening before subsiding below 10 feet. Seas will build back up
on Wednesday, where waves over the outer waters could reach as high
as 15-20 feet. Seas are favored to ease to below 10 feet once again
heading into next weekend.

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Heavy precipitation continues across Western
Washington this afternoon with an ongoing atmospheric river
pattern. QPF amounts over the last 12 hours have ranged 1-3" along
the western Olympic Peninsula, with 0.5-2.0" in the Cascades.
Additional heavy rain expected through tonight before rainfall
rates ease on Monday. Snow levels will remain 6500 to 8500 feet
through Monday. The Skokomish River is expected to rise above
flood stage tonight and peak in Moderate Flood Stage Monday
morning. A Flood Watch is also in effect for Clallam County as the
Bogachiel is expected to rise near flood stage into Monday.
Additional rivers continue to be monitored, particularly over the
central Cascades, where locally heavier QPF amounts are forecast
in the higher elevations.

Drier weather is expected on Tuesday, allowing for the rivers to
peak or recede. Another round of potentially heavier rain at times
on Wednesday associated with showers and thunderstorms. A cooler
weather pattern returns Thursday into next weekend. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
