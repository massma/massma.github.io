Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
226 PM PDT Thu Jul 3 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Seasonably warm weather for the 4th of July holiday
is expected with a weak trough pushing through the area late this
week. A warming trend is expected by early next week as a ridge of
high pressure build across the western states.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Clouds have been slow to
clear over western Washington today, and temperatures have also
been slow to rise. At 1 PM, readings were from the low to mid 60s
at most locations. A trough moving through southern Canada will
slide east overnight but additional troughing will approach the
region from the west as well. This will provide continued tranquil
weather overnight and low temperatures on the cool side, from the
mid 40s to 50s. As the trough pushes east Friday, it looks to
generate thunderstorm activity but this is expected to remain east
of the forecast area. This will provide more cloudiness in the
afternoon and evening, but temperatures will warm above todays
readings and be near normal in the middle to upper 70s for highs.
The trough exits Friday overnight, allowing a somewhat zonal flow
over the area with a series of weak systems nearby. This will
allow for near normal conditions with lows in the 40s/50s and
highs in the 70s and no significant weather or impacts expected. A
slight warming trend will shape up later on Sunday as heights
begin to rise and a few more lower 80s for highs are expected
especially south.


.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...The first portion of the
coming week should feature a warming trend. Heights will climb
alongside a strengthening mid level ridge of high pressure over
the four corners region. This will bring highs back above normal
on Monday and Tuesday, with lower and mid 80s more common across
the region. With warming overnight lows closer to 60 degrees by
Tuesday morning, the overall heat impact levels will begin to inch
up somewhat. This will bear monitoring in the extended time
period by Tuesday. Some increasing uncertainty by mid week. The
corners ridge becomes quite strong, however a series of troughs
over the north Pacific may do their best to hold mid level ridging
at bay to our south. The current forecast indicates highs
remaining in the low to mid 80s for the mid-latter part of next
week.

One constant through the next several days is that it looks to
remain dry across the forecast area. Storms are expected to be too
far east and then with ridging building in there are no rain
chances to speak of.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Mostly VFR this afternoon with pockets of MVFR ceilings
lingering along the Puget Sound. Clouds will continue to scatter this
afternoon into tonight with generally N/NW surface winds. MVFR stratus
deck will reform along the coast into the early morning Friday and
expand inland, likely staying to the west of the Puget Sound.

KSEA...VFR with mid level clouds continuing to scatter throughout the
afternoon. VFR is favored to continue through the TAF period, with low
potential (15% to 20%) of MVFR ceilings in low stratus drifting east
early Friday morning. NW to NE winds 10 kt or less will continue
through much of the period before shifting SW later Friday afternoon.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure will remain in place across the coastal and
offshore waters today, allowing for evening westerly pushes through the
Strait of Juan de Fuca. The Central and Eastern Strait will see west
winds just below SCA criteria this evening. A front will cross area
waters on Friday, generating another round of strong winds through the
Strait. A Gale Watch has been issued for Friday evening through
Saturday morning, but some uncertainty exists over how strong the winds
will be. A weak front will dissipate over the offshore waters Saturday,
with a series of weak fronts crossing area waters next week.

Seas will remain between 4 to 7 feet through the period.
