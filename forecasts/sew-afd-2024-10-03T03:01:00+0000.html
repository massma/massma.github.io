Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
801 PM PDT Wed Oct 2 2024

.SYNOPSIS...Upper level high pressure rebuilds over the region
tonight and shifts eastward Thursday. The next front will arrive
on Friday with another round of rain expected across Western
Washington. High pressure returns over the weekend with dry and
warmer conditions before the next front brings rain chances back
to the region by around Tuesday.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The current forecast
remains on track with no planned updates tonight. 33

Previous discussion...High pressure continues to build over the
region this afternoon with decreasing cloud cover and temperatures
still near or slightly below normal. Expect that given the
strengthening ridge and light winds overnight that some patches of
fog will develop in the more prone locations like river valleys
and wind-sheltered spots. Otherwise, the clear skies will bring a
rather cool night into the 40s for most and maybe a few spots into
the upper 30s. The ridge moves east on Thursday but expect a dry
day with temperatures trending a few degrees warmer. The next
front likely reaches the coast early Friday, bringing another
round of widespread rain to the region. Amounts along the coast
and in the mountains could reach 1.00 to 1.50 inches, while totals
around half an inch will be more common in the interior. This
will also knock temperatures back down a few degrees cooler again.

Ensemble guidance remains in good agreement that the front will
move east quickly and bring rising heights again over the
weekend. This will bring another round of dry conditions and
temperatures into the upper 60s Saturday.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...Guidance remains consistent
into the start of next week with temperatures climbing another
couple of degrees for Sunday and Monday over Saturday`s afternoon
highs. The next front may reach the region around Tuesday to
increase clouds, cool temperatures, and bring another round of
rain chances. Rainfall amounts with this system are currently less
significant, but enough to maintain another wetting rain across
much of Western Washington.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Westerly flow aloft overnight will become southwesterly
during the day on Thursday as an upper ridge axis shift eastward and
an upper trough and associated frontal system approach the region.
The low level flow is light northerly. Predominant VFR expected
areawide on Thursday with the exception of patchy LIFR in fog across
portions of the Southwest Interior, south Puget Sound, and outlying
river valleys in the morning.

KSEA...VFR. Guidance is currently proposing around a 20% probability
of LIFR fog at the terminal between 13Z and 16Z Thursday morning.
Current thinking is that any fog that forms will be mainly south
and/or west of the airport. Surface winds N/NE 4 to 8 knots. 27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow will continue over the coastal waters in
the wake of a cold front yesterday. Seas continue to be the main
hazard, with recent seas 15 to 18 feet, as observed at Buoy 41.
Seas are highest mainly in the outer water zones. These seas will
gradually taper as we head into Thursday morning generally 9 to 12
feet, and will continue to level off throughout. Seas by Thursday
afternoon will be 6 to 8 feet.

Flow becomes northerly into Thursday as surface ridging builds
throughout British Columbia. Another frontal system will pass
through the area Friday, building seas upwards 9 to 11 feet, with
the highest seas in the outer water zones. Elevated seas will
continue into Saturday morning before subsiding to 3 to 6 feet
over the weekend.
