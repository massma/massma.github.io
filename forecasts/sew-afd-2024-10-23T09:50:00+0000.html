Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
250 AM PDT Wed Oct 23 2024

.SYNOPSIS...A weak trough will move onshore today producing clouds
and a few mainly mountain showers. Weak high pressure aloft will
lead to drier conditions Thursday through much of Friday before a
broad area of low pressure leads to rain, mountain snow, and
occasionally windy conditions over the weekend into early next
week.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Areas of low clouds and
patchy fog continue to spread across much of Western Washington
this morning as low level moisture remains in place and surface
winds are light. A weak cutoff upper low offshore will get kicked
onshore later today. It won`t have much to offer apart from some
clouds and a few showers this afternoon mainly over the Cascades.
Weak ridging aloft will rebuild into the region tonight and
Thursday for drier conditions. The ridge axis will shift east of
the Cascades on Friday and low level offshore flow will increase
as gradients tighten between surface ridging east of the Cascades
and a surface low lifting northeastward into the offshore waters.
East winds will likely become breezy to locally windy at times
Friday into Friday night near gaps in terrain. With the increase in
offshore flow, the air mass will dry out some with less in the way
of morning clouds. Temperatures will warm a few degrees as well on
Friday...especially near the Cascades where downslope effects will
be most realized. Light rain ahead of an approaching front will
reach parts of the coast Friday night, but may take some time to
spread into the interior as the low level air mass will be rather
dry initially.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...The first of series of
fronts will sweep onshore Saturday morning for a wet day across
all of Western Washington. It could become rather windy across
parts of the CWA on Saturday as well as a surface low lifts
northeastward across the region with fairly strong pressure rises
in its wake. A secondary front will push onshore Saturday night
into Sunday keeping rain in the forecast. Snow levels will begin
fall appreciably behind this second front with snow in the higher
passes by Sunday night into Monday morning. Ensembles maintain
good agreement with the upper trough axis moving onshore on Monday
for continued showers and cool conditions. There`s prospects for
briefing drying on Tuesday, but ensembles are nearly unanimous
that the active pattern will persist well into next week. As for
Halloween, well, let`s hope your costume repels water.  27<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...Southwesterly flow aloft becoming more northwesterly
later tonight as transient ridging builds. Low clouds/fog is
becoming widespread this morning given latest satellite
observations. Any lingering VFR obs will erode as IFR/LIFR
conditions take over. This activity is favored to persist before
improving along the coast by 18z and across the interior by 21-23z.
Cloud coverage and fog will again redevelop Wednesday night into
Thursday.

KSEA...Low stratus (with possible fog) has arrived at the terminal
this morning. This activity will stick around before scattering by
20-22z. Easterly winds this morning will become more south-
southwesterly between 3 to 6 kt. More low clouds are expected to
redevelop overnight into Thursday morning.

.MARINE...High pressure remains over area waters and will persist
into Friday. For today, generally benign conditions are expected.
However, a subtle increase in onshore flow this evening will usher a
westerly push through the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Given current high-
resolution guidance, a 30-40% chance of winds meeting SCA criteria
exists this evening along the East Strait. This is a brief window of
potential, for a few hours or so so a headline will not be issued.

Progressing through the week, models remain consistent in a deep
area of low pressure developing over the NE Pac. By Friday night,
this feature will be over the coastal waters, potentially as a 995
mb surface low with breezy winds. Widespread SCA are possible Friday
night into Saturday morning along with the chance for gales over the
coastal waters. The pattern looks to remain active into the
beginning of next week.


Seas currently will hover around 3-5 feet into Friday, before
increasing to 12-14 feet over the weekend.
