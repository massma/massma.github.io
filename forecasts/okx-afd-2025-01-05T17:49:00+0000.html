Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
1249 PM EST Sun Jan 5 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
The region will be in between low pressure to the northeast and high
pressure to the southwest. A quick moving low will pass through the
Mid Atlantic region on Monday and offshore Monday night. High
pressure then slowly builds in from the west through Friday. An
area of low pressure may pass nearby next weekend.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
Dry, but breezy today with a fairly tight pressure gradient
remaining over the area. Winds will diminish more noticeably tonight
as a weakening surface ridge axis approaches from the west. Partly
to mostly sunny during the day, then clouds increase tonight in
association with low pressure well off to our southwest. There
may be more clouds this morning than previously forecast across
the Lower Hudson Valley as stratocu streams down from the
northwest. Have adjusted forecast for the next few hours to
better match satellite and obs. It should remain dry through the
night with an outside shot of a flurry or light snow sneaking
into the extreme SW portion of the forecast area towards
daybreak. NBM with minor local adjustments was used for
temperatures.

&&

.SHORT TERM /MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...
Models and ensembles remain in very good agreement regarding low
pressure which will be passing to our south Monday into Monday
night. A trough axis aloft with an embedded shortwave will shift
east through the OH and TN Valleys. This will strengthen a surface
low which will emerge off the NC coast late in the day Monday into
Monday evening and shift ENE through the night with the trough not
becoming negatively tilted until the overnight hours. This
progressive motion will help keep the heaviest snowfall to our
south, with the northern edge of snowfall likely somewhere over the
Tri-State area. Liquid equivalent precip and snow amount forecasts
are very close to the previous couple of forecasts. Very little to
no accumulation north of the city, and under an inch just about
everywhere else. Best chance of topping an inch will be in the far SW
corner of the forecast area. Period of when snow will be most likely
is mid-late Monday morning through late afternoon.

Winds pick up in the wake of the low Monday night and increase
further on Tuesday as high pressure very slowly builds in from the
NW. Wind chills late Monday night falling into the single digits for
coastal areas and around zero for the northernmost zones. A gusty NW
flow continues through Tuesday with gusts 25-35 mph. Dry, but colder
than normal temperatures with highs only in the upper 20s to lower
30s. Wind chills Tuesday night falling into the single digits for
most locations.

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
Key Points:

* Cold and windy mid to late next week, daytime wind chills in the
  teens for most.

* Next chance for widespread precipitation could arrive next weekend.

By midweek, surface high pressure centered over the Plains begins to
build east. This will not only reinforce the cold air mass in place,
but maintain a tight pressure gradient between the high and
sprawling low pressure anchored over far eastern Canada. With it,
blustery conditions are likely to continue Wednesday and Thursday.
Temperatures, while not record breaking, will run about 10 degrees
below normal and keep much of the region at or below the freezing
mark for through at least Thursday. Add the wind component and the
region could experience wind chills persistently in the single
digits and teens.

By late next week, a closed low near the Southwest may eject east
and attempt to interact with a northern branch disturbance diving
south. Recent operational runs of the GFS and EC have been flirting
with the possibility of deepening low pressure just off the local
coast, though their respective ensemble systems continue to offer
many different solutions at this point. Will be the period to watch
for the next chance of appreciable precipitation should timing of
these features line up.

.MARINE...
SCA for all waters today, ending at various points tonight as the
pressure gradient weakens with diminishing winds and subsiding seas.
Occasional gale gusts are possible during the day however across the
ocean waters. A relatively tranquil period then follows on Monday
before winds and seas ramp up again Monday night with SCA conds by
Tuesday morning for all waters. This will be due to a tight
pressure gradient between building high pressure from the west
and low pressure over eastern Canada. The winds keep SCA
conditions on all waters through at least Thursday, with gales
possible on the ocean at times.
