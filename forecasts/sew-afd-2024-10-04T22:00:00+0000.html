.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front continues to push east, with decreasing
showers. However, a convergence zone is expected to develop after
the frontal passage bring the opportunity of lingering showers.
High pressure builds this weekend bringing slightly warmer
temperatures. Rain chances return by the middle of next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The cold front has pushed
through Western Washington and is currently pushing eastward.
Much of the widespread precipitation has dissipated with the
frontal passage, but a few isolated showers can still be seen on
radar moving into Western Washington, especially a few cells near
the coast with the potential of a lightning strike or two. With
the cold front having pushed eastward, a Puget Sound Convergence
Zone is expected to develop over Snohomish County later this
afternoon bringing the a small chance of thunderstorms.
Precipitation chances will wane to 10-20% into the late evening,
with higher chances of 50-60% over the Cascades. Temperatures are
expected to rebound this weekend along the interior areas as a
surface high pressure settles over Washington this weekend. Expect
temperatures to reach the upper 60s to low 70s along these areas.
High pressure is expected to start moving eastward Monday morning
as a weak cold front begins to move eastward, opening the
opportunity for rain again during the afternoon for northwest
Washington. Accumulations should not be impactful as they will
remain under 0.25 in.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...Some uncertainty exists
whether rain will persist throughout the rest of the week.
Ensemble guidance shows an upper level ridge redeveloping over the
Rockies. However, there is some uncertainty on the future
location of the ridge. There is general agreement through Tuesday
that the ridge axis will remain east of the area, leading to
southwest flow to dominate. The majority of ensemble solutions
favor the ridge to remain to the east allowing the opportunity for
rain to persist throughout the rest of the week. However, a small
group of members favor the ridge axis to build westward, keeping
the upper level trough offshore and hindering rain potential in
the area. If there is any precipitation that does make into the
area, no significant weather impacts are expected. Temperatures
expected to remain near normal throughout the week.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>The cold front has now pass through western Washington,
leaving isolated showers across the region. The cloud deck as
transitioned to a cumulus field, with the exception being over the
convergence zone spanning north King through Snohomish counties.
Ceilings are largely VFR to the north and western parts of the area,
while the Puget Sound and Southwest Interior hold on to MVFR to IFR
ceilings with the convergence zone. Decreasing clouds across the area
will allow VFR conditions to prevail for most tonight, with the
exception being with the convergence zone, which will remain
centered over Snohomish County. It will slowly drift southward and
dissipate late this evening, allowing for PAE and BFI to hold onto
MVFR/IFR conditions through this evening. Rapid cooling this evening
with mostly clear skies should allow some fog to develop,
particularly affecting the fog-prone terminals (such as OLM and PWT)
Saturday morning. Mid to high level cloud cover over the northern
half of the region will keep conditions VFR on Saturday.

Southwest winds peaking this afternoon will gently decrease through
this evening. Winds will become light and variable by early tomorrow
morning, then becoming northerly 4 to 6 kt tomorrow.

KSEA...VFR conditions with scattered clouds and a convergence zone
to the north of the terminal. Breezy southwesterly winds 15 kt
gusting to 30 kt. Winds will slowly ease this evening, becoming
light southwesterly by early this morning. The convergence zone will
drift east/southeast this evening but should remain to the northeast
of the terminal. There is the potential for some fog tomorrow
morning, will have to see how much clearing occurs and if fog is
able to develop and move into the proximity of the terminal. Winds
will subside and become light by early tomorrow morning, then
switching to northerly around 18Z Saturday up 4-6 kt.

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>A cold front has passed through the coastal waters this
morning with a few isolated showers remaining, which will slowly
taper off tonight. Winds will veer to become westerly this afternoon
into tonight. Winds may be a bit breezy down the Strait of Juan de
Fuca this afternoon with occasional gusts reaching 20-30 kt, but
should mostly be confined to the Canadian portion of the Strait, and
the trend will be for the winds to diminish tonight. All hazards
have been cancelled. High pressure will build into the area from the
southwest through the weekend with the next frontal system will
slowly move across the area Monday and Tuesday.

Seas currently 5 to 6 ft will build up to around 7 to 9 ft this
evening, with the highest waves through the northern coastal waters.
Seas will drop to 4 to 5 ft Saturday night through Sunday, then
coming back up to 7 to 8 ft early next week as waves generated from
a low pressure system in the north central Pacific arrive to the
region.
