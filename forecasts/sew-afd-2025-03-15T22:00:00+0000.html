Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
300 PM PDT Sat Mar 15 2025

.SYNOPSIS...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Lowland rain and mountain snow will continue through
Monday as additional systems move across the Pacific Northwest. A
brief break in the weather is possible on Tuesday as an upper
level ridge moves over the region. A series of systems then looks
to move across the region mid to late week, bringing additional
rounds of lowland rain, mountain snow, and breezy winds at times
to western Washington.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Radar shows scattered
shower activity moving northeastward across the region this
afternoon. A few lightning strikes have been detected in some
cells along the coast and across Lewis county over the past few
hours. Thunderstorm chances will continue through this afternoon
and evening, especially for areas along the coast, the south
Sound, and along the Cascade foothills. Main threats with any
thunderstorms are small hail, brief gusty winds, and lightning.
Gusty winds from this morning have started to gradually ease
across the area this afternoon and will continue to do so outside
of convective shower activity through the evening. Additional
rounds of lowland rain and mountain snow are likely as another
round of more widespread precipitation starts to move up from the
south this evening, mainly impacting areas from Snohomish county
southward, before moving into the the Cascades tonight.

Precipitation will become more showery again by Sunday morning as
a broad upper level trough moves across western Washington. With
snow levels generally hovering between 2000-2500 feet, expect
additional snow accumulations at the passes throughout the day.
The pattern will also continue to support chances of isolated
thunderstorm development, with the most likely areas to see any
thunderstorm activity being the coast and across the southern
interior. Morning lows will be in the mid to upper 30s and
afternoon highs will be in the upper 40s to low 50s.

Shower activity will continue into Monday, with latest guidance
hinting at the potential of convergence zone banding developing
across the north-central Sound as onshore flow increases. With
snow levels hovering near 1500 feet early Monday, any banding that
sets up could pull the snow levels down a bit further and could
yield localized heavier snow accumulations for the Cascades.
Shower activity will continue through the day as a weak shortwave
crosses the area. Morning lows will be in the 30s and afternoon
highs will be in the mid 40s to low 50s.

A brief break in the wet weather is then possible on Tuesday as a
weak upper level ridge moves over the area. Lows will be in the
30s and highs will mainly be in the upper 40s to low 50s.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...The weather pattern
remains rather progressive through the long term as a series of
systems moves across western Washington. The next system looks to
arrive on Wednesday, bringing the next round of lowland rain,
mountain snow, and breezy winds to the area. Showers will
continue into Thursday, ahead of yet another system moving into
the region Thursday night into Friday. Conditions look to remain
wet and unsettled heading into the weekend, with snow levels
generally expected to hover between 2000-3500 ft through the
period.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Southwest flow aloft will continue through Sunday with
broad upper level troughing across the Pacific Northwest. VFR/MVFR
cigs continue this afternoon, with MVFR primarily in times of
heavier rain showers. VFR/MVFR will continue into this evening, with
brief improvements for most places to low-end VFR during this
period. Another round of steadier, light rain will move northwards
into Western Washington tonight. Cigs will lower to MVFR/IFR tonight
through Sunday morning. Improvements Sunday afternoon are expected
to be quicker to VFR for most of the region, with a few lingering
showers around. There is also a slight chance (10-15%) for
thunderstorms into this evening. Breezy S/SW winds will become
lighter tonight, before increasing a bit again Sunday afternoon.

.KSEA...VFR/MVFR cigs into this evening (through 04z) with showers
at times. Cigs are expected to lower to MVFR between 04-06z. Cigs
may continue to lower into IFR generally between 10-18z Sunday
morning. Current probabilities of IFR cigs are around 25-35% during
this period. Improvements to VFR are expected Sunday afternoon.
Breezy S/SW winds this afternoon will gradually ease this evening.
Predominantly south winds tonight, although the direction may
fluctuate between SW to SE. S/SW winds increase again Sunday.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Onshore flow continues this afternoon with breezy south to
southwest winds. Small Craft Advisory winds will continue through
the afternoon for the west and central Strait of Juan de Fuca, as
well as northern inland waters and Puget Sound, with winds gradually
easing tonight. Onshore winds will continue into Monday. A westerly
push is expected through the central and eastern Strait of Juan de
Fuca Monday evening, which may result in SCA winds. A brief break in
the weather systems on Tuesday before another frontal system will
move through on Wednesday. Another round of headlines are likely for
the Coast, as well as portions of the interior waters on Wednesday.
Winds will then be elevated at times later in the week.

Seas of 13 to 15 feet this afternoon will gradually subside to 10 to
12 feet later on Sunday. Seas will drop below 10 feet late Monday
before building again Wednesday into Thursday above 10 feet. JD<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>While conditions will remain showery through the
weekend, expect the bulk of the moisture associated with the
incoming system tonight into Sunday to remain well to the south of
the area. Precipitation over the southern Olympics will result in
slight rises on the Skokomish River, with current projections
bringing the river into action stage (cresting roughly a foot
below flood stage) late tonight into early Sunday. Have opted to
cancel the ESF for Mason County with snow levels hovering between
1500-2500 feet and QPF continuing to trend lower. At this time,
flooding is not expected across most of the area`s rivers over the
next 7 days. The exception remains the Skokomish - which could
enter flood stage late next week as additional wet systems move
across the area.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
