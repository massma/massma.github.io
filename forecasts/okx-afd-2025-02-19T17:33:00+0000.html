Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service New York NY
1233 PM EST Wed Feb 19 2025

.SYNOPSIS...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Deepening low pressure across the southeast this afternoon and
evening tracks off the coast well south and east of the area
tonight through Thursday night. Thereafter, a large dome of
high pressure over the mid section of the country builds in
through the weekend. A series of clipper lows will then approach
from the Great Lakes early next week.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Forecast on track through this evening.

The pressure gradient continues to weaken this afternoon
allowing the winds to slowly weaken for the rest of the daytime
hours. A piece of the strong 1050 mb high centered over the
Central US will build in from the Mid Atlantic into this
evening. Temperatures will remain sub freezing this afternoon.
Forecast highs are in the upper 20s to around 30. While winds
weaken, wind chills will still make it feel like it is in the
teens to around 20 this afternoon. High clouds will overspread
the area making for partly to mostly cloudy conditions at times
into the evening.

Low pressure develops across the southeast pushes off the coast
tonight well south and east of the area. Expecting conditions
to remain dry overnight with the thickest clouds closer to the
coast.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.SHORT TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/...
Guidance continues to point towards deepening low pressure tracking
well south and east of the region Thursday, with little to no
snowfall locally the most likely scenario. The only exception may
be across far eastern Long Island, mainly the South Fork, where
a light snowfall remains an unlikely, but possible, solution.

Perhaps more likely than from the surface low, potential exists
for snow showers to develop as the vigorous parent upper low
passes over the region into Thursday evening. Moisture
convergence along a weak inverted trough extending back from the
surface low may also aid this possibility with additional lift.
Hi res CAMs hint at isolated to scattered snow showers moving
thru late day and during the evening hours. Any activity that
does develop is expected to be light, and accumulation, if any,
is likely limited to a coating at best in areas that do see
precip. Otherwise, overcast Thursday night into Friday morning
with temperatures in the teens and 20s.

&&

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
* A gradual warmup into early next week.

A departing storm system over the north Atlantic will be followed by
a confluent, progressive upper flow across the eastern half of the
country. This will allow strong high pressure (1040mb+) centered
over the mid section of the country on Friday to build east and
gradually weaken through the weekend. A gusty NW flow can be
expected on Friday between the departing low and building high, with
gusts of 20 to 30 mph. The high passes to the south Sunday into
Monday. A series of mid level shortwaves then drop out of the
Canadian Rockies, sending clipper lows out of the Great Lakes and
into the Northeast early next week. There is a low chance of rain
and/or snow during this time. There are some small timing
differences early next week and for the most part stayed close to
the National Blend of Models.

Temperatures during this time period will start out 5-10 degrees
below normal, but gradually warm up through the weekend and into
early next week. By next Tuesday, expecting readings about 5-8
degrees above normal, with highs in the mid 40s to around 50, and
lows in the 30s.

.AVIATION /17Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Low pressure passes well south and east of the area Thursday.
An upper level low will cross the area Thursday evening and may
bring scattered snow showers to the terminals.

VFR through most of the TAF period as a mid level deck
overspreads the region and lowers. Prob30 for light snow showers
after 22z Thu. MVFR possible.

WNW winds mostly left of 310 magnetic at 10-15 kt with gusts to
around 20 kt will begin to diminish this evening. Winds then
become NW-N tonight at less than 10 kt and around 10 kt on
Thursday.

 ...NY Metro (KEWR/KLGA/KJFK/KTEB) TAF Uncertainty...

No unscheduled amendments are expected.

.OUTLOOK FOR 18Z THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY...

18Z Thursday: Chance MVFR or lower in light snow mainly for the
terminals E of the NYC metros During the evening hours,
otherwise VFR. NW winds G20-25kt at night.

Friday: VFR. NW winds G20-25 kt.

Saturday and Sunday: VFR.

Monday...Mainly VFR...slight chance of MVFR in showers.

.MARINE...
<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Winds continue to subside this afternoon. Thereafter, sub SCA
conditions persist tonight through Thursday with lighter flow
and seas. Light freezing spray remains possible everywhere
through this morning as well.

Small Craft Advisory conditions likely return Thursday night into
Friday in the wake of deepening offshore low pressure as it tracks
northeast into the North Atlantic. SCA conditions continue
through Friday for all waters, then will be limited to mainly
the ocean through Friday night. Sub advisory conditions then
prevail through the upcoming weekend with a weaker pressure
gradient as a high pressure ridge is followed by a weak trough.<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

.HYDROLOGY...
No hydrologic impacts are expected through the week.

&&

.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...
Low water conditions gradually improve with lightening winds,
but water levels during low tides today may still run 1 to 1.5
ft below MLLW along parts of the Western LI Sound and the
Peconic and Gardiners Bays.
