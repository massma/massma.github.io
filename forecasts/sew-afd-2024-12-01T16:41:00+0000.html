Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Seattle WA
841 AM PST Sun Dec 1 2024

.SYNOPSIS...High pressure will continue to amplify into western
Washington into early next week, allowing for dry conditions and
periods of morning fog and low stratus. The upper ridge will
weaken towards the middle of next week as the next storm system
approaches, bringing in the next chance for widespread
precipitation across the region.

&&

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>Areas of fog and low clouds
this morning with calm winds. Improving conditions expected late
morning and afternoon. Current temps are mostly in the 30s with
highs reaching the 40s to around 50 this afternoon. Expanded fog
coverage based on satellite and trends, otherwise the rest of the
forecast is on track. 33

Previous discussion...High pressure will continue to amplify
northward into western Washington throughout the weekend and into
early next week. This will maintain dry conditions across the
forecast area with patchy fog and low stratus developing each
morning, primarily southwest of the Puget Sound and across the
Chehalis Valley. There will be little change to the overall
weather pattern day-to-day, with highs in the upper 40s to lower
50s and lows near freezing across the lowlands.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...The upper level ridge
will start to break down by Wednesday, with ensembles bringing in
the next chances for widespread precipitation on Thursday and
Friday. This incoming system will bring in warmer temperatures
peaking in the mid to upper 50s for most areas with a more active
weather pattern favored to return by next weekend. Preliminary
precipitation totals are light with the bulk of the incoming
moisture focused over the Olympic Peninsula and northern Cascades.

.AVIATION...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>An upper level ridge will continue to build over Western
Washington today with west to northwest flow aloft. The low level
flow is light offshore. Areas of LIFR in fog and/or low stratus
continues this morning in portions Puget Sound, the Southwest
Interior, Hood Canal, and outlying river valleys. The majority of it
will dissipate by 18-20Z late this morning. VFR is expected this
afternoon. More widespread LIFR in fog is expected to form across
the interior lowlands tonight into Monday morning. Winds will be
light out of the north/northeast at or under 5 kt today, and become
light and variable tonight.

KSEA...Fog/low stratus from BFI continues to blow into SeaTac due to
north winds. Some lifting will start bringing this up towards the
18Z time, but will keep a 1/4SM FG tempo going through that time.
Otherwise, VFR expected for the remainder of the day. Clearing skies
tonight and flat gradients through Puget Sound point toward a higher
likelihood of LIFR in fog for a period on Monday morning. Surface
winds N/NE generally under 6 knots. 27/HPR<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>

&&

.MARINE...<span><div>-- Changed Discussion --</div>High pressure at the surface and aloft will remain across
the coastal and interior waters into midweek. A weak front is slated
to reach the waters on Thursday with a modestly stronger one to
follow on Friday. This will bring a chance of gusty southerly winds
Thursday over 20 kt. 6-8 ft seas today will decrease down to 5-6
feet Monday through Thursday, increasing to 7 to 9 ft with the next
system. 27/HPR<div>-- End Changed Discussion --</div></span>
