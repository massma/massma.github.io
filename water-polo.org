#+TITLE: Water Polo Notes
* General practice outline
- 5-20 minutes warm up & swimming
- 0-10 minutes leg warm up & work
- 30-90 minutes passing (high intensity for leg conditioning)
- 5-10 minutes shooting (usually just enough to warm up goalies)
- 10-40 minutes counter attack drills (high intensity for swim conditioning)
- 0-10 minutes half court 6v6
- 10-30 minutes power play
- 0-10 minutes games
* Seasonal progression of practice structure
- Early practices have more passing
- Later practices move towards more counter attack drills and power
  play practice.
* Example practice
** Pure Conditioning (30 min)
- 100-200yd warm up
- 8-10x100yd alternating hard and steady (e.g., 10x100yd alternating
  1:10/1:20; but quantity and send off varies by lane/ability)
- 200yd leg I.M. warm up
  - 1st 50 tread w/ hands out
  - 2nd 50 tread w/ hands out, and 45 degree lunges
  - 3th 50 field block -> knock down
  - 4th 50 field block -> knock down -> step over legs and 2 stroke recover
- 5 min leg drill; alternate hands on head with hands out; 1st minute
  5s; 2nd minute 10s; 3rd minute 15s, 4th minute 20s, 5th minute 30s
  w/ last 30s all out
** Passing (60 min)
- Squares in pairs (alternate hands; catch weak pass strong;
  catch strong pass weak; catch and turn strong side; catch and turn
  weak side; catch weak, reverse wheel, pass strong). Mix in
  "intensity periods" w/ legging up every pass. [10 min]
- Dog and owner passing [5 min]
- Passing groups of 3-4 (static, rotating clockwise, rotating
  counterclockwise, off hand, strong head, turning, etc.). Leg up
  every time. [10 min]
- Pressure passing in groups of 3-4 [10 min]
- Passing/2m/2mD Box drill in groups of 5-7:
  - 3-5 passers in circle around center and
    center defender; try and pass around circle to get ball into
    center; center immediately dishes. Defender trying to front as
    much/as long as possible as ball moves around circle.
  - Defender goes against every person in group before rotating in a
    new defender [25 min]
- Goalies: leg drills in cage, long passing (lots), pull downs, shooting.
** Counter Attack Drills (30 min)
- 2-way 1 on nobody w/ a trailer
- 2-on-1 continuous
- 3-on-2 continuous
- 4-on-3 continuous (depending on how above go)
* General notes on practices
- Above is an example; they vary a lot (below is a list of drills I
  commonly use in practices)
- Generally (relative to many other coaches): less swimming, less
  static shooting, and less scrimmaging. And more passing and more
  high intensity, high-repetition game situation drills.
- Philosophy is to try and maximize the number of reps each athlete
  gets in the 2 hour practice.
* List of drills
** Warm up & swimming
- 8x50yd warm up freestyle down head up I.M on way back
- 8-10x100yd alternating hard and steady (e.g., 10x100yd alternating
  1:10/1:20; but quantity and send off varies by lane/ability)
- 10x partner pushing (or wrestling) on center line, sprint to
  opposite wall and back head up
- Head up whistle drill
- 10x400yd steady when people are late for practice (heavy swim
  conditioning and incentive to be accountable & on time)
** Leg work
- Jugs
- 5 minute drill
- Lunges
- Water polo I.M.
- pull downs (goalies)
- Various pushing drills: locked, back to front, etc.
- Wall-balls
- Various directional sculling drills
** Passing
- Squares (partners)
- Dog and owner
- Groups of 3-4 passing static & rotating
- Groups of 3-4 width passing w/ person in middle: catch and turn;
  w/ motion; motion w/ right back and drop over head
- Progressive passing competition: everyone start on lanes 3-4, get
  wider w/ each pass until full width of pool, if you drop the ball
  tread water w/ hands on head. Go until there's a winner.
- Pressure passing groups of 3-4
- Box drill (2m & 2mD)
** Shooting
- Air force: static, w/ field block, w/ motion
- Two line greenies
- Positional open shoot
- Shoulder to shoulder: finish w/ half stroke head start
- Two shots against fieldblock, immediate to post up, 2x post up shots.
- 10x shots in a row, pass alternating from 1 and 5.
** Game situation
- 6v5 half court; optional keep score
- 5v5 scrimmage + one person all time offense
- 2-way 1 on nobody w/ a trailer
- 2-on-1 continuous
- 3-on-2 continuous
- 4-on-3 continuous

** End of practice games
- 6v5 for score; losing team must clean up pool
- 2 v 2 v 2: teams of 2: no rules but goal must come off a
  dry pass from partner; scoring team goes into goal.
* Game Strategy/philosophy
** Defense
- Don't give up counter goals (really this is offense)
- Aggressive press high in the lanes w/ communication and help as needed
  - Top 3 anticipate counter
- Take ejection rather than goal
- Solid on power play defense
  - Unless a team has a strong lefty; force shots from 5 or 6; favor
    defense towards 1-2-4
** Offense
- Focus on 3-4 person counter w/ emphasis on getting the ball into front court early
- Half court offense tailored to player strengths; but general
  philosophy is to use drives and picks to get favorable matchups, and
  selective overloads to isolate matchups away from opponents' help
- Important: no turnovers, no random shots, if not involved in play,
  rotate back to defense; don't get countered!
- Structured 6-in power play w/ adaptation as needed
** Subbing
- Subbing is mostly based on mistakes. With the exception of
  championships, if you make a mistake you come out. This is not
  punitive; it allows the coaches to teach on the mistake when it is
  fresh in the mind, and also because in many cases I find that
  mistakes are made because players are tired and need a break
  anyways. In practice this usually leads to rapid subbing where
  everybody plays and no one has to sit for too long. The goal is to
  develop a culture where mistakes are to be avoided, but also not a
  big deal: you come out, talk about it, and then go right back in. No
  big deal.
* Team culture
- Usually create a team/community agreement at the beginning of the
  season.
- Examples from the past:
  - If you miss a practice (for ANY reason) you have to sit out a game
  - If anybody on the team is late to practice, the entire team has to
    do a pretty brutal swim set (10x400yd), and then squares for the
    rest of practice. Historically this led to a culture where no one
    was late; we only had to do this once or twice.
- Open to player input and edits on the agreement before the season,
  but the goal is a high standard of mutual accountability for
  athletes to show up and improve together as a team.
* Other notes
- I'm not very technological so phone based communication is pathetic
  relative to modern norms
- I don't really fly so probably can't coach any tournaments that
  require plane travel
  - However I am very willing (and probably able) to set up
    scrimmages/games with local area teams and players, and go to
    local non-CWPA tournaments.
